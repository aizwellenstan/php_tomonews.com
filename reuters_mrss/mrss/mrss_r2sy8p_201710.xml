      <title>British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn calls for tax on robots</title>

Any robot tax would likely need to fill this gap in public finances.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the British government will collect 716.5 billion for the tax year 2016 to 2017. According to the IFS figures 43.1 percent, or 308.6 billion, of this is contributed by the 30 million people in the British workforce.Separately, a PWC study estimates that 10 million British workers may lose their jobs to automation. If permanent, and not counting the amount the government may save from automation, this would lead to a shortfall of 92.6 pounds, or 30%, in what the British state collects.A flat robot tax may help fill this gap. However, calls for automation to help people live comfortably via state-provided benefits  such as a universal income  may well see automation taxes rise. Such a move would likely scare off private industry from investing in the United Kingdom.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of truck driver being replaced by automation2.

      <title>Football players may be able to be diagnosed for CTE before death</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers may have found a way to diagnose chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players while they are still alive. CTE is a progressive brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. It usually shows up years after taking repeated blows to the head, and can lead to symptoms like confusion, depression, aggression, memory retention, and other forms of cognitive degeneration, according to Quartz. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Researchers have found that people who had CTE displayed abnormal clusters of the tau protein throughout the brain.Doctors believe the tau protein is responsible for killing off neurons.  Researchers at Boston University wanted to look for other markers in people suffering from CTE. Scientists found that people with CTE showed elevated levels of the protein CLL11 in both spinal fluid and the blood around the brain in the skull. They believe the CLL11 protein helps the smallest blood vessels in the brain move oxygen. Higher levels of CLL11 could mean these blood vessels are leaking, which may lead to CTE symptoms. The team at Boston University is now working with a biotech company to develop a blood test to detect CLL11 and diagnose living players. More research still needs to be conducted on the CLL11 protein to confirm it isn't linked with other kinds of neurodegenerative diseases. There's no cure for CTE, but early diagnosis could give players a chance to mitigate the disease.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Football players running into each other2.

      <title>Man responds to nerve stimulation after 15 years in vegetative state</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEAfter being in a vegetative state for 15 years, a French man is showing some signs of consciousness after neurosurgeons implanted a vagus nerve stimulator in his chest, according to a study published Monday in Current Biology.  The man, now 35, was involved in a car accident when he was 20 that left him unconscious, The vagus nerve extends from the brain to other parts in the body, including the heart, lungs and gut. Vagus nerve stimulation is already used to treat people with epilepsy and depression. Researchers wanted to test the ability of vagus nerve stimulation to restore consciousness in a person in a vegetative state. Patients in a vegetative state show no signs consciousness, mental activity or motor function, according to CNN. People in a vegetative state can occasionally open their eyes, however this is just a random physiological response. Vagus nerve stimulation begins with implanting a device in the chest and running a wire under the skin. This wire connects the vagus nerve and the device. The device sends electrical pulses along the nerve to the brain stem, which in turn transmits these impulses to certain brain areas.  Researchers found that after one month of stimulation, the patient’s attention, movements and brain activity significantly improved. The scientists are now planning a larger study to confirm and extend the potential of vagus nerve stimulation. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. A patient in a vegetative state fitted with a vagus nerve stimulator2.

It's supported by a stem that's anchored to the sea floor with mooring cables, which, like the blades, is flexible and can bend under pressure.Inside the turbine head is a magnet electric generator, which transforms wave energy into electricity. The electricity is sent back to the shore via cables, to feed into the grid.Using turbines on just 1% of Japan's coastline can generate roughly 10 gigawatts of energy, equivalent to about 10 nuclear power plants.Apart from tetrapods, the turbines can also harness electricity near coral reefs.They're built to be safe for marine life, with blade speed carefully calibrated so that any animals caught in them can escape unharmed.The team is currently preparing to install two half-scale model turbines that will power LEDs as part of a commercial demonstration.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Any robot tax would likely need to fill this gap in public finances.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the British government will collect 716.5 billion for the tax year 2016 to 2017. According to the IFS figures 43.1 percent, or 308.6 billion, of this is contributed by the 30 million people in the British workforce.Separately, a PWC study estimates that 10 million British workers may lose their jobs to automation. If permanent, and not counting the amount the government may save from automation, this would lead to a shortfall of 92.6 pounds, or 30%, in what the British state collects.A flat robot tax may help fill this gap.

      <title>Football players may be able to be diagnosed for CTE before death</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers may have found a way to diagnose chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players while they are still alive. CTE is a progressive brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. It usually shows up years after taking repeated blows to the head, and can lead to symptoms like confusion, depression, aggression, memory retention, and other forms of cognitive degeneration, according to Quartz. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Researchers have found that people who had CTE displayed abnormal clusters of the tau protein throughout the brain.Doctors believe the tau protein is responsible for killing off neurons.  Researchers at Boston University wanted to look for other markers in people suffering from CTE. Scientists found that people with CTE showed elevated levels of the protein CLL11 in both spinal fluid and the blood around the brain in the skull. They believe the CLL11 protein helps the smallest blood vessels in the brain move oxygen. Higher levels of CLL11 could mean these blood vessels are leaking, which may lead to CTE symptoms. The team at Boston University is now working with a biotech company to develop a blood test to detect CLL11 and diagnose living players. More research still needs to be conducted on the CLL11 protein to confirm it isn't linked with other kinds of neurodegenerative diseases. There's no cure for CTE, but early diagnosis could give players a chance to mitigate the disease.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Football players running into each other2.

The man, now 35, was involved in a car accident when he was 20 that left him unconscious, The vagus nerve extends from the brain to other parts in the body, including the heart, lungs and gut. Vagus nerve stimulation is already used to treat people with epilepsy and depression. Researchers wanted to test the ability of vagus nerve stimulation to restore consciousness in a person in a vegetative state. Patients in a vegetative state show no signs consciousness, mental activity or motor function, according to CNN. People in a vegetative state can occasionally open their eyes, however this is just a random physiological response. Vagus nerve stimulation begins with implanting a device in the chest and running a wire under the skin. This wire connects the vagus nerve and the device. The device sends electrical pulses along the nerve to the brain stem, which in turn transmits these impulses to certain brain areas.

Though not confined to the inside, the crew were required to don spacesuits whenever they went outside.While in the habitat, the crew conducted scientific research, equipment testing, and resource tracking. They also had to learn to prepare food using dehydrated and shelf-stable ingredients.Communications with the outside were subject to a delay of 20 minutes  the same amount of time it takes for signals to reach Mars from Earth.To better understand the psychological impacts of a long-term space mission, they were fitted with sensors that gauged their moods and monitored interactions with other members.The mission is the fifth in a series of six studies designed to help NASA select crews that can do well on an expedition to the red planet.

If a worker accesses the email, this allows the hacker to steal their identity. The hacker then uses the stolen digital credentials to enter the banking network where they begin to comb it for data on their target.This is known as lateral movement. The hack is commonly seen in places where banks' main networks and ATM networks are not separated. Once that data is acquired, the hacker gains access to ATMs. They then order machines to dispense so-called "jackpot" amounts of cash to standby mules, waiting to collect.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

"You can't see it; you can't feel it. You don't know you're getting bombarded by radiation."Space radiation has enough energy to violently collide with nuclei that make up spacecraft shielding and human tissue, according to Science Daily.The collisions cause both the shielding nuclei and space radiation to break-up into several different types of new particles known as secondary radiation.NASA is currently investigating the effects of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on the human body.One of the main difficulties is that it's hard to simulate space radiation on Earth.

Any robot tax would likely need to fill this gap in public finances.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the British government will collect 716.5 billion for the tax year 2016 to 2017. According to the IFS figures 43.1 percent, or 308.6 billion, of this is contributed by the 30 million people in the British workforce.Separately, a PWC study estimates that 10 million British workers may lose their jobs to automation. If permanent, and not counting the amount the government may save from automation, this would lead to a shortfall of 92.6 pounds, or 30%, in what the British state collects.A flat robot tax may help fill this gap. However, calls for automation to help people live comfortably via state-provided benefits  such as a universal income  may well see automation taxes rise.

      <title>Football players may be able to be diagnosed for CTE before death</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers may have found a way to diagnose chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players while they are still alive. CTE is a progressive brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. It usually shows up years after taking repeated blows to the head, and can lead to symptoms like confusion, depression, aggression, memory retention, and other forms of cognitive degeneration, according to Quartz. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Researchers have found that people who had CTE displayed abnormal clusters of the tau protein throughout the brain.Doctors believe the tau protein is responsible for killing off neurons.  Researchers at Boston University wanted to look for other markers in people suffering from CTE. Scientists found that people with CTE showed elevated levels of the protein CLL11 in both spinal fluid and the blood around the brain in the skull. They believe the CLL11 protein helps the smallest blood vessels in the brain move oxygen. Higher levels of CLL11 could mean these blood vessels are leaking, which may lead to CTE symptoms. The team at Boston University is now working with a biotech company to develop a blood test to detect CLL11 and diagnose living players. More research still needs to be conducted on the CLL11 protein to confirm it isn't linked with other kinds of neurodegenerative diseases. There's no cure for CTE, but early diagnosis could give players a chance to mitigate the disease.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Football players running into each other2.

The man, now 35, was involved in a car accident when he was 20 that left him unconscious, The vagus nerve extends from the brain to other parts in the body, including the heart, lungs and gut. Vagus nerve stimulation is already used to treat people with epilepsy and depression. Researchers wanted to test the ability of vagus nerve stimulation to restore consciousness in a person in a vegetative state. Patients in a vegetative state show no signs consciousness, mental activity or motor function, according to CNN. People in a vegetative state can occasionally open their eyes, however this is just a random physiological response. Vagus nerve stimulation begins with implanting a device in the chest and running a wire under the skin. This wire connects the vagus nerve and the device. The device sends electrical pulses along the nerve to the brain stem, which in turn transmits these impulses to certain brain areas.  Researchers found that after one month of stimulation, the patient’s attention, movements and brain activity significantly improved.

It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture, according to the bBC.Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>What are the different type of volcanoes?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEA volcano is an opening in the earth's surface where molten rock can escape. The earth's crust is made up of tectonic plates that shift and move. Volcanoes are often located at the fault lines between these plates. Volcanoes can be active, dormant or extinct, according to Universe Today. There are four major types of volcanoes: cinder cone, composite, shield and lava domes.Cinder cone volcanoes occur when lava is ejected from a volcanic vent. Lava is shot into the air, and pieces accumulate around the vent. Over time, this creates a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a crater at the top. Composite volcanoes contain a conduit system that channels magma to the surface. These volcanoes can have clusters of vents along the sides of the mountain where lava flows out. Shield volcanoes are large, broad volcanoes where lava pours out in thin layers, allowing it to travel farther down the shallow slopes of the volcano. Shield volcanoes build up slowly with hundreds of eruptions creating several layers. Lava domes are created when small masses of thick lava that can't flow far from the source, so domes pile up around the vent. The dome grows by expansion of lava from within, and the mountain forms from material spilling off the sides of the dome.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cinder cone volcano2. Composite volcano 3. Shield volcano4.

By contrast, those given a placebo reported a slight increase in bone loss.According to lead investigator Philip Conaghan of the University of Leeds, the drug has very few side effects, and is reportedly the first to target the diseased bone structure, instead of simply managing pain like most existing treatments.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Gunman Stephen Paddock, a 64-year old white male, from Mesquite, Nev., opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards a country music festival, the Washington Post reported. Authorities found dozens of guns in his hotel room and "in excess of" 19 firearms and bombs at his Nevada residence. At 10:08 p.m., Paddock open fire straight down into the concert venue across the street, a quarter-mile away, according to the Washington Post. Paddock was staying in a suite with two rooms, Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. Authorities think he fired from both rooms to get better angles.

      <title>Catalonia's referendum for independence, explained</title>

It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture, according to the bBC.Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEA volcano is an opening in the earth's surface where molten rock can escape. The earth's crust is made up of tectonic plates that shift and move. Volcanoes are often located at the fault lines between these plates. Volcanoes can be active, dormant or extinct, according to Universe Today. There are four major types of volcanoes: cinder cone, composite, shield and lava domes.Cinder cone volcanoes occur when lava is ejected from a volcanic vent. Lava is shot into the air, and pieces accumulate around the vent. Over time, this creates a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a crater at the top. Composite volcanoes contain a conduit system that channels magma to the surface. These volcanoes can have clusters of vents along the sides of the mountain where lava flows out. Shield volcanoes are large, broad volcanoes where lava pours out in thin layers, allowing it to travel farther down the shallow slopes of the volcano. Shield volcanoes build up slowly with hundreds of eruptions creating several layers. Lava domes are created when small masses of thick lava that can't flow far from the source, so domes pile up around the vent. The dome grows by expansion of lava from within, and the mountain forms from material spilling off the sides of the dome.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cinder cone volcano2. Composite volcano 3. Shield volcano4.

By contrast, those given a placebo reported a slight increase in bone loss.According to lead investigator Philip Conaghan of the University of Leeds, the drug has very few side effects, and is reportedly the first to target the diseased bone structure, instead of simply managing pain like most existing treatments.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The "orbital reflector" is a satellite that will serve no military, commercial or scientific purpose, the museum said. The sculpture will be packed inside a small CubeSat that will be launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket scheduled for early 2018. Once in orbit at a height of approximately 350 miles (575 km), a 100-foot long diamond-shaped balloon will deploy from the satellite. The balloon will reflect sunlight back to Earth, causing the CubeSat to be visible to the naked eye, according to the museum. It will stay in space for about two months. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

"On the global scale, the contamination is really striking," said study coauthor Edward Mitchell, a soil biologist at the University of Neuchtel in Switzerland.Around 200 samples of honey were tested and 75 percent found to contain measurable levels of at least one of the five common neonicotinoids, Science News reported. Neonicotinoids are used on various crops grown in different climates, but still showed up in honey from remote islands with almost no agriculture. The insecticide works by targeting crop-destroying insect's central nervous system. A number of studies have found the insecticide also reduces and weakens honeybee hives. Pesticide levels varied from region-to-region. In North America, 86 percent of samples contained pesticides; Asia, 80 percent; Europe, 79 percent; Africa, 73 percent; the Australian region, 71 percent and South America, 57 percent. Bees and other pollinators are necessary to three-quarters of the world's food crops, but have been declining in number in recent decades, the Guardian reported. Destruction of wild habitats, disease and massive pesticide use are all contributing factors. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Farmers spraying insecticide with honeybees around2.

A team from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory analyzed data from 2002 to 2009 by Mars Odyssey's Neutron Spectrometer (MONS), Science News reported. The neutron spectrometer can't directly detect water, but by measuring neutrons, it can detect hydrogen signature, which could mark the presence of water or other hydrogen-bearing substances, according to Space.com.  Researchers discovered an unexpected amount of hydrogen around the equator by reducing the blurring or "noise" in data using image-reconstruction techniques used for other spacecraft and for medicine, Space.com reported. This improved the spatial resolution of the images to 180 miles (290 km), from the previous resolution of 320 miles (520 km). More research needs to be done to determine if the signature is actual that from water ice. Having water on Mars could mean that future human missions wouldn't need to bring water with them for drinking, cooling equipment or watering plants, thus reducing the number of resources needed for transport.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Catalonia's referendum for independence, explained</title>

It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture, according to the bBC.Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The earth's crust is made up of tectonic plates that shift and move. Volcanoes are often located at the fault lines between these plates. Volcanoes can be active, dormant or extinct, according to Universe Today. There are four major types of volcanoes: cinder cone, composite, shield and lava domes.Cinder cone volcanoes occur when lava is ejected from a volcanic vent. Lava is shot into the air, and pieces accumulate around the vent. Over time, this creates a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a crater at the top. Composite volcanoes contain a conduit system that channels magma to the surface. These volcanoes can have clusters of vents along the sides of the mountain where lava flows out. Shield volcanoes are large, broad volcanoes where lava pours out in thin layers, allowing it to travel farther down the shallow slopes of the volcano. Shield volcanoes build up slowly with hundreds of eruptions creating several layers. Lava domes are created when small masses of thick lava that can't flow far from the source, so domes pile up around the vent. The dome grows by expansion of lava from within, and the mountain forms from material spilling off the sides of the dome.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cinder cone volcano2. Composite volcano 3. Shield volcano4.

"On the global scale, the contamination is really striking," said study coauthor Edward Mitchell, a soil biologist at the University of Neuchtel in Switzerland.Around 200 samples of honey were tested and 75 percent found to contain measurable levels of at least one of the five common neonicotinoids, Science News reported. Neonicotinoids are used on various crops grown in different climates, but still showed up in honey from remote islands with almost no agriculture. The insecticide works by targeting crop-destroying insect's central nervous system. A number of studies have found the insecticide also reduces and weakens honeybee hives. Pesticide levels varied from region-to-region. In North America, 86 percent of samples contained pesticides; Asia, 80 percent; Europe, 79 percent; Africa, 73 percent; the Australian region, 71 percent and South America, 57 percent. Bees and other pollinators are necessary to three-quarters of the world's food crops, but have been declining in number in recent decades, the Guardian reported.

A team from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory analyzed data from 2002 to 2009 by Mars Odyssey's Neutron Spectrometer (MONS), Science News reported. The neutron spectrometer can't directly detect water, but by measuring neutrons, it can detect hydrogen signature, which could mark the presence of water or other hydrogen-bearing substances, according to Space.com.  Researchers discovered an unexpected amount of hydrogen around the equator by reducing the blurring or "noise" in data using image-reconstruction techniques used for other spacecraft and for medicine, Space.com reported. This improved the spatial resolution of the images to 180 miles (290 km), from the previous resolution of 320 miles (520 km). More research needs to be done to determine if the signature is actual that from water ice.

It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture, according to the bBC.Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The earth's crust is made up of tectonic plates that shift and move. Volcanoes are often located at the fault lines between these plates. Volcanoes can be active, dormant or extinct, according to Universe Today. There are four major types of volcanoes: cinder cone, composite, shield and lava domes.Cinder cone volcanoes occur when lava is ejected from a volcanic vent. Lava is shot into the air, and pieces accumulate around the vent. Over time, this creates a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a crater at the top. Composite volcanoes contain a conduit system that channels magma to the surface. These volcanoes can have clusters of vents along the sides of the mountain where lava flows out. Shield volcanoes are large, broad volcanoes where lava pours out in thin layers, allowing it to travel farther down the shallow slopes of the volcano. Shield volcanoes build up slowly with hundreds of eruptions creating several layers. Lava domes are created when small masses of thick lava that can't flow far from the source, so domes pile up around the vent. The dome grows by expansion of lava from within, and the mountain forms from material spilling off the sides of the dome.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cinder cone volcano2. Composite volcano 3. Shield volcano4.

      <title>Much of the world's honey now has pesticides</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONENeonicotinoid pesticides are showing up in honey on every continent with honeybees, according to a new study. "On the global scale, the contamination is really striking," said study coauthor Edward Mitchell, a soil biologist at the University of Neuchtel in Switzerland.Around 200 samples of honey were tested and 75 percent found to contain measurable levels of at least one of the five common neonicotinoids, Science News reported. Neonicotinoids are used on various crops grown in different climates, but still showed up in honey from remote islands with almost no agriculture. The insecticide works by targeting crop-destroying insect's central nervous system. A number of studies have found the insecticide also reduces and weakens honeybee hives. Pesticide levels varied from region-to-region. In North America, 86 percent of samples contained pesticides; Asia, 80 percent; Europe, 79 percent; Africa, 73 percent; the Australian region, 71 percent and South America, 57 percent. Bees and other pollinators are necessary to three-quarters of the world's food crops, but have been declining in number in recent decades, the Guardian reported. Destruction of wild habitats, disease and massive pesticide use are all contributing factors. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Farmers spraying insecticide with honeybees around2.

A team from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory analyzed data from 2002 to 2009 by Mars Odyssey's Neutron Spectrometer (MONS), Science News reported. The neutron spectrometer can't directly detect water, but by measuring neutrons, it can detect hydrogen signature, which could mark the presence of water or other hydrogen-bearing substances, according to Space.com.  Researchers discovered an unexpected amount of hydrogen around the equator by reducing the blurring or "noise" in data using image-reconstruction techniques used for other spacecraft and for medicine, Space.com reported. This improved the spatial resolution of the images to 180 miles (290 km), from the previous resolution of 320 miles (520 km). More research needs to be done to determine if the signature is actual that from water ice. Having water on Mars could mean that future human missions wouldn't need to bring water with them for drinking, cooling equipment or watering plants, thus reducing the number of resources needed for transport.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It was there that the jolly saint formed the reputation for gift-giving that eventually gave rise to the legend of Santa Claus.After his death in 343 AD, the saint was interred in the church, and lay undisturbed until the 11th century.It's widely believed that Italian sailors then took his remains in 1087 and transported them to Bari, where they lie to this day in the Basilica di San Nicola.According to documents obtained by the Turkish archaeologists, however, the remains that were taken supposedly belonged to a local priest.Though many are skeptical, the Turkish team is determined to prove their theory right, and will soon begin the arduous task of removing an intricate mosaic tile by tile in order to get to the untouched tomb.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture, according to the bBC.Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

There are four major types of volcanoes: cinder cone, composite, shield and lava domes.Cinder cone volcanoes occur when lava is ejected from a volcanic vent. Lava is shot into the air, and pieces accumulate around the vent. Over time, this creates a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a crater at the top. Composite volcanoes contain a conduit system that channels magma to the surface. These volcanoes can have clusters of vents along the sides of the mountain where lava flows out. Shield volcanoes are large, broad volcanoes where lava pours out in thin layers, allowing it to travel farther down the shallow slopes of the volcano. Shield volcanoes build up slowly with hundreds of eruptions creating several layers. Lava domes are created when small masses of thick lava that can't flow far from the source, so domes pile up around the vent. The dome grows by expansion of lava from within, and the mountain forms from material spilling off the sides of the dome.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cinder cone volcano2. Composite volcano 3. Shield volcano4.

Most AIDS treatments are engineered to block this replication cycle, effectively stopping the spread of the virus.But though these drugs allow patients to live longer, they do not rid the body of the virus, which hides in reservoirs and re-emerges once treatment stops.A new 'kick and kill' approach aims to get rid of these reservoirs by using a synthetic molecule called SUW133 to wake up the dormant virus, which will then be eliminated by antiretroviral therapy.The technique was developed by researchers from UCLA, Stanford, and the National Institutes of Health, and is detailed in a study published in PLOS Pathogens.When tested on HIV-infected mice that had been given antiretroviral drugs, 25 percent of the once-dormant virus cells died within 24 hours of being reactivated.With further development, researchers believe the technique could lower the viral reservoir enough for infected patients to stop antiretroviral treatment.The molecule will also need to be tested on larger animals before it can go to human trials.

Sharks aren't naturally buoyant, so the infected ones sink to the bottom of the ocean once they stop swimming.Leopard sharks are the most commonly spotted victims of the parasite, but it's a lesser concern for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, since the species is not endangered.Scientists fear, however, that other species are also becoming infected and dying, but just aren't washing up on shore.

According to Business Insider, Uber does not mention the backdoor is any consumer-facing information included with their app. Apple's backdoor is so powerful, it rarely allows third-party companies to access the feature. Security researcher Will Strafach discovered the situation and told Business Insider, "granting such a sensitive entitlement to a third-party is unprecedented as far as I can tell, no other app developers have been able to convince Apple to grant them entitlements they've needed to let their apps utilize certain privileged system functionality." There's no evidence that Uber used the special iPhone feature. Uber told Business Insider the code was not being used and was a leftover from an earlier version of its Apple Watch app. A majority of iPhone apps use software to enable features like the camera or ApplePay known as "entitlements." Many of these can be easily turned on by outside app creators. But certain entitlements are only used by Apple to allow optimal integration with the iPhone.

"On the global scale, the contamination is really striking," said study coauthor Edward Mitchell, a soil biologist at the University of Neuchtel in Switzerland.Around 200 samples of honey were tested and 75 percent found to contain measurable levels of at least one of the five common neonicotinoids, Science News reported. Neonicotinoids are used on various crops grown in different climates, but still showed up in honey from remote islands with almost no agriculture. The insecticide works by targeting crop-destroying insect's central nervous system. A number of studies have found the insecticide also reduces and weakens honeybee hives. Pesticide levels varied from region-to-region. In North America, 86 percent of samples contained pesticides; Asia, 80 percent; Europe, 79 percent; Africa, 73 percent; the Australian region, 71 percent and South America, 57 percent. Bees and other pollinators are necessary to three-quarters of the world's food crops, but have been declining in number in recent decades, the Guardian reported. Destruction of wild habitats, disease and massive pesticide use are all contributing factors. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Farmers spraying insecticide with honeybees around2. Neonicotinoids targeting locust's central nervous system and harming honeybees3. Pesticide contamination levels varies from region-to-region VOICEOVER (in English): "Neonicotinoid pesticides are showing up in honey on every continent with honeybees. Around 200 samples of honey were tested and 75 percent found to contain measurable levels of at least one of the five common neonicotinoids.""The insecticide works by targeting crop-destroying insect's central nervous system. A number of studies have also found the insecticide reduces and weakens honeybee hives." "Pesticide levels varied between regions. In North America, 86 percent of samples contained pesticides; Asia, 80 percent; Europe, 79 percent; Africa, 73 percent; the Australian region, 71 percent and South America, 57 percent."

A team from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory analyzed data from 2002 to 2009 by Mars Odyssey's Neutron Spectrometer (MONS), Science News reported. The neutron spectrometer can't directly detect water, but by measuring neutrons, it can detect hydrogen signature, which could mark the presence of water or other hydrogen-bearing substances, according to Space.com.  Researchers discovered an unexpected amount of hydrogen around the equator by reducing the blurring or "noise" in data using image-reconstruction techniques used for other spacecraft and for medicine, Space.com reported. This improved the spatial resolution of the images to 180 miles (290 km), from the previous resolution of 320 miles (520 km). More research needs to be done to determine if the signature is actual that from water ice. Having water on Mars could mean that future human missions wouldn't need to bring water with them for drinking, cooling equipment or watering plants, thus reducing the number of resources needed for transport.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Most AIDS treatments are engineered to block this replication cycle, effectively stopping the spread of the virus.But though these drugs allow patients to live longer, they do not rid the body of the virus, which hides in reservoirs and re-emerges once treatment stops.A new 'kick and kill' approach aims to get rid of these reservoirs by using a synthetic molecule called SUW133 to wake up the dormant virus, which will then be eliminated by antiretroviral therapy.The technique was developed by researchers from UCLA, Stanford, and the National Institutes of Health, and is detailed in a study published in PLOS Pathogens.When tested on HIV-infected mice that had been given antiretroviral drugs, 25 percent of the once-dormant virus cells died within 24 hours of being reactivated.With further development, researchers believe the technique could lower the viral reservoir enough for infected patients to stop antiretroviral treatment.The molecule will also need to be tested on larger animals before it can go to human trials.

Sharks aren't naturally buoyant, so the infected ones sink to the bottom of the ocean once they stop swimming.Leopard sharks are the most commonly spotted victims of the parasite, but it's a lesser concern for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, since the species is not endangered.Scientists fear, however, that other species are also becoming infected and dying, but just aren't washing up on shore.

According to Business Insider, Uber does not mention the backdoor is any consumer-facing information included with their app. Apple's backdoor is so powerful, it rarely allows third-party companies to access the feature. Security researcher Will Strafach discovered the situation and told Business Insider, "granting such a sensitive entitlement to a third-party is unprecedented as far as I can tell, no other app developers have been able to convince Apple to grant them entitlements they've needed to let their apps utilize certain privileged system functionality." There's no evidence that Uber used the special iPhone feature. Uber told Business Insider the code was not being used and was a leftover from an earlier version of its Apple Watch app. A majority of iPhone apps use software to enable features like the camera or ApplePay known as "entitlements." Many of these can be easily turned on by outside app creators. But certain entitlements are only used by Apple to allow optimal integration with the iPhone.   Uber's app was found to be the only app other than Apple's own apps granted access to the entitlement, Strafach said in an email to Business Insider.Uber says the entitlement isn't being used, and it is working with Apple to remove the API completely from the app.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Building an installation the size of India would could meet the whole world's power needs, according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Doctors Anna Possner and Ken Caldeira from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University pointed out wind speeds over the ocean are on average 70 percent higher than over land, the Independent reported.Land-based wind farms have an upper threshold in the amount of energy that can be converted into electricity due to the combined drag of the spinning blades. Other studies have found land-based farms to have a limit of about 1.5 watts per square meter. Possner and Caldeira say it would be possible to produce 6 watts per square meter in the North Atlantic. Power output would be seasonal, with levels dropping to a fifth of the yearly average during the summer time. Several engineering challenges would have to be overcome. A deep-sea wind farm would have to operate in remote and harsh conditions where waves frequently exceed three meters (9.8 ft), according to the researchers.

The country usually sees about 400 cases per year, but this outbreak has officials concerned because it has spread to the capital and coastal cities for the first time, Vox reported. This year a large number of the cases are pneumonic plague, which targets the lungs and is passed on by coughing, according to the BBC. It is the most deadly form of the disease and can cause death within 24 hours.  The WHO has delivered more than a million doses of antibiotics to help combat the spread of the disease, according to BBC. Two regions on the island nation have been hit particularly hard, eastern Madagascar and the center of the island in Antananarivo.  Public gatherings have been banned in response to the outbreak. Officials have also put in place screening protocols at the country's main airport. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. People wearing face masks on Madagascar street2.

Most AIDS treatments are engineered to block this replication cycle, effectively stopping the spread of the virus.But though these drugs allow patients to live longer, they do not rid the body of the virus, which hides in reservoirs and re-emerges once treatment stops.A new 'kick and kill' approach aims to get rid of these reservoirs by using a synthetic molecule called SUW133 to wake up the dormant virus, which will then be eliminated by antiretroviral therapy.The technique was developed by researchers from UCLA, Stanford, and the National Institutes of Health, and is detailed in a study published in PLOS Pathogens.When tested on HIV-infected mice that had been given antiretroviral drugs, 25 percent of the once-dormant virus cells died within 24 hours of being reactivated.With further development, researchers believe the technique could lower the viral reservoir enough for infected patients to stop antiretroviral treatment.The molecule will also need to be tested on larger animals before it can go to human trials.

A new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows the discoloration of birds in museum collections can be used to estimate the amount of black carbon air over time, Science Daily reported.Researchers from The Field Museum and the University of Chicago sampled over a thousand birds collected over the last 135 years to find out and quantify the effects of soot in the air in Rust Belt cities like Chicago, Detroit and Pittsburgh. To track changes in sootiness, the scientists photographed the birds and measured the light reflected off of them.   They found that older birds were dirtier and new birds were cleaner. The team discovered that soot on birds closely tracks the use of coal over time. Researchers also pointed out that even though newer birds are cleaner, it doesn't necessarily mean U.S. air is less polluted. Many of the pollutants released into the atmosphere today aren't as easily tracked as soot. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Horned larks flying by a coal smokestacks2. Birds have become cleaner over time3.

Building an installation the size of India would could meet the whole world's power needs, according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Doctors Anna Possner and Ken Caldeira from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University pointed out wind speeds over the ocean are on average 70 percent higher than over land, the Independent reported.Land-based wind farms have an upper threshold in the amount of energy that can be converted into electricity due to the combined drag of the spinning blades. Other studies have found land-based farms to have a limit of about 1.5 watts per square meter. Possner and Caldeira say it would be possible to produce 6 watts per square meter in the North Atlantic. Power output would be seasonal, with levels dropping to a fifth of the yearly average during the summer time. Several engineering challenges would have to be overcome. A deep-sea wind farm would have to operate in remote and harsh conditions where waves frequently exceed three meters (9.8 ft), according to the researchers.

That document, CNN says, was part of an email exchange between a writer and a person called Daniel Reed, the Chief Editor of Do Not Shoot Us.DoNotShoot.Us reportedly posed as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, covering stories of police brutality.However, CNN reported that the website’s Facebook page was one of many accounts shut down by Facebook after the social network linked them to a Russian business called the Internet Research Agency.

Dozens of treatment facilities across the country use Bio-Bead plastic pellets to filter chemical and organic contaminants out from sewage, the study from the Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition (CPPC) said, the Guardian reported. The study found several millions of the 3.5 mm wide pellets had been spilled into the surrounding seas.The Bio-Bead system is used by at least 55 sewage plants around the U.K., according to the CPPC. Bio-Beads are used in the last step of the sewage treatment process before treated effluent water is discharged back into rivers or the sea. The CPPC found no systems are currently in place at sewage plants to handle Bio-Bead spills. Plastic microbeads and industrial pellets, like Bio-Beads, are often mistaken for food by fish, birds and other marine wildlife. The plastic kills animals by blocking the digestive tract, but also as a result of exposure to chemical pollutants like DDT and PCBs that attach to the plastic beads in seawater. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Building an installation the size of India would could meet the whole world's power needs, according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Doctors Anna Possner and Ken Caldeira from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University pointed out wind speeds over the ocean are on average 70 percent higher than over land, the Independent reported.Land-based wind farms have an upper threshold in the amount of energy that can be converted into electricity due to the combined drag of the spinning blades. Other studies have found land-based farms to have a limit of about 1.5 watts per square meter. Possner and Caldeira say it would be possible to produce 6 watts per square meter in the North Atlantic. Power output would be seasonal, with levels dropping to a fifth of the yearly average during the summer time. Several engineering challenges would have to be overcome. A deep-sea wind farm would have to operate in remote and harsh conditions where waves frequently exceed three meters (9.8 ft), according to the researchers. Laying transmission cables that stretch across the ocean floor and then connect to floating turbines in open ocean would be another obstacle.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of a floating wind farm2.

Dozens of treatment facilities across the country use Bio-Bead plastic pellets to filter chemical and organic contaminants out from sewage, the study from the Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition (CPPC) said, the Guardian reported. The study found several millions of the 3.5 mm wide pellets had been spilled into the surrounding seas.The Bio-Bead system is used by at least 55 sewage plants around the U.K., according to the CPPC. Bio-Beads are used in the last step of the sewage treatment process before treated effluent water is discharged back into rivers or the sea. The CPPC found no systems are currently in place at sewage plants to handle Bio-Bead spills. Plastic microbeads and industrial pellets, like Bio-Beads, are often mistaken for food by fish, birds and other marine wildlife. The plastic kills animals by blocking the digestive tract, but also as a result of exposure to chemical pollutants like DDT and PCBs that attach to the plastic beads in seawater. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Building an installation the size of India would could meet the whole world's power needs, according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Doctors Anna Possner and Ken Caldeira from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University pointed out wind speeds over the ocean are on average 70 percent higher than over land, the Independent reported.Land-based wind farms have an upper threshold in the amount of energy that can be converted into electricity due to the combined drag of the spinning blades. Other studies have found land-based farms to have a limit of about 1.5 watts per square meter. Possner and Caldeira say it would be possible to produce 6 watts per square meter in the North Atlantic. Power output would be seasonal, with levels dropping to a fifth of the yearly average during the summer time. Several engineering challenges would have to be overcome. A deep-sea wind farm would have to operate in remote and harsh conditions where waves frequently exceed three meters (9.8 ft), according to the researchers. Laying transmission cables that stretch across the ocean floor and then connect to floating turbines in open ocean would be another obstacle.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of a floating wind farm2.

Dozens of treatment facilities across the country use Bio-Bead plastic pellets to filter chemical and organic contaminants out from sewage, the study from the Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition (CPPC) said, the Guardian reported. The study found several millions of the 3.5 mm wide pellets had been spilled into the surrounding seas.The Bio-Bead system is used by at least 55 sewage plants around the U.K., according to the CPPC. Bio-Beads are used in the last step of the sewage treatment process before treated effluent water is discharged back into rivers or the sea. The CPPC found no systems are currently in place at sewage plants to handle Bio-Bead spills. Plastic microbeads and industrial pellets, like Bio-Beads, are often mistaken for food by fish, birds and other marine wildlife. The plastic kills animals by blocking the digestive tract, but also as a result of exposure to chemical pollutants like DDT and PCBs that attach to the plastic beads in seawater. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The report was released by researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Bloomberg reported. According to the report, the gold is lost through sludge and effluent from the country's waste treatment facilities. Scientists believe the gold flecks originate from the watchmaking industry and gold refineries. Switzerland is a major gold-refining hub with about 70 percent of the world's gold making its way through the country's refineries every year, according to Bloomberg. The study looked at 64 water treatment plants and also found around 3,000 kg of silver worth around $1.7 million.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Gold found in Swiss wastewater treatment plants 2.

A new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows the discoloration of birds in museum collections can be used to estimate the amount of black carbon air over time, Science Daily reported.Researchers from The Field Museum and the University of Chicago sampled over a thousand birds collected over the last 135 years to find out and quantify the effects of soot in the air in Rust Belt cities like Chicago, Detroit and Pittsburgh. To track changes in sootiness, the scientists photographed the birds and measured the light reflected off of them.   They found that older birds were dirtier and new birds were cleaner. The team discovered that soot on birds closely tracks the use of coal over time.

Building an installation the size of India would could meet the whole world's power needs, according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Doctors Anna Possner and Ken Caldeira from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University pointed out wind speeds over the ocean are on average 70 percent higher than over land, the Independent reported.Land-based wind farms have an upper threshold in the amount of energy that can be converted into electricity due to the combined drag of the spinning blades. Other studies have found land-based farms to have a limit of about 1.5 watts per square meter. Possner and Caldeira say it would be possible to produce 6 watts per square meter in the North Atlantic. Power output would be seasonal, with levels dropping to a fifth of the yearly average during the summer time. Several engineering challenges would have to be overcome. A deep-sea wind farm would have to operate in remote and harsh conditions where waves frequently exceed three meters (9.8 ft), according to the researchers.

In 2016, Chinese officials confirmed that they lost control of the space station and that it would crash to Earth in 2017 or 2018. The station's orbit has been steadily decaying ever since then. Over the past few weeks, the 8.5-tonne station has dipped below 300 km in altitude. When the Tiangong-1 was operational, the lab orbited at an altitude of 370 km.  The lower the altitude, the denser the atmosphere and the faster the Tiangong-1 will burn up. Most of the space station is expected to disintegrate in the atmosphere, but experts say some parts weighing up to 100 kg could reach the Earth's surface, the Guardian reported.

Arizona State University researchers analyzed minerals in ancient fossilized ash from the most recent mega-eruption and believe the supervolcano became active after two injections of magma into the reservoir underneath the caldera, National Geographic reported. They found the minerals showed that the critical changes in temperature and composition built up over a few decades. Geologists previously thought it took centuries for supervolcanoes to go active.  Supervolcanoes have an eruption magnitude of 8 on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI) and spit out more than 1,000 cubic kilometers (240 cubic miles) of hot rock and ash, according to Science Alert. For now Yellowstone's supervolcano hasn't shown any indications of an eruption, although experts agree there's no way of knowing when the next blast will occur. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Dozens of treatment facilities across the country use Bio-Bead plastic pellets to filter chemical and organic contaminants out from sewage, the study from the Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition (CPPC) said, the Guardian reported. The study found several millions of the 3.5 mm wide pellets had been spilled into the surrounding seas.The Bio-Bead system is used by at least 55 sewage plants around the U.K., according to the CPPC. Bio-Beads are used in the last step of the sewage treatment process before treated effluent water is discharged back into rivers or the sea. The CPPC found no systems are currently in place at sewage plants to handle Bio-Bead spills. Plastic microbeads and industrial pellets, like Bio-Beads, are often mistaken for food by fish, birds and other marine wildlife. The plastic kills animals by blocking the digestive tract, but also as a result of exposure to chemical pollutants like DDT and PCBs that attach to the plastic beads in seawater. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Building an installation the size of India would could meet the whole world's power needs, according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Doctors Anna Possner and Ken Caldeira from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University pointed out wind speeds over the ocean are on average 70 percent higher than over land, the Independent reported.Land-based wind farms have an upper threshold in the amount of energy that can be converted into electricity due to the combined drag of the spinning blades. Other studies have found land-based farms to have a limit of about 1.5 watts per square meter. Possner and Caldeira say it would be possible to produce 6 watts per square meter in the North Atlantic. Power output would be seasonal, with levels dropping to a fifth of the yearly average during the summer time. Several engineering challenges would have to be overcome. A deep-sea wind farm would have to operate in remote and harsh conditions where waves frequently exceed three meters (9.8 ft), according to the researchers. Laying transmission cables that stretch across the ocean floor and then connect to floating turbines in open ocean would be another obstacle.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of a floating wind farm2.

Dozens of treatment facilities across the country use Bio-Bead plastic pellets to filter chemical and organic contaminants out from sewage, the study from the Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition (CPPC) said, the Guardian reported. The study found several millions of the 3.5 mm wide pellets had been spilled into the surrounding seas.The Bio-Bead system is used by at least 55 sewage plants around the U.K., according to the CPPC. Bio-Beads are used in the last step of the sewage treatment process before treated effluent water is discharged back into rivers or the sea. The CPPC found no systems are currently in place at sewage plants to handle Bio-Bead spills. Plastic microbeads and industrial pellets, like Bio-Beads, are often mistaken for food by fish, birds and other marine wildlife.

The report was released by researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Bloomberg reported. According to the report, the gold is lost through sludge and effluent from the country's waste treatment facilities. Scientists believe the gold flecks originate from the watchmaking industry and gold refineries. Switzerland is a major gold-refining hub with about 70 percent of the world's gold making its way through the country's refineries every year, according to Bloomberg. The study looked at 64 water treatment plants and also found around 3,000 kg of silver worth around $1.7 million.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Gold found in Swiss wastewater treatment plants 2.

The geothermal plant in cooperation with Climeworks will remove an estimated 50 metric tons of CO2 from the air each year where it will be turned into limestone and stored in the ground, Quartz reported.The process works by pulling CO2 from the ambient air using a special filter. The heat from the power plant warms up the filter which extracts pure carbon dioxide. The gas is then combined with water and pumped 700 meters underground. When the carbon dioxide reaches with basaltic rock, it forms minerals. The project is still in the pilot phase, but researchers at Climeworks believe negative emissions plants could be set up around the world. One major obstacle in place is the price. Climeworks estimates it runs around $600 to extract one ton of carbon dioxide from the air. However if economies of scale can be utilized and more plants open up, that price would drop significantly.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Geothermal plant in Iceland2.

Crows are highly intelligent and are able to make and use tools. Cigarette butts are the most littered item on the planet with an estimated 4.5 trillion butts thrown away each year, according to Inhabitat. The startup Crowded Cities plans to use the crows to help rid the streets of cigarette butts by teaching them to swap butts for food. The CrowBar is a device with a large funnel for cigarette butts and a peanut dispenser. It works by training crows using a four-step process. The first step presents food next to a cigarette butt, training the birds to expect food from the machine. Second, the machine only gives out food when the crow arrives at the device, teaching the crow how the machine functions.Third, the device only presents a cigarette butt with no food. The crow then starts to look for the food and in the process, knocks the butt into the funnel, dispensing the food. The fourth step involves removing the cigarette butt, but leaving them scattered around the CrowBar. The crow will then start to pick up butts they find and bring them back to the machine. Crowded Cities is currently in the process of putting together a working prototype, Popular Mechanics reported. The next step for researchers will be to study how collecting toxic cigarette butts affects the crows. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Crows using the CrowBar in city park2.

The Tiangong-1 was launched in 2011 as part of China's push to become a space superpower and has been used for manned and unmanned missions, the Guardian reported. In 2016, Chinese officials confirmed that they lost control of the space station and that it would crash to Earth in 2017 or 2018. The station's orbit has been steadily decaying ever since then. Over the past few weeks, the 8.5-tonne station has dipped below 300 km in altitude. When the Tiangong-1 was operational, the lab orbited at an altitude of 370 km.  The lower the altitude, the denser the atmosphere and the faster the Tiangong-1 will burn up. Most of the space station is expected to disintegrate in the atmosphere, but experts say some parts weighing up to 100 kg could reach the Earth's surface, the Guardian reported.

Arizona State University researchers analyzed minerals in ancient fossilized ash from the most recent mega-eruption and believe the supervolcano became active after two injections of magma into the reservoir underneath the caldera, National Geographic reported. They found the minerals showed that the critical changes in temperature and composition built up over a few decades. Geologists previously thought it took centuries for supervolcanoes to go active.  Supervolcanoes have an eruption magnitude of 8 on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI) and spit out more than 1,000 cubic kilometers (240 cubic miles) of hot rock and ash, according to Science Alert. For now Yellowstone's supervolcano hasn't shown any indications of an eruption, although experts agree there's no way of knowing when the next blast will occur. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The geothermal plant in cooperation with Climeworks will remove an estimated 50 metric tons of CO2 from the air each year where it will be turned into limestone and stored in the ground, Quartz reported.The process works by pulling CO2 from the ambient air using a special filter. The heat from the power plant warms up the filter which extracts pure carbon dioxide. The gas is then combined with water and pumped 700 meters underground. When the carbon dioxide reaches with basaltic rock, it forms minerals. The project is still in the pilot phase, but researchers at Climeworks believe negative emissions plants could be set up around the world. One major obstacle in place is the price. Climeworks estimates it runs around $600 to extract one ton of carbon dioxide from the air. However if economies of scale can be utilized and more plants open up, that price would drop significantly.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Geothermal plant in Iceland2.

      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEA Dutch startup is working to train crows to pick up cigarette butts, according to Popular Mechanics. Crows are highly intelligent and are able to make and use tools. Cigarette butts are the most littered item on the planet with an estimated 4.5 trillion butts thrown away each year, according to Inhabitat. The startup Crowded Cities plans to use the crows to help rid the streets of cigarette butts by teaching them to swap butts for food. The CrowBar is a device with a large funnel for cigarette butts and a peanut dispenser. It works by training crows using a four-step process. The first step presents food next to a cigarette butt, training the birds to expect food from the machine. Second, the machine only gives out food when the crow arrives at the device, teaching the crow how the machine functions.Third, the device only presents a cigarette butt with no food. The crow then starts to look for the food and in the process, knocks the butt into the funnel, dispensing the food. The fourth step involves removing the cigarette butt, but leaving them scattered around the CrowBar. The crow will then start to pick up butts they find and bring them back to the machine. Crowded Cities is currently in the process of putting together a working prototype, Popular Mechanics reported. The next step for researchers will be to study how collecting toxic cigarette butts affects the crows. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Crows using the CrowBar in city park2.

Several recalled full conversations, and saw things happening around them- details which were verified by staff present at the time.Theoretically, this could mean the recently deceased are fully aware of their condition, and may even hear the pronouncement of their own death.The study suggests the awareness may be a result of a burst of energy that is released in the brain immediately post-mortem.This finding has been echoed in a 2013 research from the University of Michigan, which observed brain patterns pointing to a 'hyper-alerted state' in nine clinically dead rats.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Building an actual wall would have to overcome environmental issues, and deal with the abundance of privately owned land along the border, Webb County Sheriff Martin Cuellar said, the Dallas News reported. Cuellar says the wall would also have an adverse effect on Mexican shoppers traveling between both countries and could potentially hurt Texas' economy. The sheriff has been looking for $92 million in funding over five years for a virtual wall that uses technology and agents on the ground as an alternative to a physical wall, according to the Dallas News.

The geothermal plant in cooperation with Climeworks will remove an estimated 50 metric tons of CO2 from the air each year where it will be turned into limestone and stored in the ground, Quartz reported.The process works by pulling CO2 from the ambient air using a special filter. The heat from the power plant warms up the filter which extracts pure carbon dioxide. The gas is then combined with water and pumped 700 meters underground. When the carbon dioxide reaches with basaltic rock, it forms minerals. The project is still in the pilot phase, but researchers at Climeworks believe negative emissions plants could be set up around the world. One major obstacle in place is the price. Climeworks estimates it runs around $600 to extract one ton of carbon dioxide from the air.

Crows are highly intelligent and are able to make and use tools. Cigarette butts are the most littered item on the planet with an estimated 4.5 trillion butts thrown away each year, according to Inhabitat. The startup Crowded Cities plans to use the crows to help rid the streets of cigarette butts by teaching them to swap butts for food. The CrowBar is a device with a large funnel for cigarette butts and a peanut dispenser. It works by training crows using a four-step process. The first step presents food next to a cigarette butt, training the birds to expect food from the machine. Second, the machine only gives out food when the crow arrives at the device, teaching the crow how the machine functions.Third, the device only presents a cigarette butt with no food. The crow then starts to look for the food and in the process, knocks the butt into the funnel, dispensing the food. The fourth step involves removing the cigarette butt, but leaving them scattered around the CrowBar. The crow will then start to pick up butts they find and bring them back to the machine. Crowded Cities is currently in the process of putting together a working prototype, Popular Mechanics reported. The next step for researchers will be to study how collecting toxic cigarette butts affects the crows. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Crows using the CrowBar in city park2.

Several recalled full conversations, and saw things happening around them- details which were verified by staff present at the time.Theoretically, this could mean the recently deceased are fully aware of their condition, and may even hear the pronouncement of their own death.The study suggests the awareness may be a result of a burst of energy that is released in the brain immediately post-mortem.This finding has been echoed in a 2013 research from the University of Michigan, which observed brain patterns pointing to a 'hyper-alerted state' in nine clinically dead rats.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Iceland opens world's first 'negative emissions' power plant</title>

The geothermal plant in cooperation with Climeworks will remove an estimated 50 metric tons of CO2 from the air each year where it will be turned into limestone and stored in the ground, Quartz reported.The process works by pulling CO2 from the ambient air using a special filter. The heat from the power plant warms up the filter which extracts pure carbon dioxide. The gas is then combined with water and pumped 700 meters underground. When the carbon dioxide reaches with basaltic rock, it forms minerals. The project is still in the pilot phase, but researchers at Climeworks believe negative emissions plants could be set up around the world. One major obstacle in place is the price. Climeworks estimates it runs around $600 to extract one ton of carbon dioxide from the air. However if economies of scale can be utilized and more plants open up, that price would drop significantly.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Geothermal plant in Iceland2.

      <title>Startup training crows to pick up cigarette butts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEA Dutch startup is working to train crows to pick up cigarette butts, according to Popular Mechanics. Crows are highly intelligent and are able to make and use tools. Cigarette butts are the most littered item on the planet with an estimated 4.5 trillion butts thrown away each year, according to Inhabitat. The startup Crowded Cities plans to use the crows to help rid the streets of cigarette butts by teaching them to swap butts for food. The CrowBar is a device with a large funnel for cigarette butts and a peanut dispenser. It works by training crows using a four-step process. The first step presents food next to a cigarette butt, training the birds to expect food from the machine. Second, the machine only gives out food when the crow arrives at the device, teaching the crow how the machine functions.Third, the device only presents a cigarette butt with no food. The crow then starts to look for the food and in the process, knocks the butt into the funnel, dispensing the food. The fourth step involves removing the cigarette butt, but leaving them scattered around the CrowBar. The crow will then start to pick up butts they find and bring them back to the machine. Crowded Cities is currently in the process of putting together a working prototype, Popular Mechanics reported. The next step for researchers will be to study how collecting toxic cigarette butts affects the crows. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Crows using the CrowBar in city park2.

Several recalled full conversations, and saw things happening around them- details which were verified by staff present at the time.Theoretically, this could mean the recently deceased are fully aware of their condition, and may even hear the pronouncement of their own death.The study suggests the awareness may be a result of a burst of energy that is released in the brain immediately post-mortem.This finding has been echoed in a 2013 research from the University of Michigan, which observed brain patterns pointing to a 'hyper-alerted state' in nine clinically dead rats.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Iceland opens world's first 'negative emissions' power plant</title>

The geothermal plant in cooperation with Climeworks will remove an estimated 50 metric tons of CO2 from the air each year where it will be turned into limestone and stored in the ground, Quartz reported.The process works by pulling CO2 from the ambient air using a special filter. The heat from the power plant warms up the filter which extracts pure carbon dioxide. The gas is then combined with water and pumped 700 meters underground. When the carbon dioxide reaches with basaltic rock, it forms minerals. The project is still in the pilot phase, but researchers at Climeworks believe negative emissions plants could be set up around the world. One major obstacle in place is the price. Climeworks estimates it runs around $600 to extract one ton of carbon dioxide from the air. However if economies of scale can be utilized and more plants open up, that price would drop significantly.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Geothermal plant in Iceland2.

Crows are highly intelligent and are able to make and use tools. Cigarette butts are the most littered item on the planet with an estimated 4.5 trillion butts thrown away each year, according to Inhabitat. The startup Crowded Cities plans to use the crows to help rid the streets of cigarette butts by teaching them to swap butts for food. The CrowBar is a device with a large funnel for cigarette butts and a peanut dispenser. It works by training crows using a four-step process. The first step presents food next to a cigarette butt, training the birds to expect food from the machine. Second, the machine only gives out food when the crow arrives at the device, teaching the crow how the machine functions.Third, the device only presents a cigarette butt with no food. The crow then starts to look for the food and in the process, knocks the butt into the funnel, dispensing the food. The fourth step involves removing the cigarette butt, but leaving them scattered around the CrowBar. The crow will then start to pick up butts they find and bring them back to the machine. Crowded Cities is currently in the process of putting together a working prototype, Popular Mechanics reported. The next step for researchers will be to study how collecting toxic cigarette butts affects the crows. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Crows using the CrowBar in city park2.

Several recalled full conversations, and saw things happening around them- details which were verified by staff present at the time.Theoretically, this could mean the recently deceased are fully aware of their condition, and may even hear the pronouncement of their own death.The study suggests the awareness may be a result of a burst of energy that is released in the brain immediately post-mortem.This finding has been echoed in a 2013 research from the University of Michigan, which observed brain patterns pointing to a 'hyper-alerted state' in nine clinically dead rats.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Ovarian cancer found to originate in the fallopian tubes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONEA preliminary study of ovarian cancer suggests that its roots may lie in the fallopian tubes  a finding that could provide new insight in treating the deadly disease.Science Daily reports that ovarian cancer is the fifth largest cause of cancer deaths in women, as it is often detected late, or is already widespread at the time of diagnosis.Scientists from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston examined cell samples from women with ovarian tumors and those with cancer risk factors. The analysis revealed that all the women had mutations affecting the cancer-guarding p53 gene, and had lost chromosomes containing one or both BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor-suppressing genes.They tracked the source of the mutations to the fallopian tubes, where the cancer developed and eventually migrated to the ovaries over a 6.5-year period. Once in the ovaries, the cancer progressed more rapidly, metastasizing within two years.The team’s findings will need to be further validated by additional studies, but the results provide a glimmer of hope.With such a large window from fallopian tube to ovarian cancer, scientists believe new methods should be developed to detect and treat the cancer while it’s still localized in the tubes.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Last Thursday, the state issued a conditional utility permit to allow Musk's Boring Co. to dig a 10.3-mile tunnel between the state-owned section of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, between the Baltimore city line and Maryland 175 in Hanover, according to the Baltimore Sun. The Boring Co. wants to construct two 35-mile tunnels between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., according to Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn, reported the Baltimore Sun.The U.S. government owns roughly two-thirds of the land Musk's company plans to dig underneath, Ars Technica reported. The 10-mile section approved by Maryland will be the first section of the underground system.   Once completed, the hyperloop trip between Washington and New York would only take 29 minutes. The Boring Co. looks to reduce traffic congestion by creating a low-cost system of tunnels.

The goal of the program is to "forge a public opinion environment where keeping trust is glorious. It will strengthen sincerity in government affairs, commercial sincerity, social sincerity and the construction of judicial credibility," according to the Chinese government, Wired reported. Participation currently remains voluntary, but by 2020, it will be mandatory. The Chinese Communist Party has given out eight licenses to private companies to develop systems and algorithms for a social credit score system. The two biggest projects are run by China Rapid Finance and Sesame Credit. Sesame Credit, for example, gives individuals a score between 350 and 950 points based on a private algorithm calculated from five factors: credit history, contract obligation fulfillment, personal characteristics, behavior and preferences and interpersonal relationships.Once the system becomes mandatory, people with low scores could be punished with slower internet speeds, be denied access to certain restaurants, night clubs or golf courses and restricted from traveling. Scores will also affect an individual's rental applications, ability to secure insurance or a loan, as well as social security benefits. Citizens with low scores will be forbidden from certain jobs and from applying to better schools.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Subway riders each with a social credit score2.

A 21-year-old Italian woman was found to have been bleeding intermittently from her face and palms for three years, according to a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Episodes seemed to be triggered without warning, although stress would often intensify the bleeding.  She was eventually diagnosed with blood sweating, or hematohidrosis. This condition causes blood to seep out of unbroken skin like normal perspiration.It's most common on the face, ears, nose and eyes and is often associated with fear and emotional stress, according to the National Institutes of Health Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, Time reported. The woman was treated with a beta blocker  propranolol  normally used to regulate blood pressure and heart rate.

      <title>Ovarian cancer found to originate in the fallopian tubes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONEA preliminary study of ovarian cancer suggests that its roots may lie in the fallopian tubes  a finding that could provide new insight in treating the deadly disease.Science Daily reports that ovarian cancer is the fifth largest cause of cancer deaths in women, as it is often detected late, or is already widespread at the time of diagnosis.Scientists from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston examined cell samples from women with ovarian tumors and those with cancer risk factors. The analysis revealed that all the women had mutations affecting the cancer-guarding p53 gene, and had lost chromosomes containing one or both BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor-suppressing genes.They tracked the source of the mutations to the fallopian tubes, where the cancer developed and eventually migrated to the ovaries over a 6.5-year period. Once in the ovaries, the cancer progressed more rapidly, metastasizing within two years.The team’s findings will need to be further validated by additional studies, but the results provide a glimmer of hope.With such a large window from fallopian tube to ovarian cancer, scientists believe new methods should be developed to detect and treat the cancer while it’s still localized in the tubes.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The goal of the program is to "forge a public opinion environment where keeping trust is glorious. It will strengthen sincerity in government affairs, commercial sincerity, social sincerity and the construction of judicial credibility," according to the Chinese government, Wired reported. Participation currently remains voluntary, but by 2020, it will be mandatory. The Chinese Communist Party has given out eight licenses to private companies to develop systems and algorithms for a social credit score system. The two biggest projects are run by China Rapid Finance and Sesame Credit. Sesame Credit, for example, gives individuals a score between 350 and 950 points based on a private algorithm calculated from five factors: credit history, contract obligation fulfillment, personal characteristics, behavior and preferences and interpersonal relationships.Once the system becomes mandatory, people with low scores could be punished with slower internet speeds, be denied access to certain restaurants, night clubs or golf courses and restricted from traveling. Scores will also affect an individual's rental applications, ability to secure insurance or a loan, as well as social security benefits.

Episodes seemed to be triggered without warning, although stress would often intensify the bleeding.  She was eventually diagnosed with blood sweating, or hematohidrosis. This condition causes blood to seep out of unbroken skin like normal perspiration.It's most common on the face, ears, nose and eyes and is often associated with fear and emotional stress, according to the National Institutes of Health Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, Time reported.

      <title>Ovarian cancer found to originate in the fallopian tubes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONEA preliminary study of ovarian cancer suggests that its roots may lie in the fallopian tubes  a finding that could provide new insight in treating the deadly disease.Science Daily reports that ovarian cancer is the fifth largest cause of cancer deaths in women, as it is often detected late, or is already widespread at the time of diagnosis.Scientists from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston examined cell samples from women with ovarian tumors and those with cancer risk factors. The analysis revealed that all the women had mutations affecting the cancer-guarding p53 gene, and had lost chromosomes containing one or both BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor-suppressing genes.They tracked the source of the mutations to the fallopian tubes, where the cancer developed and eventually migrated to the ovaries over a 6.5-year period. Once in the ovaries, the cancer progressed more rapidly, metastasizing within two years.The team’s findings will need to be further validated by additional studies, but the results provide a glimmer of hope.With such a large window from fallopian tube to ovarian cancer, scientists believe new methods should be developed to detect and treat the cancer while it’s still localized in the tubes.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The RS-28 Sarmat, or Satan-2, weighs over 100 metric tonnes, with Russian state-linked media claiming it has a 10,000-km range, according to the Independent.Moscow says the Satan-2 is capable of destroying an area the size of Texas.The RS-28 Sarmat is equipped with multiple hypersonic warheads  MIRVs  to help it evade missile defense systems. The Russian government says the new missile can carry a payload of up to 15 warheads. The first test-launches are slated to be held at the Plesetsk testing ground in western Russia by the end of the year.   Russia is planning for the RS-28 to enter service by the start of the next decade as a part of its ongoing push to modernize its nuclear arsenal. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. An RS-28 Sarmat launching2.

The goal of the program is to "forge a public opinion environment where keeping trust is glorious. It will strengthen sincerity in government affairs, commercial sincerity, social sincerity and the construction of judicial credibility," according to the Chinese government, Wired reported. Participation currently remains voluntary, but by 2020, it will be mandatory. The Chinese Communist Party has given out eight licenses to private companies to develop systems and algorithms for a social credit score system. The two biggest projects are run by China Rapid Finance and Sesame Credit. Sesame Credit, for example, gives individuals a score between 350 and 950 points based on a private algorithm calculated from five factors: credit history, contract obligation fulfillment, personal characteristics, behavior and preferences and interpersonal relationships.Once the system becomes mandatory, people with low scores could be punished with slower internet speeds, be denied access to certain restaurants, night clubs or golf courses and restricted from traveling. Scores will also affect an individual's rental applications, ability to secure insurance or a loan, as well as social security benefits. Citizens with low scores will be forbidden from certain jobs and from applying to better schools.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Subway riders each with a social credit score2.

The goal of the program is to "forge a public opinion environment where keeping trust is glorious. It will strengthen sincerity in government affairs, commercial sincerity, social sincerity and the construction of judicial credibility," according to the Chinese government, Wired reported. Participation currently remains voluntary, but by 2020, it will be mandatory. The Chinese Communist Party has given out eight licenses to private companies to develop systems and algorithms for a social credit score system. The two biggest projects are run by China Rapid Finance and Sesame Credit. Sesame Credit, for example, gives individuals a score between 350 and 950 points based on a private algorithm calculated from five factors: credit history, contract obligation fulfillment, personal characteristics, behavior and preferences and interpersonal relationships.Once the system becomes mandatory, people with low scores could be punished with slower internet speeds, be denied access to certain restaurants, night clubs or golf courses and restricted from traveling. Scores will also affect an individual's rental applications, ability to secure insurance or a loan, as well as social security benefits.

The goal of the program is to "forge a public opinion environment where keeping trust is glorious. It will strengthen sincerity in government affairs, commercial sincerity, social sincerity and the construction of judicial credibility," according to the Chinese government, Wired reported. Participation currently remains voluntary, but by 2020, it will be mandatory. The Chinese Communist Party has given out eight licenses to private companies to develop systems and algorithms for a social credit score system. The two biggest projects are run by China Rapid Finance and Sesame Credit. Sesame Credit, for example, gives individuals a score between 350 and 950 points based on a private algorithm calculated from five factors: credit history, contract obligation fulfillment, personal characteristics, behavior and preferences and interpersonal relationships.Once the system becomes mandatory, people with low scores could be punished with slower internet speeds, be denied access to certain restaurants, night clubs or golf courses and restricted from traveling. Scores will also affect an individual's rental applications, ability to secure insurance or a loan, as well as social security benefits.

It's also difficult to engineer antibodies that can be effective against the multiple strains of HIV, which frequently mutate.Using a synthetic chemistry method, scientists have now designed a vaccine combining a gp120 fragment and a sugar molecule, and tested it on HIV-infected rabbits.The vaccine prompted the rabbits' immune systems to produce antibodies that physically bound to gp120 found in four dominant HIV strains.It takes roughly two years to build immunity against HIV, so despite sticking to the virus, the antibodies weren't able to prevent further infection.But the vaccine's ability to induce a strong immune response in a short amount of time is encouraging, and researchers believe further studies can produce a vaccine that can ultimately neutralize the deadly virus.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Andrew Meas was paralyzed from the chest down after his spine was broken at the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae in a accident nearly 10 years ago, Newsweek reported. Meas has spent four years in physical rehabilitation, but has also been receiving an experimental treatment called spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) from a research team at the University of Louisville, Quartz reported.    The device sends electrical signals to motor neurons telling them to move. Meas was one of four patients to receive the implant. At the end of the study, Meas was able to move his legs, stand on both feet or one foot entirely on his own. The other three patients did regain some leg movement, but not to the degree Meas experienced.

It's also difficult to engineer antibodies that can be effective against the multiple strains of HIV, which frequently mutate.Using a synthetic chemistry method, scientists have now designed a vaccine combining a gp120 fragment and a sugar molecule, and tested it on HIV-infected rabbits.The vaccine prompted the rabbits' immune systems to produce antibodies that physically bound to gp120 found in four dominant HIV strains.It takes roughly two years to build immunity against HIV, so despite sticking to the virus, the antibodies weren't able to prevent further infection.But the vaccine's ability to induce a strong immune response in a short amount of time is encouraging, and researchers believe further studies can produce a vaccine that can ultimately neutralize the deadly virus.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It cannot be scrubbed off, and can remain on a person's clothes and skin for months.""The spray not only helps identify suspects, but also serves to effectively link them to their specific crime."SOURCES: Evening Standard, Huddersfield Daily Examiner, SelectaDNA, Pontefract and Castleford Expresshttps://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/police-trial-chemical-spray-in-bid-to-clamp-down-on-surge-of-mopedenabled-crime-in-london-a3668081.htmlhttp://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/new-dna-spray-help-police-13813800https://www.selectadna.co.uk/news/uk-police-first-dna-spray-secures-arrest-of-scrambler-bike-criminalshttp://www.pontefractandcastlefordexpress.co.uk/news/teen-sentenced-following-police-s-first-use-of-dna-tagging-spray-1-8823733***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

The program's budget for the mission is relatively small, at only 93 million dollars.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft components2.
