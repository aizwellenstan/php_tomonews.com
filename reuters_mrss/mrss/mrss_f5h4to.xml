      <title><![CDATA[New Ebola suit made by Johns Hopkins team offers more protection and comfort in hot, humid climates]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[A team at John Hopkins University has developed a protective suit for Ebola workers that is more comfortable and offers more protection than existing “moon suits.”The new anti-Ebola suit has a large integrated plastic shield that stretches around the face, providing a wide viewing area.It uses a belt-worn battery pack, which can be recharged with a cellphone charger, that blows dry and filtered air into the hood.The designers of the new suit put a person wearing the new Ebola suit and another person wearing the standard Ebola suit in a room with a temperatures of 98 degrees Fahrenheit and 85 percent humidity. The new suit allowed the wearer to breathe normally, while person in the old suit felt unwell within minutes.A breakaway zipper allows the wearer to open the suit from the back. The wearer then needs to stick the wrist tabs on the floor or stand on it to get out of the entire suit by standing up straight. This ensures the wearer would not make any contact with the outer layer of the suit.The new suit was one of three solutions for Ebola workers that will share a $1.7 million prize in a competition held by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The other two were an antiseptic gel that protects the skin and an antimicrobial anti-contamination spray.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NASA’s Dawn spacecraft is currently on its way to the asteroid belt where it will eventually meet with Ceres, its largest celestial body. The dwarf planet has an average diameter of about 950 km (590 miles).Dawn captured the first image of Ceres on December 1. At just 9 pixels in width, the tiny photo was taken at a distance of about 1.2 million kilometers (740,000 miles), roughly three times the distance between Earth and the moon.The spacecraft is expected to deliver much high-resolution images in early 2015, when it’s significantly closer to Ceres.The $466 million Dawn mission launched by NASA in September 2007 aims to study not only the dwarf planet, but also protoplanet Vesta.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Nine years and 3 billion miles after it was launched into space, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft has awoken from hibernation and is preparing to travel to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.The New Horizons spacecraft, which weighs about half a ton, is about the size and shape of a baby grand piano.According to NASA’s New Horizons website, the spacecraft has gone into hibernation 18 times, Ars Technica reported, for a total of 1,873 days, since its launch in January 2006 in order to minimize wear on its components and reduce the risk of system failures.It is expected to make its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015. It will then explore the Kuiper Belt from 2016 to 2020.The mission’s objectives include mapping the surface composition and temperatures of Pluto and Kuiper Belt objects, as well as their geology and morphology.New Horizons is expected to be 100 astronomical units away from the Sun by 2038 and will be able to send data about the outer heliosphere if it is still operational by then, CNET reported.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Unveiled in Zikhron Ya’akov, Israel, the eTree harnesses solar power to charge mobile devices, cool water, and provide free WIFI for communities.The tree’s form is inspired by the Acacia tree, with seven solar panels branching out from the structure’s brown metal trunk. The panels can generate as much as 1.4 kilowatts of power, or enough to run 35 laptops.The structure is also built with a rechargeable battery that stores power for cloudy days and lights up LEDs at night. Its developer, Sologic, intends to equip future eTrees with technology that condenses water from from air, and built-in cameras that connect eTree communities around the world.The $100,000 trees would not replace solar panels but may catch on as a fun park fixture worldwide.“We're in the middle of the desert and we're able to create everything we need just from the solar system,” Sologic CEO Michael Lasry said in an NPR report.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Ambulance drone: A flying defibrillator that can save hundreds of people having heart attack]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dubbing it ‘ambulance drone’, a student at a Dutch university has developed a flying defibrillator that can respond within minutes after a heart attack sets in.“Around 800,000 people suffer a cardiac arrest in the European Union every year and only 8 per cent survive,” said Belgian-national Alec Momont, the developer of the device. “The main reason for this is the relatively long response time of emergency services of about 10 minutes, while brain death and fatalities occur within four to six minutes.”The ambulance drone is equipped with a camera and a GPS navigation system. Powered by six propellers, the the drone can reach a maximum speed of 100 kilometres per hour.When someone suffers a heart attack, bystanders can call an emergency hotline and an ambulance drone is next dispatched.Using a camera mounted on the drone, a staffer can then instruct bystanders to attach the defibrillator to the patient.The drone can transport the device to someone in need inside a 12 km2  zone within one minute, significantly increasing the survival rate of patients.Apart from the defibrillator, the developer hopes that the drone will be able to carry other medical supplies such as oxygen masks and insulin injections.Momont aims to create an ambulance drone network in the Netherlands within the next five years. Each drone costs around €15,000, but Momont does not believe price will be an issue. “I have calculated these at approximately €15,000 per drone, which is clearly a reasonable amount if you consider the number of lives that could be saved,” Momont said.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[It might sound like something out a sci-fi film, but the day could soon arrive when oxygen can be obtained by just a few grains of a newly developed material.Scientists in Denmark announced they have developed a substance that absorbs, stores and releases huge amounts of oxygen.The substance is so effective that just a few grains are capable of storing enough oxygen for a single human breath while a bucket full of the new material could capture an entire room of O2.With the new material there are hopes those requiring medical oxygen might soon be freed from carrying bulky tanks, while SCUBA divers might also be able to use the material to absorb oxygen from water, allowing them to stay submerged for significantly longer.The substance was developed by tinkering with the molecular structure of cobalt, a chemical element that when found in meteoric iron, resembles a silver-gray metal.  Scientists are hailing the breakthrough, but it could be many years before viable commercial uses of the new substance become available.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Carbon capture technology improves oil extraction]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[A joint venture between NRG Energy and JX Nippon Oil & Gas aims to use carbon dioxide extracted from power plants for improved crude oil recovery.The carbon capture technology taps into flue gases released from NRG’s WA Parish coal plant near Houston. Flue gas, which consists of carbon dioxide and a mix of other gases, is pumped into a capture system, where CO2 is pulled out with a solvent that forms a temporary bond with CO2. The gas is then released from the solvent with a slight reheating.The purified CO2 is pumped deep into an oil field near Victoria, Texas where it binds with crude oil and increases the viscosity of the oil, making it easier to pump the oil out of the ground. The mixture is next pumped up to the surface and separated. CO2 is sent back into the extraction loop to pump out more oil.“Any solution that doesn't take carbon from the air is, in principle, not sustainable,” physicist Peter Eisenberger of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, who is developing a method to extract CO2 from the sky, said in a Yale Environment 360 Report.Over the next several decades, oil recovery from aging fields is expected to consume around 33 billion metric tons of CO2 in total, according to an estimate conducted by John Thompson, director of the Fossil Fuel Transition Project for the non-profit Clean Air Task Force.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A collaboration between Japan’s Nagasaki University and Eiken Chemical has developed a test that can detect an Ebola infection in 30 minutes. After blood is taken from a patient, RNA is extracted from the sample and synthesised into DNA, which is mixed with Ebola-binding primers and other reagents in a technique developed by Eiken known as reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification, or RT-LAMP. The mixture is heated to 60 to 65 degrees Celsius. Any genetic material from the Ebola virus in the sample is amplified during the reaction, causing the reagent to become cloudy, providing a visual confirmation of an Ebola reaction.Currently, polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is the established method for detecting an Ebola infection. This method requires more specialized lab equipment and requires one to two hours for the testing to be completed.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Scientists new interpretation of Egyptian painting sheds new light on how pyramids were built]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[A new interpretation of a painting inside an Egyptian tomb has shed new light on how ancient Egyptians moved heavy stones to build the pyramids.Stones used to create the Egyptian pyramids weighed on average about 2.5 tonnes each. Research by scientists at the University of Amsterdam shows workers moved the stones on wooden sleds with upturned edges at the front. However, the friction of the wood against dry sand in the desert would have caused significant drag, creating a sand berm in front of the sled as it moved forward. Workers would then need to clear the built up sand before the sled could be moved again.A new interpretation of an ancient Egyptian painting shows workers may have instead poured water onto the sand in front of sleds. Sand with just the right amount of dampness causes microdroplets of water to bind to the grains of sand, creating a form across the grains and making the sand stiffer, significantly reducing friction and drag as the sled was moved forward. This meant less manpower was needed to move the sleds forward.Artwork within the tomb of Djehutihotep, which was discovered in the Victorian Era, depicts a scene of slaves hauling a colossal statue of the Middle Kingdom ruler. In the painting, a man standing at the front of the sled is portrayed pouring liquid into the sand. Scientists say this discovery could even have implications for how modern society can efficiently transport everything, including sand, cement and flour.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A team at the University of Sydney developed a robotic herder to move cows from the pasture to the dairy.In a recent trial, researchers found that the cows readily accepted the presence of the herding robot.  Named Rover by its creators, the robot matches the herd's pace which keeps the cows calm and prevents them from sustaining injuries. The robot is equipped with a Velodyne 3D LiDAR, which sends out lasers to detect and track the movement of cows. A GPS system onboard Rover also tracks the motion of the vehicle over rough terrain. Data collected from these sensors produce a 3D reconstruction of the herd and the robot's movement on the pasture. The tested prototype requires human control, but the final version of the robot is expected to be fully automated. Researchers are also looking to equip Rover to collect soil quality data and check for damaged fences."When we have discussed this concept with farmers they have been extremely excited and we have had a flurry of calls and emails asking how they can get hold of one," Dr Kendra Kerrisk, dairy researcher and associate professor at the University of Sydney, said in a BBC report.]]></description>

Gardiner’s frogs are found in the rainforests of the Seychelles, a series of 115 small islands in the Indian Ocean. They grow to a maximum of just 11 millimeters and are among the tiniest in the world. This species of frog does not possess a middle ear with an eardrum and was thus thought to be deaf.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A council in London is trying out a novel way to reduce the expense of emptying streetside litter bins.Merton in south west London is trialling the Big Belly bin, which works using solar power generated by solar panels fitted to the top.The panels generate enough energy to run a trash compactor that crush the refuse when the bin becomes full.The big belly needs just eight hours of sunlight per month and can collect the same amount of trash as up to eight conventional bins.The manufacturer of the bins says they can reduce the number of waste collections needed by up to 86 percent. The bins can also reduce the number of vehicle trips required and fuel used by trash collectors.Each compactor comes equipped with an electronic monitoring system.When it is almost full the bin sends a message to a smartphone indicating that it is ready to be emptied.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[New icebreaker ship will cut through ice sideways]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[Finland's Arctech Helsinki Shipyard is taking a different approach with its new icebreaker, ice-breaking rescue vessel NB 508. Also known as the Baltika, the vessel is being built for Russia's Ministry of Transport for use in the Gulf of Finland, near St. Petersburg. At 76 metres long and 20 metres wide, it features an asymmetric hull, which it will use to cut through ice obliquely, potentially doubling the size of the channels it clears compared with traditional icebreakers, which travel through ice in a straight path. Three engine pods mounted on the hull can rotate to deliver propulsion at any angle.The Baltika is expected to be in the water by November and will be cutting ice by the spring thaw. It will also be used in search and rescue and oil spill cleanup operations, which it can perform even in heavy seas. The asymmetric hull will make the vessel difficult to steer at sea, causing it to pitch and roll in an irregular fashion, so its pilots will require special training.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Scientists created the first telescopic contact lens that allows users to zoom in their vision almost three times. The telescopic contact lens has two regions. The centre allows light to pass straight through, which provides normal vision. The edge acts as a telescope and magnifies the light using a patterned aluminum mirror. The image is magnified 2.8 times to the edge of the retina at the back of the eyeballs.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A French company developed a skin patch that could help children who have peanut allergy.The skin patch contains a small dose of peanut protein which will be absorbed into the human body once applied to the skin. This would solicit the immune system's reaction, known as Epicutaneous Immunotherapy. Over time, as more and more peanut protein is introduced into the body, desensitization will make the immune system used to the allergen.It was reported that approximately 20 percent of patients between the ages of 5 to 17 were able to consume ten times the amount of peanut protein after wearing the patch for about 12 months.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ikea has teamed up with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to create more durable shelters for refugees.The structures consist of four walls and are roughly twice the size of current temporary dwellings. Measuring about 17.5 square metres they are able to comfortably fit five people. Built around a simple framework of poles and connectors and covered in insulated plastic, the shelter takes roughly four hours to build, but is able to last almost three years, even in adverse weather.The siding covering the shelters is a material called Rhulite that lets in light during the day, but keeps it from casting shadows outside during the night, giving those inside more privacy. The material also reflects sunlight during the day while retaining heat in the evening.Ikea and the UNHCR are also hoping to improve the design with netting that will serve as a solar panel to charge a battery that can provide power for lighting.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Three-year-old Grayson Clamp has been given the gift of hearing with a revolutionary auditory brainstem implant.The implant is an electronic device that stimulates nerves in the brain, allowing the child to process sound.Grayson was born without the cochlear nerves that convey auditory information to the brain. Without these nerves a more common cochlear ear implant was not an option.The auditory brainstem implant is surgically inserted into the brain near the ear. A microphone device near the ear receives sound and this signal is passed through the implant to a microchip at the brainstem which conveys the information directly to the brain, bypassing the cochlear nerves altogether.This video shows how the auditory brainstem works.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A regenerated kidney, which was grown in a laboratory has been transplanted into a living animal and has successfully produced urine, scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston announced on Sunday. The scientists started with the kidneys of recently deceased rats and used detergent to wash away the old cells leaving behind an underlying scaffold of connective tissues. They then regenerated the organ by seeding the scaffold with human umbilical-vein cells to line the blood vessels, and kidney cells from newborn rats to produce other tissues that make up the organ. The seeded scaffold was then put into an organ bioreactor to grow until it is ready for transplantation. However once transplanted into rats, the regenerated kidney was only able to produce one third as much as urine as normal kidneys, and cleared creatinine 36 times slower than normal.This method was developed by organ-regeneration specialist Harald Ott in 2008. Ott has used the technique to grow hearts and lungs since then. The team is now testing the same technique using pig and human kidneys.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Fusion rocket engines could take a manned crew to Mars in 30 to 90 days, NASA-funded scientists at the University of Washington say.The scientists are building a fusion-driven rocket system that pulses at a rate of one blast per minute, causing exhaust to exit the divergent magnetic nozzle at 30 km per second. Solar energy will provide electricity needed to charge capacitors that power the fusion rocket's magnets. For each pulse of the rocket engine, powerful magnets crush a series of lithium metal rings around a ball of tritium-deuterium plasma. An exothermic reaction occurs, providing thrust.The fusion rocket engine will only be active for 10 percent of the voyage, to speed the spaceship away from Earth, and to slow the spaceship down upon arrival near Mars. Unlike a conventional chemical rocket, the fusion rocket's lithium fuel takes up only 50 percent of its mass, compared to 98 percent for a liquid fuel Saturn V rocket.The fusion rocket should also be more cost effective than a chemical rocket, whose primary cost is transporting fuel to space.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Pilotless drone aircraft will be used to track wildlife and fight poachers in wildlife reserves around the world. Park rangers in Kenya plan to introduce drones to help monitor endangered animals over vast expanses of park land.The drones will be day and night capable and will help rangers combat poaching. Conservationists will also be able to tag animals with RFID chips, which communicate by radio with drones orbiting overhead.By constantly monitoring the animals' whereabouts, scientists hope the drones will increase their understanding of animal behavior.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Deep sea mining: an explainer]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[The British government has voiced its support for the deep sea mining industry following the awarding of exploration rights to a British subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, UK Seabed Resources. Prime Minister David Cameron has said the sector could be worth 40 billion pounds to the British economy over the next 30 years.The exploration license covers a 58,000 sq km patch of seabed between Hawaii and Mexico.To mine the seabed, a support vessel arrives at the site and launches a mining vehicle.The subsea mining tool - or crawler - roves the seabed, slicing clumps of mineral-rich rock called 'polymetallic nodules' from the crust.For smooth passage in the high-pressure environment, the hose is floated above the crawler and weighted beneath the ship.The crawler crushes the rocks, and a mixture of gravel and seawater is pumped to the surface vessel via an umbilical hose.Working at depths of up to 4 km, the crawler is specially designed to withstand corrosion and extreme pressure.The nodules are packed with many rare earth elements and valuable metals, including cobalt, manganese, nickel, copper and aluminium.Although costly and technically complex, such projects could be extremely profitable.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Archaeologists have discovered at least 35 ancient pyramids and graves thought to be about 2,000 years old at a site called Sedeinga in Sudan. The dense concentration is surprising to researchers, who in 2011 found 13 pyramids clustered closely together in a 5,381 square feet area, slightly larger than an NBA basketball court. They date back around 2,000 years to a time when the kingdom of Kush flourished in Sudan. Kush shared a border with Egypt and was influenced by Egyptian funerary architecture. The structure of the pyramids are designed with a circle built inside them and cross-braces connecting the circle to the corners of the pyramid. There is only one pyramid outside of Sedeinga known to have been built in the same style. The largest pyramid found is seven meters wide at its base, while the smallest is only 750 millimeters long.

      <description><![CDATA[Signs of life have been detected in waters from a subglacial Lake Whillans half a mile beneath the surface of Antarctic. On Jan. 28, scientists retrieved a baseball bat-sized gray plastic vessel filled with water from Lake Whillans. The vessel was sent into a cargo container laboratory on skis, where some of the water was poured into bottles that contain a growth medium to culture bacteria in the water. When the lake water was viewed under a microscope, it was observed that tiny cells in the water glowed green in response to DNA-sensitive dye. Scientists said that despite being sealed beneath 2,600 feet of ice, it is likely microbes in the lake obtained energy by consuming oxygen released from water melting off the ice sheet in the lake to metabolize iron and sulfur.  US scientists reported on Jan. 27 that they had drilled through 2,600 feet of ice to reach Lake Whillans, a subglacial lake buried beneath the Antarctic ice sheet. Scientists with the Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) project, which is funded by the US National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs, began drilling Jan. 21.One of the primary purposes of the WISSARD project is to look for signs of life in the lake, which, if present, would most likely be in the form of microorganisms adapted to live in the extreme cold, dark environment of a subglacial lake.The American project marks the third attempt to drill into a subglacial lake in Antarctica within the past year. Russia successfully drilled into Lake Vostok last year. A British attempt to drill into Lake Ellsworth failed last month.

      <description><![CDATA[Scientists in Scotland have come up with a novel geoengineering solution to combat global warming - using dust from an asteroid to reflect the sun's rays. The plan by boffins at the University of Strathclyde would involve using an electromagnet "mass driver" to alter the orbit of the asteroid 1036 Ganymed and positioning it at Lagrange point L1, where the gravitational pull of the Earth and Sun cancel out. Creating a dust cloud made from the asteroid anchored by the rock would then block approximately 6.58 percent of solar radiation from reaching the Earth, according to the plan.]]></description>

This year it shrank by 27,000 square miles from its record 2007 low to 1.5 million square miles, the lowest measurement since 1975. Apart from the risk of rising sea levels, the melting ice increases the possibility of releasing 4 billion metric tons of methane hydrate trapped underneath the Arctic ice sheet into the atmosphere.]]></description>

Three minimal invasive catheter methods to retrieve clots have been developed. Coiling uses a coilable microwire to wrap around the clot and a balloon to open up the artery so that the clot can be removed. Vacuuming uses a separator attached to a suction device to penetrate the clot and suck it out. The titanium net is attached to a microwire and allows blood cells to pass while retrieving the clot]]></description>

When the pitcher releases the ball, the stitching on the leather causes pressure on one side of the ball to be greater than on the other side. This imbalance of force, called the Magnus force, makes the ball move faster on one side than the the other, resulting in a curved trajectory. This animation explains what makes a curveball curve.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[CERN Large Hadron Collider: How it works]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[Based on tests conducted at the Large Hadron Collider on the French-Swiss border, scientists at the CERN research center believe they have found the so-called "God Particle," the Higgs boson, so named because it gives other subatomic particle their mass. The Higgs boson has been theorized for decades but never directly observed. Confirmation of its existence would place it alongside other subatomic particles to have been observed within the Standard Model of particle physics. This animation explains how the Large Hadron Collider works. The existence of the Higgs boson was confirmed after analyzing data from the Large Hadron Collider, which is part of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[British researchers are developing an artificial pancreas that would automatically control levels of glucose in the bloodstream, obviating the need for diabetics to constantly monitor and regulate their blood sugar levels during the day and reducing the risk of dangerous blood sugar levels developing while diabetics are sleeping. The artificial pancreas is being developed by principal research associate Roman Hovorka and a team at the University of Cambridge. It would not replace the pancreas but would consist of an externally worn sensor that would monitor glucose levels and an external pump that would use a computer algorithm to calculate doses of insulin and glucose and dispense them based on changes in glucose levels.

Cold water is pumped into the reservoir, where it is heated. Pressure pushes heated water up to the surface. This hot water heats a secondary fluid via a heat exchanger. Steam from the secondary fluid spins a turbine to generate electricity. Sources: Economist]]></description>

At a depth of 1,000 meters, it dissolves into the water. On the seafloor at 3,000 meters, where carbon dioxide becomes dense enough not to rise, it forms a “carbon dioxide lake.” Sources: Science Daily, National Geographic]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NASA’s Kepler space telescope has discovered a planet in a habitable zone around a star with similar conditions to our own Sun. Kepler 22b’s year is 290 days long and scientsts estimate the surface temperature is around 72 degrees, although they are not sure if the planet is made up of water, gas or rock. Kepler 22-b lies about 600 light-years away from earth and is about 2.4 times the size of Earth.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Arctic Ozone loss this year formed an "ozone hole" similar to the one in the Antarctic for the first time, scientists report. The destruction of ozone was more pronounced due to an unusually long period of cold weather which speeds up the reaction between chlorofluorocarbons and atmospheric ozone.

      <description><![CDATA[The world’s top tennis player, Novak Djokovic, heads to Flushing Meadows for the US Open this week. Despite his recent dominance, he has complained of a shoulder injury over the past weeks. Shoulder injuries are common in tennis because the sport involves consistent rotation of the arm. This makes the bursa and rotator cuff rub against the shoulder bone, causing inflammation and pain. Source: WebMD, Orthoinfo, Orthogate]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[How hurricanes form]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[Hurricanes form when warm humid air rises from the ocean. Convergent winds force the warm air into the atmosphere, where it releases latent heat as it condenses into clouds and rain. The exchange of the heat from the surface creates a pattern of wind that spirals up around the eye of the storm, and the hurricane grows, powered by the ocean’s heat and evaporating water.

      <description><![CDATA[In a paper published on Wednesday in Nature, scientists proposed that two moons were formed billions of years ago when a Mars-sized planet slammed into the Earth  our Moon and a tiny Trojan moon that inhabited what’s known as a Lagrange point 60 degrees in front of or behind the Moon. Eventually the Sun’s gravity caused both moons to collide, with the tiny moon fragmenting across the far side of our Moon. Source: Nature]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A nuclear power plant creates energy that turns water into steam. The steam turns a turbine that is connected to a generator that produces electricity. Meanwhile, the steam is converted back to water and returned to the reactor core. Inside the reactor core are fuel rod contains pellets of uranium dioxide. Nuclear fission occurs inside the fuel rods, releasing thermal energy that turns the water into steam. To prevent overheating, control rods are inserted into the reactor core.]]></description>
