Up to 60 percent of the particles reach above the toilet seat and these droplets can remain airborne for up to a minute, the researchers found.The virus could then infect others who inhale the aerosols or come into contact with infected surfaces, such as by touching door handles or toilet seats where the droplets have landed.In the journal the researchers noted that more attention needs to be paid to toilets as potential sources of infection and even toilet design, writing, "According to the characteristics of fecal-oral transmission, there will be a large amount of viruses within a toilet when a confirmed case uses it. Thus, toilets should be regarded as one of the infection sources."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Coronavirus present in the gut after symptoms disappear2.

A study published in May in the Lancet found virus particles in the feces of COVID-19 patients nearly five weeks after the patients had tested negative.""Now, researchers from Yangzhou University have used computer simulations to show that water flushed in an uncovered toilet can eject infected aerosol droplets up to three feet, or one meter, in the air. Some stay in the toilet, but up to 60 percent of the particles reach above the toilet seat.

Evidence suggests that mosasaurus gave birth to live young. However, the egg could have hatched right after being laid.

According to a report published in Cell Reports, experts from the University of Pittsburgh successfully developed and transplanted functioning human mini-livers into rats.Scientists created the mini livers by using human skin cells and then reverting them into a stem cell state. These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells and other types of cells can derive from them.They then used chemicals and hormones to induce differentiation. This pushed the induced pluripotent stem cells into becoming liver cells. The newly created liver cells were then seeded on mini-liver bioreactors.The lab-grown livers were then transplanted into five immunosuppressed mice or mice whose immune system would be less likely to reject the organ. Four days after the transplant, the mice were dissected in order to examine how well the  implanted organ functioned.After dissecting the rats, researchers found all five rats had blood circulation issues around the graft of the mini-liver. However, the rats had human liver proteins in their blood serum indicating that the livers were working properly.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Human liver in a laboratory rat2.

Paleontologists at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology discovered they had mistakenly identified a fossil as the bone of an ancient flying reptile called pterosaur, but it actually belonged to a rare dinosaur called elaphrosaur. This is the first elaphrosaur found in Australia.Citing Stephen Poropat, the lead author of the study, The Guardian reports that only three other elaphrosaurs species have been found in Tanzania, China and Argentina.The elaphrosaur was part of the theropod family, which includes predators like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and velociraptors.

However, the bat virus does not have the spike protein parts used by SARS-CoV-2 for infecting humans.Yet another close relative, a clade of SARS-like pangolin virus from China, has receptor-binding domains that closely match the corresponding parts of the novel coronavirus.The bat and pangolin viruses likely recombined to form SARS-CoV-2. Recombining may occur when two similar viruses infect the same cell. When this happens, molecules that made up the distinct viruses are reshuffled into a new pathogen.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

However, the bat virus does not have the spike protein parts used by SARS-CoV-2 for infecting humans.""Yet another close relative, a clade of SARS-like pangolin virus from China, has receptor-binding domains that closely match the corresponding parts of the novel coronavirus.""The bat and pangolin viruses likely recombined to form SARS-CoV-2. Recombining may occur when two similar viruses infect the same cell. When this happens, molecules that made up the distinct viruses are reshuffled into a new pathogen."SOURCES: Science Advances, Duke Universityhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/28/sciadv.abb9153https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200529161221.htm***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

Puhahonu means "turtle surfacing for air" in Hawaiin. Writing in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, scientists say the research vessel Falkor charted the ocean with sonar and gravity mapping technology.According to the survey, Puhahonu is 90 km wide and 275 km long, or twice the size of Mauna Loa, formerly the world's largest known volcano.Scientists say the shield volcano's size was probably the result of abundant magma flowing from a very hot spot in the mantle. The temperature of the magma that created the Puhahonu is suggested by the forsterite content that is the highest among Hawaii's volcanoes. According to the study, Puhahonu is so massive that the Earth's crust and mantle buckled under its weight, which sank the bulk of the volcano under the sea.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This is the speed at which marine animals would have to move in order to live in waters with certain temperatures as different ocean layers become warmer.Scientists then used climate models to estimate climate velocity rates today in three different scenarios: One scenario is where greenhouse gas emissions start falling from now; another is in which emissions would begin to fall in the middle of this century; and the final scenario is one where emissions would continue to rise up to 2100.However, even in the scenario where emissions would start declining now, climate velocity in the ocean's layer that covers from 200 meters deep up to 1 kilometer down  what is known as the mesopelagic layer  would change from about 6 kilometers per decade to 50 kilometers by mid-century.

This is the speed at which marine animals would have to move in order to live in waters with certain temperatures as different ocean layers become warmer.""Scientists then used climate models to estimate climate velocity rates today in three different scenarios: One scenario is where greenhouse gas emissions start falling from now; another is in which emissions would begin to fall in the middle of this century; and the final scenario is one where emissions would continue to rise up to 2100.""However, even in the scenario where emissions would start declining now, climate velocity in the ocean's layer that covers from 200 meters deep up to 1 kilometer down  what is known as the mesopelagic layer  would change from about 6 kilometers per decade to 50 kilometers by mid-century. Conversely, in the same period, climate velocity rate would halve on the ocean's surface level."SOURCES: Nature Climate Change, Hokkaido University, The Guardianhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0773-5https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/there-is-no-escaping-from-climate-change-even-in-the-deep-sea/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/climate-change-in-deep-oceans-could-be-seven-times-faster-by-middle-of-century-report-says***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

It is one of only a handful among the 4,000 exoplanets to have been detected that is similar to Earth in both size and orbit.According to their research, which was published on May 7 in The Astronomical Journal, the world is four times the mass of Earth.It orbits a dim dwarf star that is only 10 percent the mass of our Sun. This star is so small that the researchers could not determine if it is a low-mass star or a kind of failed star called a brown dwarf.The newly discovered orbits at a distance between Venus and Earth from its parent star. But because its star's mass is so small, a year on this world lasts 617 days.To find the planet, the researchers used a method called gravitational microlensing. "The combined gravity of the planet and its host star caused the light from a more distant background star to be magnified in a particular way. We used telescopes distributed around the world to measure the light-bending effect," University of Canterbury astronomer Antonio Herrera Martin, said in the news release."These experiments detect around 3,000 microlensing events each year, the majority of which are due to lensing by single stars," the paper's co-author Michael Albrow was quoted as saying in the news release. "Dr Herrera Martin first noticed that there was an unusual shape to the light output from this event, and undertook months of computational analysis that resulted in the conclusion that this event was due to a star with a low-mass planet."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANVOICEOVER:"COVID-19 is an airborne disease that spreads in tiny droplets that contain the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. When people inhale contaminated droplets, the virus enters into the nose and the throat.""COVID-19 infection usually begins in the nose and throat, because the mucous membranes of these sites contain epithelial cells that are rich in ACE2 cell surface receptors. The virus needs to exploit ACE2 to get into human cells.""The coronavirus's outer coating is covered in spike proteins that give the virus its crown-like appearance. The spike protein possesses receptor binding domains, or RBDs, that the virus uses to pry open receptors before penetrating the cellular membrane.""The ACE2 receptor normally regulates blood pressure. But the coronavirus's downward RBD can bind with this receptor and allow the virus to enter, and then hijack, the host cell.""Once the virus enters the human cell, its coating dissolves and frees viral RNA to hijack the host cell's apparatuses. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum produces viral RNA and proteins, while its Golgi body packages them into whole new viruses.""As the virus multiplies, the infected person may develop early symptoms, such as a sore throat and dry cough, while spreading plentiful amounts of the virus to others. Other symptoms for the first week of infection include fever; a loss of smell and taste; and muscle aches.""The lungs contain air sacs called alveoli that keep us alive by exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen. If the virus moves down the lungs, it attacks the alveoli, which are lined with vulnerable, ACE2 receptor-rich cells.""To fight off infections, white blood cells release cytokines to summon more immune cells. Pneumonic COVID-19 may trigger cytokine storm syndrome, a phenomenon where the body scrambles too many immune cells.""As the virus attacks the lungs, the cytokine storm floods the lungs with white blood cells that destroy both healthy and infected cells. This fills the air sacs with liquids, mucous and the detritus of dead cells.""Pneumonic COVID-19 disrupts the exchange of oxygen and damages the lungs extensively, which leads to dangerously low oxygen levels that may become fatal.""When the virus gets into the heart, it strikes blood vessel cells that are rich in ACE2 receptors. Clinical studies suggest the viral onslaught causes blood clots that obstruct the artilleries and trigger heart attacks.""Intestinal cells that are responsible for absorbing nutrition called enterocytes also express the RNA for ACE2 and a related enzyme that the virus also exploits, which makes the intestines vulnerable.""A clinical study from the Chinese city of Wuhan found more than a third of COVID-19 patients suffered neurological complications." "According to the neurological study, as many as 35 percent of patients had neurological complications including impaired cognition, stroke and muscle damage. Blood clots that travelled to the brain could be the cause of the strokes."SOURCES: National Library of Medicine, Lancet, JAMA Neurology, Nature, MIT, American Academy of Otolaryngology, Europe PMChttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15141377https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30628-0/fulltexthttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2764549https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0868-6https://news.mit.edu/2020/researchers-cells-targeted-covid-19-0422https://www.entnet.org/content/aao-hns-anosmia-hyposmia-and-dysgeusia-symptoms-coronavirus-diseasehttps://europepmc.org/article/med/32026671***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA study published in the journal Biology Letters has found that exposure to microplastics can disrupt a hermit crab's ability to choose a shell. Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing microplastics. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with no microplastics. After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell. Only nine of the crabs that had been exposed to microplastics moved into the new shells, compared to 21 from the control group.This suggests exposure to microplastics impairs the crabs' cognition, and that microplastics in general can have important effects on an animal's behavior.Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen's University Belfast, told the Guardian he was surprised by the results. "We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behavior, for example," he said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

New satellite images show Iceberg A-68 lost a 175 square km chunk of ice, which will likely be called Iceberg A-68c, between satellite passes on April 21 and April 22, according to images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission.Iceberg A-68 broke off from the Larsen Ice Shelf in July of 2017 and remained largely intact for three years as it drifted past the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea. Today it is around 5,000 square km, almost four times the size of Greater London. Currents in the Southern Ocean are now pushing the iceberg past the South Orkney Islands into increasingly warmer waters.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Location of Iceberg A-68 when Iceberg A-68c breaks off2.

Iceberg A-68 being pushed north by currents in the Southern OceanVOICEOVER (in English): "It looks like the beginning of the end for the world's largest iceberg." "New satellite images show Iceberg A-68 lost a 175 square km chunk of ice, which will likely be called Iceberg A-68c, between satellite passes on April 21 and April 22.""When it first calved from Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf, Iceberg A-68 was nearly 6,000 square km in size, according to images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission.""Today it is around 5,000 square km. That's almost four times the size of Greater London, or roughly half the size of the islands of Hawaii or Cyprus." "The giant chunk of ice is 160 km long, but only a couple of hundred meters thick, making it remarkably thin for an iceberg of its size.""Iceberg A-68 broke off from the Larsen Ice Shelf in July of 2017, losing a small piece called Iceberg A-68b shortly after it calved. Iceberg A-68 then remained largely intact for three years as it drifted past the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea.""Currents in the Southern Ocean are now pushing the iceberg past the South Orkney Islands. As it drifts into warmer waters, it is expected to fragment into smaller ice blocks, many of which could last for years among the ice surrounding Antarctica."

When humidity was raised to 80 percent, the halflife fell to six hours. When sunlight was added, the half-life dropped to just two minutes. When the virus was aerosolized in droplets that hang in the air, its half-life was one hour when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity. When sunlight was added to the equation, its half-life was only one-and-a-half minutes. The new research was announced to reporters at the White House by William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary.The study, which was carried out by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland, has not yet been released for review and is still awaiting external evaluation.Bryan's summary of the research leaves many questions unanswered, such as the intensity and wavelength of the ultraviolet light used in the experiment.In a statement sent to CNN, the Illuminating Engineering Society, a non-profit industry group, said, "Ultraviolet disinfecting 'wands' or other ultraviolet products for residential use  as they are inadequately proven and unregulated  may pose a safety hazard and are unlikely to provide the protection expected."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

New research published in the journal Nature suggests the egg may have belonged to an ancient marine reptile called a mosasaur.The fossilised egg has a soft shell and measures 29 centimeters in length and 20 centimeters in width. It is the second-largest egg recorded to date. That is roughly five times the size of a medium-sized chicken egg.Mosasaurs were marine reptiles that lived during the dinosaur era. Evidence suggests that mosasaurus gave birth to live young. However, the egg could have hatched right after being laid. This mode of reproduction is called ovoviviparity.Mosasaurs belong to an order of reptiles called squamates or scaled reptiles whose ancestors split from the ancestors of dinosaurs, birds and crocodiles roughly 240 million years ago.

"The burst was detected by satellites including NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and radio telescopes operated by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, or CHIME, and by the Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2, or STARE2, in the U.S.""Fast radio bursts are brief but cataclysmic high-energy blasts that flare for just milliseconds but release as much energy as our Sun generates in 80 years, according to previous findings published in Nature.""A magnetar is described in the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics as a kind of highly magnetized neutron star, the compressed core of a star that exploded in a supernova and collapsed in on itself.""According to NASA, a magnetar is roughly 20 kilometers in diameter and is so dense that a single tablespoon of its mass could weigh 1 billion tons. It rotates faster than ordinary neutron stars, once in less than one second.""Magnetars are surrounded by intense magnetic fields. Citing University of Toronto astronomer and CHIME member Paul Scholz, Nature magazine explains that because they spin so quickly, magnetars build up huge reservoirs of energy that could produce powerful cosmic blasts.""According to one theory, magnetars might be able to power fast radio bursts by releasing flares of energy in a starquake caused by the huge stresses exerted on the magnetar as its magnetic fields twist and snap back in place."SOURCES: Quanta Magazine, Science, Nature, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Green Bank Observatoryhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/a-surprise-discovery-shows-magnetars-create-fast-radio-bursts-20200611/https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6496/1171.summaryhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bizarre-nearby-star-offers-clues-to-origins-of-mysterious-fast-radio-bursts/https://phys.org/news/2018-10-aussie-telescope-mysterious-fast-radio.htmlhttps://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081915-023329https://greenbankobservatory.org/most-massive-neutron-star-ever-detected/***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

According to a report published in Cell Reports, experts from the University of Pittsburgh successfully developed and transplanted functioning human mini-livers into rats.Scientists created the mini livers by using human skin cells and then reverting them into a stem cell state. These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells and other types of cells can derive from them.They then used chemicals and hormones to induce differentiation. This pushed the induced pluripotent stem cells into becoming liver cells. The newly created liver cells were then seeded on mini-liver bioreactors.The lab-grown livers were then transplanted into five immunosuppressed mice or mice whose immune system would be less likely to reject the organ. Four days after the transplant, the mice were dissected in order to examine how well the  implanted organ functioned.After dissecting the rats, researchers found all five rats had blood circulation issues around the graft of the mini-liver.

Paleontologists at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology discovered they had mistakenly identified a fossil as the bone of an ancient flying reptile called pterosaur, but it actually belonged to a rare dinosaur called elaphrosaur. This is the first elaphrosaur found in Australia.Citing Stephen Poropat, the lead author of the study, The Guardian reports that only three other elaphrosaurs species have been found in Tanzania, China and Argentina.The elaphrosaur was part of the theropod family, which includes predators like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and velociraptors. It was roughly as tall as a small Emu and measures 2 meters from its head to the end of its tail."According to the research published in the journal Gondwana Research, the elaphrosaur the team discovered lived during the cretaceous period.

According to the ESA, over the last two centuries, the global magnetic field has lost 9 percent of its strength on a global average.For now, the most significant effect of the weakening of the South Atlantic Anomaly is interference with satellites and spacecraft that pass over the region. However, the Earth's magnetic field destabilizes and reconstitutes itself over geological time, with sometimes even the north and south magnetic poles trading places.According to the ESA, it is not clear what is causing the weakening of the South Atlantic Anomaly, but it could be related to the African Large Low Shear Velocity Province, one of two giant underground masses of rock that float like hidden continents where the Earth's mantle meets the outer core.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

When they hit the atmosphere, they degrade into cascades of elementary particles.Many organic molecules such as DNA and RNA can be constructed in "left-handed" and "right-handed" versions. In the paper, the researchers propose that the prebiotic soup on ancient Earth produced both left and right-handed versions of these nucleic acids.The paper argues that charged particles from cosmic rays affected right and left-handed molecules differently, conferring an evolutionary advantage on one chirality.

When they hit the Earth's atmosphere, they degrade into cascades of elementary particles.""Many organic molecules such as DNA and RNA can be constructed in 'left-handed' and 'right-handed' versions that are mirror images of each other. In the paper, the researchers propose that the prebiotic soup on ancient Earth produced both left and right-handed versions of these nucleic acids.""The paper argues that when charged particles from cosmic ray cascades reached the Earth's surface, they affected right-handed and left-handed molecules differently, giving an evolutionary advantage to one chirality.

It is one of only a handful among the 4,000 exoplanets to have been detected that is similar to Earth in both size and orbit.According to their research, which was published on May 7 in The Astronomical Journal, the world is four times the mass of Earth.It orbits a dim dwarf star that is only 10 percent the mass of our Sun. This star is so small that the researchers could not determine if it is a low-mass star or a kind of failed star called a brown dwarf.The newly discovered orbits at a distance between Venus and Earth from its parent star. But because its star's mass is so small, a year on this world lasts 617 days.To find the planet, the researchers used a method called gravitational microlensing. "The combined gravity of the planet and its host star caused the light from a more distant background star to be magnified in a particular way. We used telescopes distributed around the world to measure the light-bending effect," University of Canterbury astronomer Antonio Herrera Martin, said in the news release."These experiments detect around 3,000 microlensing events each year, the majority of which are due to lensing by single stars," the paper's co-author Michael Albrow was quoted as saying in the news release.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANVOICEOVER:"COVID-19 is an airborne disease that spreads in tiny droplets that contain the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. When people inhale contaminated droplets, the virus enters into the nose and the throat.""COVID-19 infection usually begins in the nose and throat, because the mucous membranes of these sites contain epithelial cells that are rich in ACE2 cell surface receptors. The virus needs to exploit ACE2 to get into human cells.""The coronavirus's outer coating is covered in spike proteins that give the virus its crown-like appearance. The spike protein possesses receptor binding domains, or RBDs, that the virus uses to pry open receptors before penetrating the cellular membrane.""The ACE2 receptor normally regulates blood pressure. But the coronavirus's downward RBD can bind with this receptor and allow the virus to enter, and then hijack, the host cell.""Once the virus enters the human cell, its coating dissolves and frees viral RNA to hijack the host cell's apparatuses. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum produces viral RNA and proteins, while its Golgi body packages them into whole new viruses.""As the virus multiplies, the infected person may develop early symptoms, such as a sore throat and dry cough, while spreading plentiful amounts of the virus to others. Other symptoms for the first week of infection include fever; a loss of smell and taste; and muscle aches.""The lungs contain air sacs called alveoli that keep us alive by exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen. If the virus moves down the lungs, it attacks the alveoli, which are lined with vulnerable, ACE2 receptor-rich cells.""To fight off infections, white blood cells release cytokines to summon more immune cells. Pneumonic COVID-19 may trigger cytokine storm syndrome, a phenomenon where the body scrambles too many immune cells.""As the virus attacks the lungs, the cytokine storm floods the lungs with white blood cells that destroy both healthy and infected cells. This fills the air sacs with liquids, mucous and the detritus of dead cells.""Pneumonic COVID-19 disrupts the exchange of oxygen and damages the lungs extensively, which leads to dangerously low oxygen levels that may become fatal.""When the virus gets into the heart, it strikes blood vessel cells that are rich in ACE2 receptors. Clinical studies suggest the viral onslaught causes blood clots that obstruct the artilleries and trigger heart attacks.""Intestinal cells that are responsible for absorbing nutrition called enterocytes also express the RNA for ACE2 and a related enzyme that the virus also exploits, which makes the intestines vulnerable.""A clinical study from the Chinese city of Wuhan found more than a third of COVID-19 patients suffered neurological complications." "According to the neurological study, as many as 35 percent of patients had neurological complications including impaired cognition, stroke and muscle damage.

These killer hornets are now coming out of winter hibernation.Native to Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan, Asian giant hornets can measure between 1.5 to 2 inches, or 3.8 to 25 centimeters, in length. Vespa mandarinia, also known as Murder Hornets, have stingers that deliver venom to their victims and mandibles capable of decapitating bees.According to the WSU Insider, the Asian giant hornet queen wakes from hibernation in April, finds nourishment and then looks for a place to establish a colony that will later go out to bring back food.The bee population in the United States is most threatened by these hornets from late summer to early fall. While they hunt for food for their next queens, the hornets will decapitate honey bees and eat the bee's larvae and pupae.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Location of giant Asian hornet sightings2.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA study published in the journal Biology Letters has found that exposure to microplastics can disrupt a hermit crab's ability to choose a shell. Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing microplastics. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with no microplastics. After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell. Only nine of the crabs that had been exposed to microplastics moved into the new shells, compared to 21 from the control group.This suggests exposure to microplastics impairs the crabs' cognition, and that microplastics in general can have important effects on an animal's behavior.Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen's University Belfast, told the Guardian he was surprised by the results. "We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behavior, for example," he said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

As they grow they swap shells for ones that are a better fit.""Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing seawater, seaweed and 4mm-diameter polyethylene beads. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with only seawater and seaweed.""After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell.

When humidity was raised to 80 percent, the halflife fell to six hours. When sunlight was added, the half-life dropped to just two minutes. When the virus was aerosolized in droplets that hang in the air, its half-life was one hour when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity. When sunlight was added to the equation, its half-life was only one-and-a-half minutes. The new research was announced to reporters at the White House by William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary.The study, which was carried out by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland, has not yet been released for review and is still awaiting external evaluation.Bryan's summary of the research leaves many questions unanswered, such as the intensity and wavelength of the ultraviolet light used in the experiment.In a statement sent to CNN, the Illuminating Engineering Society, a non-profit industry group, said, "Ultraviolet disinfecting 'wands' or other ultraviolet products for residential use  as they are inadequately proven and unregulated  may pose a safety hazard and are unlikely to provide the protection expected."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Preliminary results from May suggest the drug improved patient survival rate and time recovery."SOURCES: The Conversation, SatNews https://theconversation.com/remdesivir-explained-what-makes-this-drug-work-against-viruses-137751https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/04/how-gilead-drug-remdesivir-works-against-coronavirus/***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells and other types of cells can derive from them.They then used chemicals and hormones to induce differentiation. This pushed the induced pluripotent stem cells into becoming liver cells. The newly created liver cells were then seeded on mini-liver bioreactors.The lab-grown livers were then transplanted into five immunosuppressed mice or mice whose immune system would be less likely to reject the organ. Four days after the transplant, the mice were dissected in order to examine how well the  implanted organ functioned.After dissecting the rats, researchers found all five rats had blood circulation issues around the graft of the mini-liver.

Paleontologists at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology discovered they had mistakenly identified a fossil as the bone of an ancient flying reptile called pterosaur, but it actually belonged to a rare dinosaur called elaphrosaur. This is the first elaphrosaur found in Australia.Citing Stephen Poropat, the lead author of the study, The Guardian reports that only three other elaphrosaurs species have been found in Tanzania, China and Argentina.The elaphrosaur was part of the theropod family, which includes predators like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and velociraptors. It was roughly as tall as a small Emu and measures 2 meters from its head to the end of its tail."According to the research published in the journal Gondwana Research, the elaphrosaur the team discovered lived during the cretaceous period. At this time, Australia's land was located in the Arctic Circle.Researchers believe that the elaphrosaurs may have lived in a habitat containing a diverse variety of plants and trees such as conifers, gingkos, ferns, horsetails, conifers, and flowering plants.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Puhahonu means "turtle surfacing for air" in Hawaiin. Writing in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, scientists say the research vessel Falkor charted the ocean with sonar and gravity mapping technology.According to the survey, Puhahonu is 90 km wide and 275 km long, or twice the size of Mauna Loa, formerly the world's largest known volcano.Scientists say the shield volcano's size was probably the result of abundant magma flowing from a very hot spot in the mantle. The temperature of the magma that created the Puhahonu is suggested by the forsterite content that is the highest among Hawaii's volcanoes.

Preserved in the sample were spores from land plants that had flourished in the Devonian period, when Greenland was part of the Old Redstone Continent.According to the study, the fossilized spores showed a transition from healthy, normal spores to malformed and blackened spores. The deformities observed strongly suggest the parent plants suffered DNA damage from high levels of ultraviolet-B rays.The spores dated to the Late Devonian die-off, the second mass extinction in the period that saw the disappearance of many species, including giant armored sharks. The descendants of the surviving bony fish and sharks would populate today's oceans. Importantly, the second-wave extinction wiped out the first four-limbed fish that had ventured onto land.

Open Cell claims that one lab unit can churn out 2,400 tests per day.”“Test results are sent electronically via secured protocols that can be integrated for use by governmental health agencies.” “The labs could be scaled up by stacking as many as 39 the units together to form a large-scale coronavirus diagnostic center.”SOURCES: BioRxiv, Open Cell, King’s College Londonhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.20.106625v1https://www.opencell.bio/coronavirushttps://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/first-ever-affordable-shipping-container-labs-for-covid-19-testing]]></description>

It is one of only a handful among the 4,000 exoplanets to have been detected that is similar to Earth in both size and orbit.According to their research, which was published on May 7 in The Astronomical Journal, the world is four times the mass of Earth.It orbits a dim dwarf star that is only 10 percent the mass of our Sun. This star is so small that the researchers could not determine if it is a low-mass star or a kind of failed star called a brown dwarf.The newly discovered orbits at a distance between Venus and Earth from its parent star. But because its star's mass is so small, a year on this world lasts 617 days.To find the planet, the researchers used a method called gravitational microlensing. "The combined gravity of the planet and its host star caused the light from a more distant background star to be magnified in a particular way. We used telescopes distributed around the world to measure the light-bending effect," University of Canterbury astronomer Antonio Herrera Martin, said in the news release."These experiments detect around 3,000 microlensing events each year, the majority of which are due to lensing by single stars," the paper's co-author Michael Albrow was quoted as saying in the news release. "Dr Herrera Martin first noticed that there was an unusual shape to the light output from this event, and undertook months of computational analysis that resulted in the conclusion that this event was due to a star with a low-mass planet."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANVOICEOVER:"COVID-19 is an airborne disease that spreads in tiny droplets that contain the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. When people inhale contaminated droplets, the virus enters into the nose and the throat.""COVID-19 infection usually begins in the nose and throat, because the mucous membranes of these sites contain epithelial cells that are rich in ACE2 cell surface receptors. The virus needs to exploit ACE2 to get into human cells.""The coronavirus's outer coating is covered in spike proteins that give the virus its crown-like appearance. The spike protein possesses receptor binding domains, or RBDs, that the virus uses to pry open receptors before penetrating the cellular membrane.""The ACE2 receptor normally regulates blood pressure. But the coronavirus's downward RBD can bind with this receptor and allow the virus to enter, and then hijack, the host cell.""Once the virus enters the human cell, its coating dissolves and frees viral RNA to hijack the host cell's apparatuses. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum produces viral RNA and proteins, while its Golgi body packages them into whole new viruses.""As the virus multiplies, the infected person may develop early symptoms, such as a sore throat and dry cough, while spreading plentiful amounts of the virus to others. Other symptoms for the first week of infection include fever; a loss of smell and taste; and muscle aches.""The lungs contain air sacs called alveoli that keep us alive by exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen. If the virus moves down the lungs, it attacks the alveoli, which are lined with vulnerable, ACE2 receptor-rich cells.""To fight off infections, white blood cells release cytokines to summon more immune cells. Pneumonic COVID-19 may trigger cytokine storm syndrome, a phenomenon where the body scrambles too many immune cells.""As the virus attacks the lungs, the cytokine storm floods the lungs with white blood cells that destroy both healthy and infected cells. This fills the air sacs with liquids, mucous and the detritus of dead cells.""Pneumonic COVID-19 disrupts the exchange of oxygen and damages the lungs extensively, which leads to dangerously low oxygen levels that may become fatal.""When the virus gets into the heart, it strikes blood vessel cells that are rich in ACE2 receptors. Clinical studies suggest the viral onslaught causes blood clots that obstruct the artilleries and trigger heart attacks.""Intestinal cells that are responsible for absorbing nutrition called enterocytes also express the RNA for ACE2 and a related enzyme that the virus also exploits, which makes the intestines vulnerable.""A clinical study from the Chinese city of Wuhan found more than a third of COVID-19 patients suffered neurological complications." "According to the neurological study, as many as 35 percent of patients had neurological complications including impaired cognition, stroke and muscle damage.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA study published in the journal Biology Letters has found that exposure to microplastics can disrupt a hermit crab's ability to choose a shell. Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing microplastics. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with no microplastics. After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell. Only nine of the crabs that had been exposed to microplastics moved into the new shells, compared to 21 from the control group.This suggests exposure to microplastics impairs the crabs' cognition, and that microplastics in general can have important effects on an animal's behavior.Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen's University Belfast, told the Guardian he was surprised by the results. "We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behavior, for example," he said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

As they grow they swap shells for ones that are a better fit.""Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing seawater, seaweed and 4mm-diameter polyethylene beads.

When humidity was raised to 80 percent, the halflife fell to six hours. When sunlight was added, the half-life dropped to just two minutes. When the virus was aerosolized in droplets that hang in the air, its half-life was one hour when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity. When sunlight was added to the equation, its half-life was only one-and-a-half minutes. The new research was announced to reporters at the White House by William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary.The study, which was carried out by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland, has not yet been released for review and is still awaiting external evaluation.Bryan's summary of the research leaves many questions unanswered, such as the intensity and wavelength of the ultraviolet light used in the experiment.In a statement sent to CNN, the Illuminating Engineering Society, a non-profit industry group, said, "Ultraviolet disinfecting 'wands' or other ultraviolet products for residential use  as they are inadequately proven and unregulated  may pose a safety hazard and are unlikely to provide the protection expected."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

New research published in the journal Nature suggests the egg may have belonged to an ancient marine reptile called a mosasaur.The fossilised egg has a soft shell and measures 29 centimeters in length and 20 centimeters in width. It is the second-largest egg recorded to date. That is roughly five times the size of a medium-sized chicken egg.Mosasaurs were marine reptiles that lived during the dinosaur era. Evidence suggests that mosasaurus gave birth to live young. However, the egg could have hatched right after being laid. This mode of reproduction is called ovoviviparity.Mosasaurs belong to an order of reptiles called squamates or scaled reptiles whose ancestors split from the ancestors of dinosaurs, birds and crocodiles roughly 240 million years ago.

It rotates faster than ordinary neutron stars, once in less than one second.""Magnetars are surrounded by intense magnetic fields. Citing University of Toronto astronomer and CHIME member Paul Scholz, Nature magazine explains that because they spin so quickly, magnetars build up huge reservoirs of energy that could produce powerful cosmic blasts.""According to one theory, magnetars might be able to power fast radio bursts by releasing flares of energy in a starquake caused by the huge stresses exerted on the magnetar as its magnetic fields twist and snap back in place."SOURCES: Quanta Magazine, Science, Nature, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Green Bank Observatoryhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/a-surprise-discovery-shows-magnetars-create-fast-radio-bursts-20200611/https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6496/1171.summaryhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bizarre-nearby-star-offers-clues-to-origins-of-mysterious-fast-radio-bursts/https://phys.org/news/2018-10-aussie-telescope-mysterious-fast-radio.htmlhttps://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081915-023329https://greenbankobservatory.org/most-massive-neutron-star-ever-detected/***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells and other types of cells can derive from them.They then used chemicals and hormones to induce differentiation. This pushed the induced pluripotent stem cells into becoming liver cells.

Paleontologists at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology discovered they had mistakenly identified a fossil as the bone of an ancient flying reptile called pterosaur, but it actually belonged to a rare dinosaur called elaphrosaur. This is the first elaphrosaur found in Australia.Citing Stephen Poropat, the lead author of the study, The Guardian reports that only three other elaphrosaurs species have been found in Tanzania, China and Argentina.The elaphrosaur was part of the theropod family, which includes predators like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and velociraptors. It was roughly as tall as a small Emu and measures 2 meters from its head to the end of its tail."According to the research published in the journal Gondwana Research, the elaphrosaur the team discovered lived during the cretaceous period.

Research published in the journal Science Advances found that the gums of healthy individuals who used e-cigarettes contained damaging bacteria and showed signs of gum disease.The team of specialists studied the gums of 123 individuals. 25 of them were smokers, another 25 were non-smokers, 20 used e-cigarettes, 25 were former smokers who used e-cigarettes and 28 were both cigarette and e-cigarette smokers.Results showed that e-cigarette use causes a change in the microbial landscape of the gums, making its healthy bacteria unrecognizable to our immune system. This then triggers an inflammatory response in the gums and coats healthy bacteria with a layer of slime.This phenomenon was observed even in those using non-nicotine e-cigarettes.

However, the Earth's magnetic field destabilizes and reconstitutes itself over geological time, with sometimes even the north and south magnetic poles trading places.According to the ESA, it is not clear what is causing the weakening of the South Atlantic Anomaly, but it could be related to the African Large Low Shear Velocity Province, one of two giant underground masses of rock that float like hidden continents where the Earth's mantle meets the outer core.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

One of these collisions occurred roughly at the same time as the formation of our Sun, around 4.7 billion years ago. It is possible this impact contributed to the Sun's creation.The team of researchers examined luminosities, distances and colors of stars within 6,500 light-years around the Sun and then compared the information with already available stellar evolution models to understand the effects of the crashes.Data from Gaia showed three periods of increased star formation. There were peaks 5.7 billion years ago, 1.9 billion years ago and 1 billion years ago.

It is one of only a handful among the 4,000 exoplanets to have been detected that is similar to Earth in both size and orbit.According to their research, which was published on May 7 in The Astronomical Journal, the world is four times the mass of Earth.It orbits a dim dwarf star that is only 10 percent the mass of our Sun. This star is so small that the researchers could not determine if it is a low-mass star or a kind of failed star called a brown dwarf.The newly discovered orbits at a distance between Venus and Earth from its parent star. But because its star's mass is so small, a year on this world lasts 617 days.To find the planet, the researchers used a method called gravitational microlensing. "The combined gravity of the planet and its host star caused the light from a more distant background star to be magnified in a particular way. We used telescopes distributed around the world to measure the light-bending effect," University of Canterbury astronomer Antonio Herrera Martin, said in the news release."These experiments detect around 3,000 microlensing events each year, the majority of which are due to lensing by single stars," the paper's co-author Michael Albrow was quoted as saying in the news release.

This is the first detection of the species in the U.S., the Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a press release. The Hokkaido gypsy moth is native to Russia, according to the National Invasive Species Information Center from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Asian gypsy moths measure three and a half inches (about 9 centimeters) long and female moths can lay from 500 to 1,000 eggs, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.In a press release, the Washington Department of Agriculture said European gypsy moth caterpillars eat more than 500 types of trees, plants and shrubs.However, Karla Salp, a spokeswoman for the department, told UPI that Asian gypsy moths pose a greater threat than European gypsy moths because they can consume more species of plants.If the species establishes itself in Washington it would become a threat to forest ecosystems and could lead to quarantine restrictions and increased homeowner pesticide use, according to Washington's agriculture department.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANVOICEOVER:"COVID-19 is an airborne disease that spreads in tiny droplets that contain the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. When people inhale contaminated droplets, the virus enters into the nose and the throat.""COVID-19 infection usually begins in the nose and throat, because the mucous membranes of these sites contain epithelial cells that are rich in ACE2 cell surface receptors. The virus needs to exploit ACE2 to get into human cells.""The coronavirus's outer coating is covered in spike proteins that give the virus its crown-like appearance. The spike protein possesses receptor binding domains, or RBDs, that the virus uses to pry open receptors before penetrating the cellular membrane.""The ACE2 receptor normally regulates blood pressure. But the coronavirus's downward RBD can bind with this receptor and allow the virus to enter, and then hijack, the host cell.""Once the virus enters the human cell, its coating dissolves and frees viral RNA to hijack the host cell's apparatuses. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum produces viral RNA and proteins, while its Golgi body packages them into whole new viruses.""As the virus multiplies, the infected person may develop early symptoms, such as a sore throat and dry cough, while spreading plentiful amounts of the virus to others. Other symptoms for the first week of infection include fever; a loss of smell and taste; and muscle aches.""The lungs contain air sacs called alveoli that keep us alive by exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen. If the virus moves down the lungs, it attacks the alveoli, which are lined with vulnerable, ACE2 receptor-rich cells.""To fight off infections, white blood cells release cytokines to summon more immune cells. Pneumonic COVID-19 may trigger cytokine storm syndrome, a phenomenon where the body scrambles too many immune cells.""As the virus attacks the lungs, the cytokine storm floods the lungs with white blood cells that destroy both healthy and infected cells. This fills the air sacs with liquids, mucous and the detritus of dead cells.""Pneumonic COVID-19 disrupts the exchange of oxygen and damages the lungs extensively, which leads to dangerously low oxygen levels that may become fatal.""When the virus gets into the heart, it strikes blood vessel cells that are rich in ACE2 receptors. Clinical studies suggest the viral onslaught causes blood clots that obstruct the artilleries and trigger heart attacks.""Intestinal cells that are responsible for absorbing nutrition called enterocytes also express the RNA for ACE2 and a related enzyme that the virus also exploits, which makes the intestines vulnerable.""A clinical study from the Chinese city of Wuhan found more than a third of COVID-19 patients suffered neurological complications." "According to the neurological study, as many as 35 percent of patients had neurological complications including impaired cognition, stroke and muscle damage. Blood clots that travelled to the brain could be the cause of the strokes."SOURCES: National Library of Medicine, Lancet, JAMA Neurology, Nature, MIT, American Academy of Otolaryngology, Europe PMChttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15141377https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30628-0/fulltexthttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2764549https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0868-6https://news.mit.edu/2020/researchers-cells-targeted-covid-19-0422https://www.entnet.org/content/aao-hns-anosmia-hyposmia-and-dysgeusia-symptoms-coronavirus-diseasehttps://europepmc.org/article/med/32026671***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA study published in the journal Biology Letters has found that exposure to microplastics can disrupt a hermit crab's ability to choose a shell. Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing microplastics. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with no microplastics. After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell. Only nine of the crabs that had been exposed to microplastics moved into the new shells, compared to 21 from the control group.This suggests exposure to microplastics impairs the crabs' cognition, and that microplastics in general can have important effects on an animal's behavior.Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen's University Belfast, told the Guardian he was surprised by the results. "We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behavior, for example," he said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

As they grow they swap shells for ones that are a better fit.""Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing seawater, seaweed and 4mm-diameter polyethylene beads. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with only seawater and seaweed.""After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell.

Scientists then studied the fossil plankton available in newer and older sediments.Results show that changes in the ocean's water circulation have caused a decline in cold water plankton and a rise in warm water species in southern Iceland as the flow of warm water has overtaken cold waters.Scientists who participated in the study believe that these shifts have caused some fish species, such as mackerel, to travel northward.Results also showed that warm water is now reaching the Arctic. Scientists note that this could be aggravating the melting of sea ice there. The shift in the direction of the warm water currents could also affect key fisheries in the U.S. and Canada.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Atlantic Ocean circulation2.

When humidity was raised to 80 percent, the halflife fell to six hours. When sunlight was added, the half-life dropped to just two minutes. When the virus was aerosolized in droplets that hang in the air, its half-life was one hour when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity. When sunlight was added to the equation, its half-life was only one-and-a-half minutes. The new research was announced to reporters at the White House by William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary.The study, which was carried out by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland, has not yet been released for review and is still awaiting external evaluation.Bryan's summary of the research leaves many questions unanswered, such as the intensity and wavelength of the ultraviolet light used in the experiment.In a statement sent to CNN, the Illuminating Engineering Society, a non-profit industry group, said, "Ultraviolet disinfecting 'wands' or other ultraviolet products for residential use  as they are inadequately proven and unregulated  may pose a safety hazard and are unlikely to provide the protection expected."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This figure is enough to have guaranteed the complete eradication of the non-avian dinosaurs."SOURCES: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Imperial College London, Guardianhttps://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/23/2006087117https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200629150544.htmhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jun/29/dinosaurs-wiped-out-by-asteroid-not-volcanoes-researchers-say***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

Up to 60 percent of the particles reach above the toilet seat and these droplets can remain airborne for up to a minute, the researchers found.The virus could then infect others who inhale the aerosols or come into contact with infected surfaces, such as by touching door handles or toilet seats where the droplets have landed.In the journal the researchers noted that more attention needs to be paid to toilets as potential sources of infection and even toilet design, writing, "According to the characteristics of fecal-oral transmission, there will be a large amount of viruses within a toilet when a confirmed case uses it. Thus, toilets should be regarded as one of the infection sources."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Coronavirus present in the gut after symptoms disappear2.

A study published in May in the Lancet found virus particles in the feces of COVID-19 patients nearly five weeks after the patients had tested negative.""Now, researchers from Yangzhou University have used computer simulations to show that water flushed in an uncovered toilet can eject infected aerosol droplets up to three feet, or one meter, in the air. Some stay in the toilet, but up to 60 percent of the particles reach above the toilet seat.

According to a report published in Cell Reports, experts from the University of Pittsburgh successfully developed and transplanted functioning human mini-livers into rats.Scientists created the mini livers by using human skin cells and then reverting them into a stem cell state. These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells and other types of cells can derive from them.They then used chemicals and hormones to induce differentiation. This pushed the induced pluripotent stem cells into becoming liver cells. The newly created liver cells were then seeded on mini-liver bioreactors.The lab-grown livers were then transplanted into five immunosuppressed mice or mice whose immune system would be less likely to reject the organ. Four days after the transplant, the mice were dissected in order to examine how well the  implanted organ functioned.After dissecting the rats, researchers found all five rats had blood circulation issues around the graft of the mini-liver. However, the rats had human liver proteins in their blood serum indicating that the livers were working properly.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Human liver in a laboratory rat2.

Paleontologists at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology discovered they had mistakenly identified a fossil as the bone of an ancient flying reptile called pterosaur, but it actually belonged to a rare dinosaur called elaphrosaur. This is the first elaphrosaur found in Australia.Citing Stephen Poropat, the lead author of the study, The Guardian reports that only three other elaphrosaurs species have been found in Tanzania, China and Argentina.The elaphrosaur was part of the theropod family, which includes predators like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and velociraptors.

However, the bat virus does not have the spike protein parts used by SARS-CoV-2 for infecting humans.Yet another close relative, a clade of SARS-like pangolin virus from China, has receptor-binding domains that closely match the corresponding parts of the novel coronavirus.The bat and pangolin viruses likely recombined to form SARS-CoV-2. Recombining may occur when two similar viruses infect the same cell. When this happens, molecules that made up the distinct viruses are reshuffled into a new pathogen.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

However, the bat virus does not have the spike protein parts used by SARS-CoV-2 for infecting humans.""Yet another close relative, a clade of SARS-like pangolin virus from China, has receptor-binding domains that closely match the corresponding parts of the novel coronavirus.""The bat and pangolin viruses likely recombined to form SARS-CoV-2. Recombining may occur when two similar viruses infect the same cell. When this happens, molecules that made up the distinct viruses are reshuffled into a new pathogen."SOURCES: Science Advances, Duke Universityhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/28/sciadv.abb9153https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200529161221.htm***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

Puhahonu means "turtle surfacing for air" in Hawaiin. Writing in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, scientists say the research vessel Falkor charted the ocean with sonar and gravity mapping technology.According to the survey, Puhahonu is 90 km wide and 275 km long, or twice the size of Mauna Loa, formerly the world's largest known volcano.Scientists say the shield volcano's size was probably the result of abundant magma flowing from a very hot spot in the mantle. The temperature of the magma that created the Puhahonu is suggested by the forsterite content that is the highest among Hawaii's volcanoes. According to the study, Puhahonu is so massive that the Earth's crust and mantle buckled under its weight, which sank the bulk of the volcano under the sea.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This is the speed at which marine animals would have to move in order to live in waters with certain temperatures as different ocean layers become warmer.Scientists then used climate models to estimate climate velocity rates today in three different scenarios: One scenario is where greenhouse gas emissions start falling from now; another is in which emissions would begin to fall in the middle of this century; and the final scenario is one where emissions would continue to rise up to 2100.However, even in the scenario where emissions would start declining now, climate velocity in the ocean's layer that covers from 200 meters deep up to 1 kilometer down  what is known as the mesopelagic layer  would change from about 6 kilometers per decade to 50 kilometers by mid-century. Conversely, in the same period, the climate velocity rate would halve on the ocean's surface level.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Warming oceans affected by climate change2. Upper layer of ocean becoming warmer3.

This is the speed at which marine animals would have to move in order to live in waters with certain temperatures as different ocean layers become warmer.""Scientists then used climate models to estimate climate velocity rates today in three different scenarios: One scenario is where greenhouse gas emissions start falling from now; another is in which emissions would begin to fall in the middle of this century; and the final scenario is one where emissions would continue to rise up to 2100.""However, even in the scenario where emissions would start declining now, climate velocity in the ocean's layer that covers from 200 meters deep up to 1 kilometer down  what is known as the mesopelagic layer  would change from about 6 kilometers per decade to 50 kilometers by mid-century. Conversely, in the same period, climate velocity rate would halve on the ocean's surface level."SOURCES: Nature Climate Change, Hokkaido University, The Guardianhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0773-5https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/there-is-no-escaping-from-climate-change-even-in-the-deep-sea/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/climate-change-in-deep-oceans-could-be-seven-times-faster-by-middle-of-century-report-says***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

It is one of only a handful among the 4,000 exoplanets to have been detected that is similar to Earth in both size and orbit.According to their research, which was published on May 7 in The Astronomical Journal, the world is four times the mass of Earth.It orbits a dim dwarf star that is only 10 percent the mass of our Sun. This star is so small that the researchers could not determine if it is a low-mass star or a kind of failed star called a brown dwarf.The newly discovered orbits at a distance between Venus and Earth from its parent star. But because its star's mass is so small, a year on this world lasts 617 days.To find the planet, the researchers used a method called gravitational microlensing. "The combined gravity of the planet and its host star caused the light from a more distant background star to be magnified in a particular way. We used telescopes distributed around the world to measure the light-bending effect," University of Canterbury astronomer Antonio Herrera Martin, said in the news release."These experiments detect around 3,000 microlensing events each year, the majority of which are due to lensing by single stars," the paper's co-author Michael Albrow was quoted as saying in the news release. "Dr Herrera Martin first noticed that there was an unusual shape to the light output from this event, and undertook months of computational analysis that resulted in the conclusion that this event was due to a star with a low-mass planet."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANVOICEOVER:"COVID-19 is an airborne disease that spreads in tiny droplets that contain the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. When people inhale contaminated droplets, the virus enters into the nose and the throat.""COVID-19 infection usually begins in the nose and throat, because the mucous membranes of these sites contain epithelial cells that are rich in ACE2 cell surface receptors. The virus needs to exploit ACE2 to get into human cells.""The coronavirus's outer coating is covered in spike proteins that give the virus its crown-like appearance. The spike protein possesses receptor binding domains, or RBDs, that the virus uses to pry open receptors before penetrating the cellular membrane.""The ACE2 receptor normally regulates blood pressure. But the coronavirus's downward RBD can bind with this receptor and allow the virus to enter, and then hijack, the host cell.""Once the virus enters the human cell, its coating dissolves and frees viral RNA to hijack the host cell's apparatuses. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum produces viral RNA and proteins, while its Golgi body packages them into whole new viruses.""As the virus multiplies, the infected person may develop early symptoms, such as a sore throat and dry cough, while spreading plentiful amounts of the virus to others. Other symptoms for the first week of infection include fever; a loss of smell and taste; and muscle aches.""The lungs contain air sacs called alveoli that keep us alive by exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen. If the virus moves down the lungs, it attacks the alveoli, which are lined with vulnerable, ACE2 receptor-rich cells.""To fight off infections, white blood cells release cytokines to summon more immune cells. Pneumonic COVID-19 may trigger cytokine storm syndrome, a phenomenon where the body scrambles too many immune cells.""As the virus attacks the lungs, the cytokine storm floods the lungs with white blood cells that destroy both healthy and infected cells. This fills the air sacs with liquids, mucous and the detritus of dead cells.""Pneumonic COVID-19 disrupts the exchange of oxygen and damages the lungs extensively, which leads to dangerously low oxygen levels that may become fatal.""When the virus gets into the heart, it strikes blood vessel cells that are rich in ACE2 receptors. Clinical studies suggest the viral onslaught causes blood clots that obstruct the artilleries and trigger heart attacks.""Intestinal cells that are responsible for absorbing nutrition called enterocytes also express the RNA for ACE2 and a related enzyme that the virus also exploits, which makes the intestines vulnerable.""A clinical study from the Chinese city of Wuhan found more than a third of COVID-19 patients suffered neurological complications." "According to the neurological study, as many as 35 percent of patients had neurological complications including impaired cognition, stroke and muscle damage. Blood clots that travelled to the brain could be the cause of the strokes."SOURCES: National Library of Medicine, Lancet, JAMA Neurology, Nature, MIT, American Academy of Otolaryngology, Europe PMChttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15141377https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30628-0/fulltexthttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2764549https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0868-6https://news.mit.edu/2020/researchers-cells-targeted-covid-19-0422https://www.entnet.org/content/aao-hns-anosmia-hyposmia-and-dysgeusia-symptoms-coronavirus-diseasehttps://europepmc.org/article/med/32026671***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA study published in the journal Biology Letters has found that exposure to microplastics can disrupt a hermit crab's ability to choose a shell. Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing microplastics. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with no microplastics. After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell. Only nine of the crabs that had been exposed to microplastics moved into the new shells, compared to 21 from the control group.This suggests exposure to microplastics impairs the crabs' cognition, and that microplastics in general can have important effects on an animal's behavior.Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen's University Belfast, told the Guardian he was surprised by the results. "We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behavior, for example," he said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

When humidity was raised to 80 percent, the halflife fell to six hours. When sunlight was added, the half-life dropped to just two minutes. When the virus was aerosolized in droplets that hang in the air, its half-life was one hour when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity. When sunlight was added to the equation, its half-life was only one-and-a-half minutes. The new research was announced to reporters at the White House by William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary.The study, which was carried out by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland, has not yet been released for review and is still awaiting external evaluation.Bryan's summary of the research leaves many questions unanswered, such as the intensity and wavelength of the ultraviolet light used in the experiment.In a statement sent to CNN, the Illuminating Engineering Society, a non-profit industry group, said, "Ultraviolet disinfecting 'wands' or other ultraviolet products for residential use  as they are inadequately proven and unregulated  may pose a safety hazard and are unlikely to provide the protection expected."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

New research published in the journal Nature suggests the egg may have belonged to an ancient marine reptile called a mosasaur.The fossilised egg has a soft shell and measures 29 centimeters in length and 20 centimeters in width.

Their research was published in the journal Antiquity.The team of archaeologists discovered Falerii Novi by attaching a ground-penetrating radar or GPR to an all-terrain vehicle and then using it to map the buried city. A GPR sends radio pulses into the ground and then analyzes the waves that bounce off objects underground.The resulting 3D images put together by the team showed that Falerii Novi had a theatre, a market, a bath complex and temples as well as shops, monuments and atrium houses.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells and other types of cells can derive from them.They then used chemicals and hormones to induce differentiation. This pushed the induced pluripotent stem cells into becoming liver cells.

Paleontologists at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology discovered they had mistakenly identified a fossil as the bone of an ancient flying reptile called pterosaur, but it actually belonged to a rare dinosaur called elaphrosaur. This is the first elaphrosaur found in Australia.Citing Stephen Poropat, the lead author of the study, The Guardian reports that only three other elaphrosaurs species have been found in Tanzania, China and Argentina.The elaphrosaur was part of the theropod family, which includes predators like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and velociraptors. It was roughly as tall as a small Emu and measures 2 meters from its head to the end of its tail."According to the research published in the journal Gondwana Research, the elaphrosaur the team discovered lived during the cretaceous period.

According to the ESA, over the last two centuries, the global magnetic field has lost 9 percent of its strength on a global average.For now, the most significant effect of the weakening of the South Atlantic Anomaly is interference with satellites and spacecraft that pass over the region. However, the Earth's magnetic field destabilizes and reconstitutes itself over geological time, with sometimes even the north and south magnetic poles trading places.According to the ESA, it is not clear what is causing the weakening of the South Atlantic Anomaly, but it could be related to the African Large Low Shear Velocity Province, one of two giant underground masses of rock that float like hidden continents where the Earth's mantle meets the outer core.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Preserved in the sample were spores from land plants that had flourished in the Devonian period, when Greenland was part of the Old Redstone Continent.According to the study, the fossilized spores showed a transition from healthy, normal spores to malformed and blackened spores.

It is one of only a handful among the 4,000 exoplanets to have been detected that is similar to Earth in both size and orbit.According to their research, which was published on May 7 in The Astronomical Journal, the world is four times the mass of Earth.It orbits a dim dwarf star that is only 10 percent the mass of our Sun. This star is so small that the researchers could not determine if it is a low-mass star or a kind of failed star called a brown dwarf.The newly discovered orbits at a distance between Venus and Earth from its parent star. But because its star's mass is so small, a year on this world lasts 617 days.To find the planet, the researchers used a method called gravitational microlensing. "The combined gravity of the planet and its host star caused the light from a more distant background star to be magnified in a particular way. We used telescopes distributed around the world to measure the light-bending effect," University of Canterbury astronomer Antonio Herrera Martin, said in the news release."These experiments detect around 3,000 microlensing events each year, the majority of which are due to lensing by single stars," the paper's co-author Michael Albrow was quoted as saying in the news release.

The Hokkaido gypsy moth is native to Russia, according to the National Invasive Species Information Center from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Asian gypsy moths measure three and a half inches (about 9 centimeters) long and female moths can lay from 500 to 1,000 eggs, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.In a press release, the Washington Department of Agriculture said European gypsy moth caterpillars eat more than 500 types of trees, plants and shrubs.However, Karla Salp, a spokeswoman for the department, told UPI that Asian gypsy moths pose a greater threat than European gypsy moths because they can consume more species of plants.If the species establishes itself in Washington it would become a threat to forest ecosystems and could lead to quarantine restrictions and increased homeowner pesticide use, according to Washington's agriculture department.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANVOICEOVER:"COVID-19 is an airborne disease that spreads in tiny droplets that contain the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. When people inhale contaminated droplets, the virus enters into the nose and the throat.""COVID-19 infection usually begins in the nose and throat, because the mucous membranes of these sites contain epithelial cells that are rich in ACE2 cell surface receptors. The virus needs to exploit ACE2 to get into human cells.""The coronavirus's outer coating is covered in spike proteins that give the virus its crown-like appearance. The spike protein possesses receptor binding domains, or RBDs, that the virus uses to pry open receptors before penetrating the cellular membrane.""The ACE2 receptor normally regulates blood pressure. But the coronavirus's downward RBD can bind with this receptor and allow the virus to enter, and then hijack, the host cell.""Once the virus enters the human cell, its coating dissolves and frees viral RNA to hijack the host cell's apparatuses. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum produces viral RNA and proteins, while its Golgi body packages them into whole new viruses.""As the virus multiplies, the infected person may develop early symptoms, such as a sore throat and dry cough, while spreading plentiful amounts of the virus to others. Other symptoms for the first week of infection include fever; a loss of smell and taste; and muscle aches.""The lungs contain air sacs called alveoli that keep us alive by exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen. If the virus moves down the lungs, it attacks the alveoli, which are lined with vulnerable, ACE2 receptor-rich cells.""To fight off infections, white blood cells release cytokines to summon more immune cells. Pneumonic COVID-19 may trigger cytokine storm syndrome, a phenomenon where the body scrambles too many immune cells.""As the virus attacks the lungs, the cytokine storm floods the lungs with white blood cells that destroy both healthy and infected cells. This fills the air sacs with liquids, mucous and the detritus of dead cells.""Pneumonic COVID-19 disrupts the exchange of oxygen and damages the lungs extensively, which leads to dangerously low oxygen levels that may become fatal.""When the virus gets into the heart, it strikes blood vessel cells that are rich in ACE2 receptors.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA study published in the journal Biology Letters has found that exposure to microplastics can disrupt a hermit crab's ability to choose a shell. Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing microplastics. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with no microplastics. After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell. Only nine of the crabs that had been exposed to microplastics moved into the new shells, compared to 21 from the control group.This suggests exposure to microplastics impairs the crabs' cognition, and that microplastics in general can have important effects on an animal's behavior.Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen's University Belfast, told the Guardian he was surprised by the results. "We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behavior, for example," he said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

As they grow they swap shells for ones that are a better fit.""Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing seawater, seaweed and 4mm-diameter polyethylene beads. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with only seawater and seaweed.""After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell.

"Sea turtle hatchlings are preyed on by dogs, seabirds, raccoons, crabs and fish, while adult sea turtles face numerous threats from humans, including microplastics, fishing gear, human development along the ocean, boat strikes, global warming, and trade in sea turtle shells and sea turtle eggs."SOURCES: CBS News, Miami Herald, University of Florida, WWFhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/sea-turtles-are-finally-thriving-now-that-people-are-stuck-indoors-2020-04-18/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article242134506.htmlhttps://news.ufl.edu/articles/2016/05/study-proves-removing-beach-debris-increases-sea-turtle-nests.htmlhttps://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sea-turtlehttps://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/marine_turtles/asian_marine_turtles/our_solutions/turtle_trade/***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

Scientists then studied the fossil plankton available in newer and older sediments.Results show that changes in the ocean's water circulation have caused a decline in cold water plankton and a rise in warm water species in southern Iceland as the flow of warm water has overtaken cold waters.Scientists who participated in the study believe that these shifts have caused some fish species, such as mackerel, to travel northward.Results also showed that warm water is now reaching the Arctic. Scientists note that this could be aggravating the melting of sea ice there. The shift in the direction of the warm water currents could also affect key fisheries in the U.S. and Canada.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Atlantic Ocean circulation2.

When humidity was raised to 80 percent, the halflife fell to six hours. When sunlight was added, the half-life dropped to just two minutes. When the virus was aerosolized in droplets that hang in the air, its half-life was one hour when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity. When sunlight was added to the equation, its half-life was only one-and-a-half minutes. The new research was announced to reporters at the White House by William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary.The study, which was carried out by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland, has not yet been released for review and is still awaiting external evaluation.Bryan's summary of the research leaves many questions unanswered, such as the intensity and wavelength of the ultraviolet light used in the experiment.In a statement sent to CNN, the Illuminating Engineering Society, a non-profit industry group, said, "Ultraviolet disinfecting 'wands' or other ultraviolet products for residential use  as they are inadequately proven and unregulated  may pose a safety hazard and are unlikely to provide the protection expected."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
