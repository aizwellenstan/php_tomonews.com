Any robot tax would likely need to fill this gap in public finances.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the British government will collect 716.5 billion for the tax year 2016 to 2017. According to the IFS figures 43.1 percent, or 308.6 billion, of this is contributed by the 30 million people in the British workforce.Separately, a PWC study estimates that 10 million British workers may lose their jobs to automation. If permanent, and not counting the amount the government may save from automation, this would lead to a shortfall of 92.6 pounds, or 30%, in what the British state collects.A flat robot tax may help fill this gap. However, calls for automation to help people live comfortably via state-provided benefits  such as a universal income  may well see automation taxes rise.

      <title>Football players may be able to be diagnosed for CTE before death</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers may have found a way to diagnose chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players while they are still alive. CTE is a progressive brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. It usually shows up years after taking repeated blows to the head, and can lead to symptoms like confusion, depression, aggression, memory retention, and other forms of cognitive degeneration, according to Quartz. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Researchers have found that people who had CTE displayed abnormal clusters of the tau protein throughout the brain.Doctors believe the tau protein is responsible for killing off neurons.  Researchers at Boston University wanted to look for other markers in people suffering from CTE. Scientists found that people with CTE showed elevated levels of the protein CLL11 in both spinal fluid and the blood around the brain in the skull. They believe the CLL11 protein helps the smallest blood vessels in the brain move oxygen. Higher levels of CLL11 could mean these blood vessels are leaking, which may lead to CTE symptoms. The team at Boston University is now working with a biotech company to develop a blood test to detect CLL11 and diagnose living players. More research still needs to be conducted on the CLL11 protein to confirm it isn't linked with other kinds of neurodegenerative diseases. There's no cure for CTE, but early diagnosis could give players a chance to mitigate the disease.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Football players running into each other2.

The man, now 35, was involved in a car accident when he was 20 that left him unconscious, The vagus nerve extends from the brain to other parts in the body, including the heart, lungs and gut. Vagus nerve stimulation is already used to treat people with epilepsy and depression. Researchers wanted to test the ability of vagus nerve stimulation to restore consciousness in a person in a vegetative state. Patients in a vegetative state show no signs consciousness, mental activity or motor function, according to CNN. People in a vegetative state can occasionally open their eyes, however this is just a random physiological response. Vagus nerve stimulation begins with implanting a device in the chest and running a wire under the skin. This wire connects the vagus nerve and the device. The device sends electrical pulses along the nerve to the brain stem, which in turn transmits these impulses to certain brain areas.  Researchers found that after one month of stimulation, the patient’s attention, movements and brain activity significantly improved.

It's supported by a stem that's anchored to the sea floor with mooring cables, which, like the blades, is flexible and can bend under pressure.Inside the turbine head is a magnet electric generator, which transforms wave energy into electricity. The electricity is sent back to the shore via cables, to feed into the grid.Using turbines on just 1% of Japan's coastline can generate roughly 10 gigawatts of energy, equivalent to about 10 nuclear power plants.Apart from tetrapods, the turbines can also harness electricity near coral reefs.They're built to be safe for marine life, with blade speed carefully calibrated so that any animals caught in them can escape unharmed.The team is currently preparing to install two half-scale model turbines that will power LEDs as part of a commercial demonstration.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Any robot tax would likely need to fill this gap in public finances.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the British government will collect 716.5 billion for the tax year 2016 to 2017. According to the IFS figures 43.1 percent, or 308.6 billion, of this is contributed by the 30 million people in the British workforce.Separately, a PWC study estimates that 10 million British workers may lose their jobs to automation. If permanent, and not counting the amount the government may save from automation, this would lead to a shortfall of 92.6 pounds, or 30%, in what the British state collects.A flat robot tax may help fill this gap. However, calls for automation to help people live comfortably via state-provided benefits  such as a universal income  may well see automation taxes rise.

      <title>Football players may be able to be diagnosed for CTE before death</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers may have found a way to diagnose chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players while they are still alive. CTE is a progressive brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. It usually shows up years after taking repeated blows to the head, and can lead to symptoms like confusion, depression, aggression, memory retention, and other forms of cognitive degeneration, according to Quartz. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Researchers have found that people who had CTE displayed abnormal clusters of the tau protein throughout the brain.Doctors believe the tau protein is responsible for killing off neurons.  Researchers at Boston University wanted to look for other markers in people suffering from CTE. Scientists found that people with CTE showed elevated levels of the protein CLL11 in both spinal fluid and the blood around the brain in the skull. They believe the CLL11 protein helps the smallest blood vessels in the brain move oxygen. Higher levels of CLL11 could mean these blood vessels are leaking, which may lead to CTE symptoms. The team at Boston University is now working with a biotech company to develop a blood test to detect CLL11 and diagnose living players. More research still needs to be conducted on the CLL11 protein to confirm it isn't linked with other kinds of neurodegenerative diseases. There's no cure for CTE, but early diagnosis could give players a chance to mitigate the disease.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Football players running into each other2.

The man, now 35, was involved in a car accident when he was 20 that left him unconscious, The vagus nerve extends from the brain to other parts in the body, including the heart, lungs and gut. Vagus nerve stimulation is already used to treat people with epilepsy and depression. Researchers wanted to test the ability of vagus nerve stimulation to restore consciousness in a person in a vegetative state. Patients in a vegetative state show no signs consciousness, mental activity or motor function, according to CNN. People in a vegetative state can occasionally open their eyes, however this is just a random physiological response. Vagus nerve stimulation begins with implanting a device in the chest and running a wire under the skin. This wire connects the vagus nerve and the device. The device sends electrical pulses along the nerve to the brain stem, which in turn transmits these impulses to certain brain areas.  Researchers found that after one month of stimulation, the patient’s attention, movements and brain activity significantly improved.

They also had to learn to prepare food using dehydrated and shelf-stable ingredients.Communications with the outside were subject to a delay of 20 minutes  the same amount of time it takes for signals to reach Mars from Earth.To better understand the psychological impacts of a long-term space mission, they were fitted with sensors that gauged their moods and monitored interactions with other members.The mission is the fifth in a series of six studies designed to help NASA select crews that can do well on an expedition to the red planet. The sixth and final HI-SEAS mission will also last for eight months and is slated to begin in January 2018.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

If a worker accesses the email, this allows the hacker to steal their identity. The hacker then uses the stolen digital credentials to enter the banking network where they begin to comb it for data on their target.This is known as lateral movement. The hack is commonly seen in places where banks' main networks and ATM networks are not separated. Once that data is acquired, the hacker gains access to ATMs. They then order machines to dispense so-called "jackpot" amounts of cash to standby mules, waiting to collect.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

"You can't see it; you can't feel it. You don't know you're getting bombarded by radiation."Space radiation has enough energy to violently collide with nuclei that make up spacecraft shielding and human tissue, according to Science Daily.The collisions cause both the shielding nuclei and space radiation to break-up into several different types of new particles known as secondary radiation.NASA is currently investigating the effects of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on the human body.One of the main difficulties is that it's hard to simulate space radiation on Earth. Lab doses of radiation could be stronger and given for a shorter time than actual conditions in space.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Astronaut being exposed to solar radiation2.

      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEJapanese researchers have come with special technology that can not only capture energy from waves, but also help protect coastlines.According to the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, a team led by Professor Tsumoru Shintake plans to set up energy-harvesting turbines near tetrapods, which are concrete structures placed along the shore to weaken the force of incoming waves and prevent erosion.The turbine has five flexible blades modelled after dolphin fins. It's supported by a stem that's anchored to the sea floor with mooring cables, which, like the blades, is flexible and can bend under pressure.Inside the turbine head is a magnet electric generator, which transforms wave energy into electricity. The electricity is sent back to the shore via cables, to feed into the grid.Using turbines on just 1% of Japan's coastline can generate roughly 10 gigawatts of energy, equivalent to about 10 nuclear power plants.Apart from tetrapods, the turbines can also harness electricity near coral reefs.They're built to be safe for marine life, with blade speed carefully calibrated so that any animals caught in them can escape unharmed.The team is currently preparing to install two half-scale model turbines that will power LEDs as part of a commercial demonstration.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
