      <title>Roseanne tries blaming her racism on Ambien, Ambien says hold up</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWITTERLAND  Roseanne Barr is reeling from her not-so-nice Twitter tirade telling her fans, "I'm not a racist, just an idiot who made a bad joke."Barr lost her hit show on ABC after firing off a tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett where she compared Jarrett to "Planet of the Apes" and the Muslim Brotherhood on Tuesday morning. After stumbling through multiple apologies over the Twittersphere, she actually blamed Ambien for the outburst. Roseanne tweeted, "guys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me. It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting  it was memorial day too…" Barr brought ambien back into the mix in a later excuse when she tweeted, "Not giving excuses for what I did(tweeted) but I've done weird stuff while on ambien…" According to CNN, Sanofi  the maker of Ambien  clapped back in a statement saying, "While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."]]></description>

      <title>What is Manhattanhenge?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  It's an exciting time of the year for residents of the Big Apple, who get to witness the unique urban phenomenon known as Manhattanhenge.CBS reports that the term, coined by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a callback to Stonehenge, where the sun rises in perfect alignment with the stones during summer solstice.Manhattanhenge occurs around the dates framing the summer solstice, and is contingent on the exact position of the Earth on its orbital path around the sun.Manhattan's city grid is tilted 29 degrees east, with streets set at 90 degree angles. When the sun's path is at 29 degrees north of due west, it aligns with streets on the grid.The setting sun can be seen simultaneously on all streets heading east and west. It's an unusual event that happens four times a year in May and July, twice with a half sun and twice with the entire disk visible.This year, Manhattanhenge went down around Memorial day, on May 29 and 30, and will be seen again on July 12 and 13.Experts say the sunset alignment isn't just limited to NYC. Gridded cities like Chicago or Toronto experience similar phenomena, just on different dates.]]></description>

      <title>Nintendo's new joypad is a pokeball</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  Nintendo this week announced a new Switch Pokemon game that'll be released in November 2018 along with a Pokemon-themed controller.According to Gamespot, the Pokeball Ball plus joy-con works pretty much like current joy-cons except you can mimic a throwing action at one in game. Gamespot reports it'll light up, vibrate and even play sounds. And the best part, for Nintendo's coffers is that it'll be sold separately from the new Pokemon Let's Go games at launch.  It'll be Pokemon Go compatible and also reportedly have the same features as the $35 Pokemon Go Plus device. The new games, as we previously reported, will be based on 1999's Pokemon Yellow and feature Pikachu and Eevee editions. The wrist-worn plus device basically let Pokemon Go players pocket their devices and notifies them about nearby monsters.]]></description>

      <title>Skeleton of unlucky man crushed by stone uncovered in Pompeii</title>
      <description><![CDATA[POMPEII, ITALY  Here lie the remains of one supremely unlucky fella, who managed to survive an initial volcanic blast, but ended up getting squashed by a rock.Archaeologists in Pompeii have unearthed a skeleton that had been pinned underneath a 300-kilogram block of stone during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, according to a Facebook post by the Pompeii Parco Archeologico.The decapitated remains are believed to be that of a 30-year-old male. Lesions on the tibia suggest a bone infection, which would have hampered the man's ability to flee.The bones were found on the first storey level, over a thick layer of volcanic fragments called lapilli. This suggests he survived the first phase of the eruption.Scientists think the man had been hit by hot pyroclastic flows while fleeing. A massive rock thrown by the volcanic cloud then collided with his upper body, crushing his head and thorax.The unfortunate man's skeleton is the latest discovery out of Pompeii. Excavations in the past few months have unearthed the remains of a horse and a young child.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[DENVER  Southwest Airlines asked a woman to prove her relation to her biracial son while they were at the Denver airport on May 28, the BBC reports.Lindsay Gottlieb, who is white, was traveling with her African American fiance Patrick Martin and their son, when they showed the official their child's passport at the airport.However, the official asked for further evidence to prove they were a biological family, asking to see a Facebook post or a birth certificate.Gottlieb said "being pushed further to 'prove' that the child was her son felt disrespectful," the Washington Post reports.Gottlieb claimed in a tweet that she has flown with her son "approximately 50 times," and this type of an incident has never occurred.The airline was quick to apologize in a statement and said they were going to launch an investigation into the incident, CBS News reports.Gottlieb claims the officials told her that the airlines would treat the incident as a "coaching" moment for their employees, referring to Gottlieb who coaches the Women's basketball team at the University of California at Berkeley, CBS News reports.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TAMPA, FLORIDA  A Philly-bound dog gave birth to eight puppies at Tampa airport earlier this week.Service labradors Ellie and Nugget were waiting to board their flight to Philly along with their humans when suddenly their travel party got unexpectedly bigger.  Ellie was pregnant at the time, but her humans had no idea she was about to pop. The mama-to-be went into labor in the concourse and soon started pushing out puppy after puppy. Medical staff from Tampa Fire Rescue were on hand to help welcome the baby labs into the world.  Ellie gave birth to seven boys initially and then finally their sister, Fox 13 reported.Needless to say, the 10 canines and their humans missed their flight. Fox 13 reports they'll have to find a new means of travel as airlines don't allow newborn pups to fly.According to the Miami Herald, all 10 labs and their two humans will be driving 1,000 miles to Philly instead.]]></description>

      <title>De Beers plans to sell lab-grown diamonds at a cheap rate</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERKSHIRE, UK  British diamond maker De Beers said on Tuesday that they are going to sell diamonds that are "grown" in laboratories. The lab-grown diamonds are made from a carbon seed placed in a microwave chamber and superheated into a glowing plasma ball.This process then creates particles that can crystallize into diamonds in weeks.Unlike imitation gems such as cubic zirconia, lab-grown diamonds have the same physical characteristics and chemical makeup as mined stones.Despite being able to produce these diamonds in three weeks, De Beers has refused to use lab-grown diamonds to compete with mined stones, as they would not grade them in the traditional way. De Beers's CEO Bruce Cleaver said that these diamonds are not special, they are all the same. De Beers plans to launch the lab-grown diamonds under their new brand, Lightbox, with  plans to charge $200 for a quarter-carat, $400 for a half and $800 for a carat.Cited by Bloomberg, analyst Paul Zimnisky says man-made gems currently make up a small part of the diamond market, but demand is increasing. Global diamond production was about 142 million carats last year. Bonas & Co reports that compares with lab production of less than 4.2 million carats.De Beers's shift to lab-diamond jewelry comes at a sensitive time, as the British diamond makers will soon negotiate a new term with with Botswana, the source of three-quarters of De Beers's diamonds.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA  Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, found a strange case on a woman who laughs hysterically when she sees people being tickled. Referred to only as TC, the woman laughs uncontrollably when she sees someone getting tickled.Researchers concluded that the woman suffers from mirror-touch synaesthesia,  it's a condition caused by mirror neurons, connectors in the brain that react the same way when an event is experienced or observed.To make sure TC suffered from mirror-touch synaesthesia, researchers tested the her reactions in various circumstances, like seeing other people touch different surfaces. They also tested her reactions to funny video clips and jokes. It turn out she has a normal sense of humour.

Guangdong native Ms. Yu and her boyfriend were having dinner in Changsha, China when suddenly something started dripping into their dinner from the ceiling, Xiangtan News reported.Thinking it was a leak from the air conditioning unit in the ceiling, they called the waiter over.

Lucky for him, they were both fine.The manager also paid for their accommodations as they had to extend their stay in Changsha. He also paid 2,000 RMB to cover their medical expenses.

      <title>Cockroach milk is the gross new superfood you didn't know existed</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C.  You may think cockroaches are the spawn of Satan, but new research has found that the little buggers can produce a whole lotta nutrients.The Washington Post reports that unlike most insect species, the Pacific beetle cockroach is viviparous. This means it gives birth to live offspring instead of eggs,which it nourishes with a yellow, liquid substance from her brood sac.Instead of simply being digested, the liquid milk is deposited in the embryo's midguts and forms into tiny crystals. Analyses revealed the crystalline milk is a complete food containing proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, and with three times more energy than buffalo milk.It's apparently one of the most nutritious substances on the planet, but does that mean we should be guzzling the stuff?Eh … not quite. Milking a roach is hard, but even without the eww factor, there's no telling if roach milk is safe for human consumption. Fortunately, science is on it.Scientists are now reverse bioengineering the milk and working on using yeast to produce the beetle roach crystals in larger quantities.It may take a while, but someday people might hoard roach milk instead of kale and avocado.]]></description>

      <title>Televangelist seeks charity for $54M jet to share the gospel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOUISIANA  A televangelist based in Louisiana is seeking money from his followers for a $54 million jet for "the Lord's work," reports The Times-Picayune.Reportedly, the jet can "go anywhere in the world in one stop."Televangelist Jesse Duplantis is asking money to purchase a Dassault Falcon 7X, a three-engine jet with a range upto 5,950 nautical miles and with customizable cabins which can hold 12 to 16 passengers, The Times-Picayune reports.Duplantis stated in a video posted to his ministries' website that he has owned three different jets in his life, his most recent purchase being in 2006, and has "used them and burning them up for the Lord."He apparently believes that the Falcon 7X will allow him to save money and not pay "those exorbitant prices with jet fuel all over the world."When asked about his use of private jets, Duplantis defended himself saying that commercial airlines are filled with "a bunch of demons" which "get in the way of their busy schedules."Duplantis mentioned that God himself asked him to believe in Him for a Falcon 7X, and not purchase it himself, according to The Christian Post.Duplantis added that he believes that if "Jesus was physically on the earth today, he wouldn't be riding a donkey. He would be in an airplane preaching the gospel all over the world."]]></description>

      <title>Chinese minority woman forced to marry Chinese man</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  A post from Facebook account "Talk to East Turkestan" claims the Chinese government is forcing Uyghur women to marry Chinese men.  They claim that the Uyghur men are locked up and are put in "re-education" camps. They also claim that Uyghur women are then forced to marry the ethnic Han majority men in order to rescue their relatives. The Uyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group with their own distinct language and culture separate from China's ethnic Han majority.The page also claims that forced marriage is a part of the Chinese government's program to assimilate ethnic minority groups with the Han majority to reduce tensions between the different ethnic groups. In the video included with the post, a host is seen asking an apparently Chinese man how long he has known a Uyghur woman standing before him. He says "two months".In 2014, a local county government in Xinjiang, where the majority of the Uyghur people live, announced a "Uyghur-Han Marriage and Family Incentive Strategy", reports The RFA.The local government is reportedly encouraging intermarriage between the ethnic minority Uyghur and China's ethnic Han majority by offering 10,000 RMB, which is around US$1,500 to promote ethnic unity.The Chinese government is also offering incentives to children born from intermarriages, such as subsidies for medical aid and not having to pay for their education from kindergarten to high school, reports The Chinese New York Times.A Chinese official commented that intermarriage brings about "positive energy" and is a way to "realize the Chinese Dream," The Chinese New York Times reports.]]></description>

      <title>Bomb joke causes chaos on Lion Air flight as passengers flee</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PONTIANAK, INDONESIA  An Indonesian flight from Pontianak [b]to Jakarta on Monday was delayed after a flight attendant reported a threat from a passenger. A flight attendant on flight JT 687 reportedly found a bag on the floor of the plane and asked who the owner is, with a smile, passenger Frantinus Nirigi said it was his and that there was bomb in it. The man was apparently joking, but the flight attendant immediately reported the incident and the man was immediately being questioned about what's inside the bag.Most people panicked after hearing the word bomb, with one desperate passenger then opening one of the emergency exits.Flight attendants were busy instructing the passengers to exit the plane properly, but weren't able to control the crowd from trying to rush through the doors.Here is a translation of what the flight attendants said about the incident: "I asked everyone to exit the plane quickly and calmly. Some were desperate to get out, some just stood where they were. Everything was chaos and I was unable to prevent people from exiting through the emergency exit."Ten people were injured, with eight of them being taken to hospital. Only two who sustained minor injuries were able to continue with their flight.Indonesian media reports the jokester has been charged with breaching civil aviation security law, and he could face up to eight years behind bars.]]></description>

      <title>Submarine discovers shipwreck with treasures worth $17 billion</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COLOMBIA  The shipwreck of a 300-year-old Spanish ship discovered off the coast of Colombia was found to have treasures that may be worth up to $17 billion.The ship was found with the help of an underwater robot submarine. The Remus 6000 went 2,000 feet below the surface, and was equipped with a long-range sonar that scanned the sea floor. The drone also took pictures of anything that seemed unusual, CBS reports.When researchers revisited the site recently, they found cannons engraved with dolphins. The researchers claim that this is a sign the ship was the San Jose, without a doubt.The exact location the shipwreck is still kept a secret, but it was found off the coast of Cartagena, Colombia in 2015. It supposedly has a cargo full of gold, silver and emeralds that could be worth nearly $17 billion, CBS reports.Since the treasure has been discovered, both Spain and Colombia are claiming that they are the rightful owner of the ship.The researchers have mentioned that since they "are explorers, not treasure hunters," they would not be involved in the dispute between Spain and Colombia.]]></description>

      <title>Woman dies after doctor removes her ovaries during surgery</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRISTOL, ENGLAND  One of Britain's most well-known doctors is now under investigation after removing a woman's ovaries during a surgery without her consent.Reported by the Telegraph, in 2016, Lucinda Methuen-Campbell, 58, was experiencing a bowel problem and sought help at Spire Hospital in Bristol, England.The woman eventually had to go through a surgery, which was carried out by Dr. Anthony Dixon, who was internationally renowned for using mesh to fix bowel problems.The woman later learned something shocking  her ovaries had been removed during the surgery, but without her permission. Dixon told her that he did her a favor.In an interview with the BBC, Methuen-Campbell said Dixon defended his decision by telling Methuen-Campbell that her ovaries were in the way.Despite the follow-up operation, Methuen-Campbell was still experiencing excruciating pain constantly.After telling her ex-partner that there didn't seem to be a solution for her pain, Methuen-Campbell was later found dead, hanging in her attic of her home in the village of Three Crosses, near Swansea.Methuen-Campbell's ex-partner and son told the media that while she was alive, she was in a great deal of pain after the operations and was very upset that her ovaries had been removed, and no one was able to solve the problem. Swansea assistant coroner Aled Gruffydd ruled the death a suicide, and cited that the operation made the pain worse and affected the woman's mental health.Since the incident, Dixon has been suspended by both Spire[g] Hospital and Southmead Hospital, he's currently under investigation by England's National Health Service. In a response to the surgery, Dixon admitted that all operations have potential problems but they were done in good faith and most of them were successful.]]></description>

      <title>FBI agent backflips, drops gun, and accidentally shoots someone</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DENVER  An off-duty FBI agent can know convincingly claim to be the deadliest on the dance floor, but not because he can dance, because he capped someone by accident. A hilarious only because no one bit the bullet  well, technically someone kind of did  video that has since gone viral on Twitter.  The clip shows Agent So-You-Think-You-Can-Dance wiggling around in front of an impressed crowd of rhythmically challenged bar goers. Since there was no one else around to get served, Agent Pop & Lock dropped a back flip on the audience. It was all set to be an instant IG story, when the his piece dropped out of his hostler onto the ground. When Agent Dancing with the Stars went to pick it up, he accidentally popped one off right into some guy's leg. The man was taken to the hospital and is okay  well aside from being shot. According to the BBC, it's unclear if Agent Just Dance will face charges or disciplinary action. At the very least, some dance battle etiquette training might help.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[PRESTON, IDAHO  An Idaho teacher is in hot water after allegedly serving up a sick puppy as a meal to a snapping turtle in front of several students. Robert Crosland, a science teacher from Preston Junior High School, was charged last Friday with misdemeanor animal cruelty, according to CBS News. Crosland is now facing up to six months behind bars and a $5,000 fine if convicted. According to parents that snitched, Crosland served the puppy up to the turtle on March 7.  The turtle was then seized a few weeks later by state officials, who euthanized it because it was an invasive species.  Petitions have been started on both sides of the argument, those calling for Crosland's dismissal and others supporting the teacher.]]></description>

      <title>How landfill meat is recycled as food for the poor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MANILA, PHILIPPINES  In the Philippine capital of Manila, the poorest of the poor are forced to eat 'pagpag'  washed and re-cooked landfill meat  to relieve their hunger.Reuters reports that the term means "to shake or dust off" in Filipino, in reference to the act of cleaning dirt off the leftover food scraps to make it edible.When food is discarded by restaurants, it ends up at dump sites where scavengers sort through the waste for hours, picking out chicken bones and other scraps of meat. These leftovers are later separated, bagged, and then sold to families or eatery owners for a few pesos.Those who prepare pagpag first wash or boil it in water, to get rid of the germs, before re-frying or cooking it in some type of sauce.Eateries sell a pagpag meal for as little as 20 pesos or 38 U.S. cents a portion. For those who live hand-to-mouth, this is a day's wage, and the only thing they can afford.Slum-dwellers who eat the recycled meal say it's delicious, and claim no one has died from eating it.Despite warnings from health experts and the Philippine National Anti-Poverty Commission that it can cause stomach and other food-related illnesses, most say they will continue to eat it  not that they have a choice.To them, food from the garbage is better than no food at all.]]></description>

They planned to pick the pooch up at Newark Airport, CNN reported.There was a layover in Detroit, where the 8-year-old dog was held in a cargo facility.Evan Oshan, Dellegrazie's attorney, claims Alejandro was alive when he arrived in Detroit, but a little while afterward he was dead when someone went to check on him, Fox News reported.Delta officials say the pet was discovered in a cage with vomit and fluids, according to a CNN report.Oshan said the family is very upset and added that "this is essentially their family member who died. To say they are upset is a gross understatement."In a statement, Delta Airlines said, "We know pets are an important member of the family and we are focused on the well-being of all animals we transport."Delta added that they are conducting a thorough review of the situation and are working with Alejandro's family to make sure this doesn't happen again.]]></description>

      <title>Whale dead after chowing down on 80 plastic bags</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SOUTHERN THAILAND  A whale perished in Thailand last week after eating over six dozen plastic bags.According to AFP,  the male pilot whale was found struggling to stay alive in a canal in southern Thailand near the Malaysian border.A team of veterinary staff tried to help the wounded creature but its condition got the best of him last Friday afternoon The AFP reports that officials found 80 plastic bags inside the whale's belly  weighing a combined 8 kilograms. Those chunks of plastic were likely consumed by the whale, which probably thought they were squid or other fish.A marine biologist told AFP it's a huge problem, explaining that 300 marine animals die in Thailand each year after eating plastic. That number not only applies to pilot whales, but also sea turtles and dolphins.According to nonprofit organization Sea Turtle Conservancy, over 100 marine animals are killed annually due to plastic debris in the ocean. The conservancy says that there's 100 million tons of plastic in the world's oceans.]]></description>

      <title>Dying cockroach leaves egg in Florida man's ear</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA  A Florida man lived out everyone's worst nightmare after a creepy crawly burrowed into his ear and left a nasty surprise.The Tallahassee Democrat reports that Blake Collins and husband Samuel McGee had been battling a serious roach infestation in their Tallahassee apartment for over three years.The couple says dozens of German cockroaches would often pour out of light bulb sockets, crawling all over the bed and pretty much any surface in the house.  Last week though, things took a turn for the really gross.Collins woke up horrified at 5 a.m. one morning to a roach in his ear. The pest had crawled right into his ear canal, and was burrowing deeper inside.He panicked and rushed to the hospital, where a doctor used a syringe and the numbing agent lidocaine to kill the intruder.But the now-dead roach still had one surprise left: it had laid an ootheca in the 25-year-old's ear. Had doctors not pulled it out, a whopping 40 baby roaches would have burst from the one egg. Gross!Collins was later discharged from the hospital. He and McGee were let out of their lease and are now moving into a new, hopefully not roach-infested home.]]></description>

      <title>Worldwide 24-hour boycott on plastic packaging begins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EARTH  To fight ocean pollution, a campaign group is hoping to get everyone to stop using plastic-packaged products.The organization is supported by groups in Europe, Asia and the Americas.Reported by the Telegraph, more than 300 million tons of plastic are produced globally each year, and 10 percent of that ends up in the ocean. By 2050, plastic will most likely outweigh the population of fish.Campaign group "A Plastic Planet" is starting the world's first 24-hour boycott on plastic-packaged products to mark World Environment Day on Tuesday. Inspired by the world's first plastic-free aisle supermarket in the Netherlands, A Plastic Planet demanded supermarkets to have non-plastic aisles, an idea strongly supported by British Prime Minister Theresa May.Backed by celebrities, the event "One Plastic Free Day" encourages people to share photos of the plastic products they forgo on social media by using the hashtag #passonplastic.Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet told the media that plastic has no place in food and drink, and there's no logic in wrapping food in something as indestructible as plastic. Sutherland also described the use of plastic products in this day and age is equivalent to smoking addiction as we have unknowingly damaged the ocean and environment by using plastic packaged products.So what can we do to make Earth a better place? According to Plastics Oceans Foundation, there are five things you can do: use paper bags instead of plastic bags; choose products wrapped in paper instead of plastic; leave the plastic bags at the cash register; if you smoke, use matches instead of plastic cigarette lighters; use a steel bottle to fill and drink water. The organization claims, by stopping the use of plastic-packaged products or plastic products, we can increase the chances of making Earth a better place and give ourselves a more sustainable future.]]></description>

      <title>Guatemala Mt. Fuego eruption kills at least 62, dozens missing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUATEMALA  At least 62 people have been killed with dozens more missing after Mount Fuego erupted on Sunday in Guatemala, according to officials.Villages located along the mountainside were buried in volcanic ash, mud and rocks during the 16-hour eruption, the BBC reported.Mt. Fuego is a stratovolcano, which are classic-cone shaped peaks built up from layers of ash and lava rocks, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Stratovolcanoes have violent eruptions that launch columns of ash and scorching rock miles into the air. When these clouds collapse, they form deadly pyroclastic flows  avalanches of hot rocks, gas and volcanic ash.    According to the BBC, around 1.7 million people have been affected by the eruption in four regions. According to the head of the National Disaster Management Agency Sergio Cabañas, the town of El Rodeo was completely "buried."The towns of Alotenango and San Miguel Los Lotes were also affected. Temporary shelters have been set up for around 3,000 evacuated residents.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  China needs to keep its 1.3 billion citizens in check, especially now some of them have found the real world beyond the Great Firewall.To take Chinese control into the 21st century, Beijing is now shoving facial recognition and A.I. into the classroom. The West worries about things like individual privacy, while in China it's about as prevalent as clean air. According to a state-media, a high school in Eastern China is testing facial recognition to see how engaged  aka bored  students in the classrooms are in real-time. They claim the system can pick up seven moods, including happy, sad, afraid and angry by scanning a student's face. A camera in front of the classroom also can track six types of behavior such as reading, writing, raising your hand, standing up, listening to the teacher (listening!?) and leaning on the desk.]]></description>

She added the substance fell right into their eyes.Allan says she and her son went to a car wash, where they sprayed themselves off before calling Kelowna airport to report what happened, the CBC reports.An administrator reportedly told her Transport Canada would be investigating, but it was possible the goo falling from the sky was frozen lavatory waste, otherwise known as "blue ice."]]></description>

      <title>Patient stays conscious during CPR in distressing medical case</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COPENHAGEN, DENMARK  A new Danish study is raising awareness of the rare but disturbing phenomenon of patients being awake during CPR.At the Euroanaesthesia congress in Copenhagen, anaesthesiologist Dr. Rune Sarauw Lundsgaard presented the case of a 69-year-old man who went to the hospital after three days of indigestion symptoms, but suffered cardiac arrest while being admitted, CNN reports.A medical team immediately began chest compressions. CPR was administered over the next 90 minutes, with the patient reportedly showing signs of conscious awareness.A high level of awareness during CPR is extremely rare, according to experts, since blood flow to the brain is often insufficient.Strangely, the man's heart remained non functioning and without electrical activity, which caused him to lose consciousness each time doctors held off on CPR.Despite being given several shots of epinephrine, his heart failed to restart on its own. The man eventually died after compressions were stopped for good.An autopsy later revealed that the patient had suffered a complete aortic dissection, a lethal condition in which blood is forced between the inner and outer aorta layers.Since the decision to terminate CPR happened while the man was still conscious, it raised serious ethical questions, including the use of sedation when resuscitating patients.]]></description>

It is unclear how the woman came to be in the path of the train in the first place.Meanwhile, a man wearing white bermuda shorts was spotted at the scene with the victim and the rescue team in the background, all the while posing with a "V for Victory sign" and taking a picture with his other hand.Commenting on the situation, Antonella Boralevi, an Italian writer, said that the man had turned off his soul and has become an "automation of the internet."The picture has been posted across various Italian publications with most responding in a negative manner, the BBC reports.Local journalist Giorgio Lambri commented "we have completely lost our sense of ethics," referring to the man's lack of moral compass.Lambri photographed the man taking a selfie, captioning it: "The barbarism you don't expect: the 'selfie' in front of a tragedy."Other comments ranged from calling selfies a "cancer that corrodes the internet" to one Twitter user saying "Nothing surprises me anymore."]]></description>

      <title>Foul-mouthed star Lil Tay goes dark on Instagram, YouTube</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  After blowing up the internet in February with her foul mouth, a rising online star has now gone dark on social media.The South China Morning Post reports that when trash talker Lil Tay burst into the Instagram scene, she did so flashing wads of cash, cussing up a storm, and calling herself the "youngest flexer of the century".The 9-year-old's online persona capitalizes on shock value. She's a puny Asian kid who talks and acts like a stereotypical black gangsta on camera.The girl made millions in Instagram followers thanks to publicized "beefs" with famous personalities like YouTuber RiceGum and rapper Bhad Bhabie, aka the cash me outside girl.But in recent weeks, the schtick has seen some real-world consequences. Mom Angela Tian was fired from her real estate job in Vancouver, and 16-year-old brother Jason has been outed as the mastermind behind the whole production.Rumor is, the luxury homes Tay had been filming in were agency listings, and a red Mercedes she claimed was hers was in fact owned by mommy's boss.The controversial family has appeared on Good Morning America, and was most recently seen in a video that appeared to show Lil Tay smoking hookah. Her Instagram and YouTube were scrubbed of all content soon after, supposedly for rebranding.Although well before the empire went dark, Lil Tay's Twitter tried to generate buzz by challenging people to act like the potty-mouthed preteen. Since then, the internet has seen a slew of flexing videos from people eager to hitch a ride on the Lil Tay wagon.It's both interesting and more than a little disturbing to see what people make of this pint-sized human who may or may not know what she's gotten herself into.Despite insisting on GMA that she manages herself, it's become abundantly clear that Tay isn't top dog behind the scenes.More distressing is the realization that even if the girl were to leave the biz, the internet would simply move on to the next shameless act. That's just the nature of the beast.]]></description>

      <title>Guatemala volcano death toll rises, nearly 200 people still missing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUATEMALA  Emergency crews have resumed search and rescue operations in the surrounding areas affected by Sunday's Mt. Fuego eruption, which has killed at least 99 people, with around 200 people still missing.  Rescue work was stopped temporarily on Tuesday when a second eruption sent plumes of gas and molten rock down Fuego's south side, reported the BBC. Some places are still so hot that when rescuers poked metal rods into the ground, clouds of smoke came pouring out, reported The Guardian.Firefighters said the temperatures reached between 750 to 1,300 Fahrenheit under the surface at some locations.   Reuters reports the volcano had its most violent eruption in more than 40 years on Sunday when it sent ash 33,000 feet up into the atmosphere. No evacuation alert was given before the massive eruption on Sunday, said Guatemala's Disaster Relief Agency Chief Sergio Cabañas. More than 1.7 million people were affected by the eruption, with 3,319 people currently in shelters.]]></description>

      <title>Woman's advanced breast cancer cured with immunotherapy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ROCKVILLE PIKE, MARYLAND  A woman's advanced stage breast cancer that had spread to other parts of her body was cured using her own immune cells. Doctors say the treatment marks the first time a T-cell immunotherapy application for late-stage breast cancer was successful. The results were published in the journal Nature Medicine. Judy Perkins, a 49-year-old engineer, from Florida was selected for the new therapy after chemotherapy failed to stop the tumor in her right breast from spreading to her liver and other areas, according to the Guardian. She was told she only had three years to live. Doctors from the National Cancer Institute in Maryland first took biopsies from Perkins' tumors, looked at the DNA mutations specific to her cancer. Physicians then extracted immune cells called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, TILs, from the biopsies. Billions of these immune cells were then grown in the lab. The researchers then injected 80 billion of the TILs into Perkins' body. The treatment was given in tandem with pembrolizumab, a standard cancer drug that helps the immune system. After 42 weeks, tests showed Perkins was completely free of cancer. According to the Guardian, researchers are now planning full scale clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Mt. Everest cryptocurrency PR stunt tragically cost a Sherpa's life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOUNT EVEREST  A cryptocurrency PR publicity stunt organized by a social networking site has reportedly cost a Sherpa's life who helped lead a team up Mount Everest.For their upcoming cryptocurrency offering, social networking site ASKFM thought they needed something different to draw attention from the public.On May 14th, the social networking site sent four cryptocurrency enthusiasts to climb Mount Everest to bury two hardware wallets containing $50,000 worth of their tokens, ASKT.And whoever's brave enough to climb the mountain and lucky enough to find the hardware wallets, get to keep them and the ASKT tokens. So why the audacious move then? According to the company's blog post, cryptocurrency offering isn't something fresh anymore, so AskFM being one of world's top 10 social networks and world's largest Q&A platform, can definitely afford to make symbolic statements and draw attention.However, the whole thing wasn't such a smooth climb as ASKFM's post mentioned that two of the climbers were stranded at above 7,000 metres with no reserve oxygen until they were rescued by air response on the second day.One Sherpa wasn't so lucky, he reportedly went missing at about 7,900 metres when the team was descending down the mountain, and he never made it down.In an interview with the Financial Times, ASKFm's CEO Max Tsaryk admitted the event was tragic and horrifying but said the company should not be blamed for it, instead the Sherpa's death should be directed to the company that represented him.The CEO was later asked if he had felt this campaign had gone too far, Tsaryk said he didn't think there's much difference between ICO marketing and standard marketing stunts, therefore his company should not be blamed for a stunt that went wrong.]]></description>

      <title>Orangutan tries to defend jungle home from bulldozer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WEST KALIMANTAN, INDONESIA  A heartbreaking video shows an orangutan in Indonesia desperately trying to stop humans from destroying its home.The Independent reports that the footage was filmed in 2013 in Borneo's West Kalimantan, but only recently uploaded to Facebook by International Animal Rescue.In the video, the orangutan can be seen frantically running across a fallen tree trunk toward a large excavator. It grabs at the excavator bucket with its bare hands, seemingly in an attempt to stop it from wreaking more havoc in the jungle.When the machine moves, the animal fails to hang on, and instead tumbles off the trunk and onto the ground.Two men from the animal charity can be seen running after the distressed primate, and appear to shoot it with a tranquilizer dart. The organization claims on their post that they managed to rescue the poor animal and bring it to safety.Sadly, more and more habitats in Indonesia are being destroyed by loggers, leading to death and starvation in the orangutan population.Unless we stop the madness and start rebuilding, our future will look much like Borneo's forests: gone.]]></description>

      <title>Soldier steals armored vehicle for a 2-hour drug-fueled joyride</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BLACKSTONE, VIRGINIA  A soldier under the influence of drugs boosted an armored personnel carrier from a National Guard base on Tuesday and went for a short little spin around downtown Richmond. Joshua Philip Yabut, 29, jacked the M577 armored vehicle around 7:50 p.m. from Fort Pickett in Blackstone, police said. The vehicle was not equipped with any weaponry, but that didn't stop him from tearing down Route 460 and then towards Richmond on Interstate 95 at a cool 40 miles per hour. While all this was going on, a parade of police cars formed behind the personnel carrier as it was cruising around. Armed police officers protected the entrance to Capitol Square as a police chopper followed the armored vehicle from up above.  Yabut eventually drove onto a median at was surrounded around 9:40 p.m. He was tased and taken into custody. Luckily, no one was injured in the incident.  The soldier has been charged with driving under the influence of drugs, one felony count of eluding police and one felony count of unauthorized use of a vehicle.]]></description>

      <title>NASA Curiosity rover finds ancient organic matter on Mars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARS  After decades of searching for organic compounds on the Red Planet, scientists have finally been successful.NASA announced on Thursday that rock and soil samples taken by the Curiosity rover from Mars' Gale crater has yielded organic molecules believed to be 3 billion years old.Organic molecules refer to chemical compounds that contain carbon. They can come from both living and nonliving sources, and are the chemical building blocks for all life on Earth.Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument, or SAM, heated the samples to over a thousand degrees Fahrenheit, releasing small hydrocarbons that may be fragments of bigger, more complex molecules.While the organics could have resulted from biological activity, NASA says they are just as likely to have emerged from geological processes, or from a meteor crashing into the planet.Still, the discovery of the molecules sheds light on the planet's history  painting a picture of an ancient Mars that had favorable conditions for life.It likewise spurs on future explorations, with both NASA and the European Space Agency developing new technologies to search for signs of life.]]></description>

      <title>Sonic attacks in China may be side effects from intrusive surveillance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUANGZHOU, CHINA  Alleged cases of "sonic attacks" in China and Cuba has raised the question of how sound can used as a weapon.U.S. diplomats in Guangzhou, and previously Havana, have been diagnosed with unexplained brain injuries following abnormal sensations of sound and pressure, prompting fears of a sonic weapon, The New York Times reports.Ultrasound is a possibility, but an unusual weapon choice: it loses power with distance more quickly than audible sounds, and requires precise alignment with a subject.University of Maryland researchers theorized that the illness may have resulted from surveillance gear being positioned too closely together.Ultrasonic devices can interfere with each other in a phenomenon known as intermodulation distortion, producing audible sound similar to what patients claimed to hear.When placed at too close range or combined with other ultrasonic emitters, these devices can cause cavitation damage, causing bubbles to form in body fluids, tissues, or cells.It's hard to say for certain what exactly triggered the diplomats' mystery ailments, but more than one expert has chimed in to say bad engineering or a bad spy job is more plausible an explanation than a sonic attack.]]></description>

Erik fell in the gap and can be seen disappearing from the CCTV view. The man was reportedly trapped under there for an hour, before firefighters were able to rescue him and transport him to the hospital for unspecified injuries.

Unfortunately, even the guy from animal control admitted that he was afraid of the snake.Goff then asked for advice from her colleagues who suggested that she use glue pads to trap the snake, reports Fauquier Now.After trapping the snake overnight, Goff and her husband went to check on it. The snake was reportedly stuck to the glue pad but it wasn't dead...yet.Goff commented that her husband threw it in the back of his truck..saying that she "doesn't know and doesn't want to know" what he did to it.]]></description>

      <title>Days on Earth are gonna get longer because of the moon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  New research shows that days on Earth are getting longer as the moon slowly spirals away from us.Due to gravitational forces between Earth and its satellite, the moon moves away at a rate of 3.82 centimeters per year, causing our planet's rotation to slow, according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Earth currently completes a full rotation on its axis every 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds, according to NASA.But researchers using astrochronology on geological rock layers found that when the moon was closer to Earth 1.4 billion years ago, a day was just over 18 hours.The length of a day has grown one seventy-five thousandth of a second on average per year, and is expected to continue at this rate for the next millions or billions of years.The Guardian reports that the moon will eventually stop moving when it reaches a stable distance from Earth. When this happens, the two will be tidally locked- rotating at the same pace, with the moon visible from only one side of Earth.Of course, that's assuming either of them survive the Sun's destructive red giant phase.]]></description>

      <title>Everything you need to know about the June 21 solstice</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C.  The 2018 summer solstice will soon be upon us, marking the beginning of different seasons depending on where you live. The earth rotates on a tilted axis while orbiting the sun, which means different parts of the planet are pointed at or away from the sun depending on the time of year.During the solstice on June 21, the North Pole is tilted toward the sun, allowing it to shine at a 90-degree angle on the Tropic of Cancer, which sits at 23.5 degrees north of the equator.Anyone standing right on the Tropic of Cancer at noon on solstice day will see the sun directly overhead, and find themselves casting a very minimal shadow.Since the northern hemisphere faces the sun, it will experience the longest day and the start of summer. For the southern hemisphere, which tilts away from the sun, it is the shortest day and the start of winter.]]></description>

      <title>How did Easter Islanders put 13-ton hats on moai statues?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EASTER ISLAND  Researchers say they have figured out how Easter Islanders transported 13-ton stone hats across the island and placed them on top of 33-feet tall moai statues.The study, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, examined how ancient islanders were able to move the additional red stone cylinders, pukao, on tops of the statues, according to NPR. Easter Island has almost 1,000 moai statues spread across the island, with around 100 of them wearing the pukao hats. Researchers say the pukao were added later, but are unsure of the exact dates.  After constructing 3D models of the stone cylinders, scientists closely analyzed the details and features of each pukao.They developed a hypothesis that the hats were rolled up to the top of the statues using long ramps with a technique known as parbuckling.  Archaeologist Carl Lipo, co-author of the study, described the technique being similar to the way barrels used to be loaded onto cargo ships, saying "people would wrap ropes around the center of the barrel and then, from the top of the ramp, pull the barrel up the ramp. … All the attributes we saw match that model." Using the 3D models, the team was able to calculate how long the ramp would have to be, in addition to how many workers would be required to pull the pukao into place. With a ramp 75 to 328 feet long, with an incline of 5 to 20 degrees, a team of 15 people could maneuver a pukao into position, according to ArsTechnica.]]></description>

The virtual windows are supposed to look 'just like the real thing," reports ABC Net.Aviation expert Douglas Drury claims there aren't really any safety concerns. Though Drury says that there should be windows in critical places, such as the emergency exits, to have a clear view of the aircraft wings.]]></description>

      <title>Teen drowns after hair clogs up the shower drain in freak accident</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA  A Pennsylvania family is in mourning their teen daughter after she died in what is said to be a freak accident while taking a shower. CBS-affiliate KDKA reported that when Michael Rapp got a phone call early the morning of June 1st, his ex-wife informed him of the shocking news of their daughter Brianne's passing. In an interview with KDKA, Rapp said Brianne was in the shower, getting ready for school while his ex-wife was still asleep.Rapp said Brianne, who was later found by his ex-wife, probably blacked out in the bathtub and fell and hit her head, at which point her hair must have clogged the drain and caused the tub to overflow, consequently drowning her.Rapp added that his daughter had a thyroid problem and took medication for it, although he's uncertain if Brianne had slipped and fell or just blacked out. The coroner did not immediately release the official cause of Brianne's death.Rapp went on to say that he will miss his daughter's smile, her great personality, and how she wanted the best out of life. He added that he and his ex-wife are proud to have raised a daughter that people had great things to say about.A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family finance their funeral expenses, and in just six days, more than the targeted amount was raised. The family added that any money left over would be placed in a college trust fund for Brianne's brother and sister, in her memory.]]></description>

      <title>Is Rockstar's new game a Red Dead cash grab?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS SANTOS  Gamers are worried one of this years most anticipated games will follow a controversial gaming model called termed "Pay to win".Pay-to-win is controversial because it enables gamers to use real world cheddar to progress quickly in games and get ahead of others who are playing the game as normal.Red Dead Redemption 2, due out this fall, looks good, but as YouTuber Worth a Buy noted earlier this month, the game's single player and online multiplayer seem to follow a pay-to-win model.Red Dead 2 developer Rockstar Games also makes the Grand Theft Auto series. GTA5 has a fun online multiplayer, but players can also use real world money to get ahead in it.Some fans view this as a cash-grab, baiting players with expedited access to content they should earn. Others, apparently, seem to enjoy this model and are OK with it. According to GameDebate,com GTA5 has made Rockstar over half-a-billion dollars since 2013.As WorthABuy notes, Red Dead 2 will feature several editions, priced all the way up to $100. Playstation players will also get access to some exclusive content first, ahead of other platforms, reports GameSpot.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists discover new planet more than 600 light years away</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  A team of scientists in India have discovered a sub-Saturn sized exoplanet, reports the Financial Times.The planet, called EPIC 211945201b or K2-236b, is reportedly 600 light years away from Earth.The planet has a mass of around 27 Earths while its radius is six times that of Earth. Scientists used the PRL Advance Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search spectrograph, or PARAS, to measure the mass of a planet travelling around a star.The surface temperature of the planet is approximately 600 degrees Celsius, which makes it virtually uninhabitable. Distance-wise, it is seven times closer to its sun-like star in comparison to Earth and its sun.It takes around 19.5 days to complete one rotation around its Sun-like star.The scientists believe elements such as ice, silicates, and iron content make up around 60-70 percent of the total mass of the planet, based on the calculations of the mass and the radius, reports The Economic Times.This type of a discovery is crucial in our understanding of how these types of planets are formed, the Financial Express reports.]]></description>

      <title>Little girl temporarily paralyzed from tick bite</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GRENADA, MISSISSIPPI  A 5-year old Mississippi girl was temporarily paralyzed after getting tick bite during one of her T-ball games. Kailyn Kirk was fine after her game, but when she woke up the next morning she couldn't walk.  When her mother Jessica Griffin  who posted about the incident over Facebook  started combing through Kailyn's hair, she noticed a tick in her scalp. After consulting with her husband, who is currently deployed in Iraq, she put the tick in a ziplock bag and rushed Kailyn to the hospital.At the University of Mississippi Medical Center, Kailyn had some blood work and a CT scan. Doctors later diagnosed her with tick paralysis. Tick paralysis is caused when female ticks bite someone on the scalp or at the nape of the neck, and release a toxin from their saliva. Tick paralysis is normally very sudden  within 24 hours. To treat tick paralysis, the tick only needs to be removed. People usually recover within a day. According to her mom, Kailyn was a champ through the whole ordeal. She even walked out of the hospital by herself later that evening.]]></description>

      <title>Venezuela hit by first case of polio in 30 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[VENEZUELA  A young child is reportedly afflicted with polio in Venezuela  the first reported case of the crippling disease since it's eradication in the country in 1989.The Telegraph reports that according to the Pan-American Health Organization, the child lived in an impoverished indigenous community in the Delta Amacuro state.According to the CDC, poliomyelitis, or polio, is caused by the poliovirus, which enters through the mouth via contact with contaminated feces, or through droplets from a cough or sneeze.The virus multiplies in small intestine, before being carried through the bloodstream to the central nervous system, where it destroys motor neuron cells.The majority of infected don't get sick, while one in four develop non-paralytic polio with flu-like symptoms. Paralytic polio, though rare, can lead to muscle pain, paralysis, and even death.In some cases, those who contracted and fully recovered from the disease as kids can develop symptoms years later as adults.Young children, especially those who are malnourished an unvaccinated, are especially susceptible to polio. The disease has no cure, but is preventable through immunization.Venezuela has been plagued with economic and political crises in recent years. Local health authorities who were supposed to report cases of polio within 24 hours, took more than a month to do so.]]></description>

      <title>Raccoon climbs 22 stories up high rise in St. Paul, Minnesota</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA  All eyes in America are on a restless raccoon that scaled up a skyscraper in St. Paul, Minnesota on Tuesday.Minnesota Public Radio's Tim Nelson noticed the animal had been stranded on the ledge of the two-storey Town Square building for two days without food or water.Maintenance staff tried to rescue it, but instead of coming down, it instead scampered over to the high-rise next door and climbed up. Next thing you know, trash panda is scaling up the side of the UBS tower like a Spider-ninja, and everyone is riveted.By Tuesday afternoon, the little hairball had made it more than 20 stories up. Employees from the Paige Donnelly Law Firm on the 23rd floor spotted it resting and grooming itself on a ledge.Since a rescue attempt might just spook the furry fella, animal control put live traps with food on the roof hoping to lure it up.But seems like Spider-raccoon won't be captured, and has instead begun the long laborious climb to the bottom. And since raccoons are nocturnal  it's gonna be a long night.As the whole nation waits in silent agony for a resolution, speculation abounds as to why the animal pulled a King Kong.More than a couple have suggested the raccoon is secretly Rocket, who can't deal with the heartbreak of Infinity War, and maybe wants to "Make America Groot Again."There's even a fake fan account on Twitter complete with elaborate backstory on how the critter got into its current predicament.Whatever it turns out to be, let's all just say a prayer, keep fingers, toes, and everything else crossed, and hope that raccoon makes it down safely.]]></description>

      <title>Ancient Earth map lets you look up addresses across 750M years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Ever looked at a map of Earth millions of years ago and wondered where certain modern-day locations were supposed to be?The Ancient Earth globe is a cool little online tool curated by Ian Webster  the same genius who meticulously compiled the Dinosaur Database.Webster's interactive map allows users to see how the earth has evolved from 750 million years ago to the present. To do so, he adapted a software used by geologists to visualize plate tectonics, and overlaid his map with modern political boundaries. It's got the added bonus of an address search, so you can pin a location and see where it was during the ice age, the age of dinosaurs, or even post-extinction.The site has neat extras, like short descriptions on the bottom left hand side that lets you know exactly what the conditions are during any given time period.Alternatively, there's an option to jump through the stages of evolution, like when the first vertebrates appeared, or the first primates, or hominids.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple is releasing a new software update that will make it much harder for police and criminals to crack iPhones to access data.The company said on Wednesday the update is called USB Restricted Mode and will close off data access through an iPhone's Lightning port if the device hasn't been unlocked in the past hour, CNET reports.The update is meant to close a security hole that left customers at risk to identity thieves.According to the company, "At Apple, we put the customer at the center of everything we design.

      <title>Birdwatchers in India rescued bird with beak shut by plastic ring</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BASAI, INDIA  A bird in India with its beak clamped shut by a plastic ring was fortunately rescued by Indian birdwatchers who feared it would starve to death.Reported by The Times of India, the stork was rescued about 9 a.m. on Wednesday in Basai wetland, a suburb of India's capital.Luckily, the bird was rescued by birdwatchers and wildlife officials and was taken to a bird sanctuary for treatment. Surprisingly, the dehydrated bird was nibbling on a small fish and is in good condition despite living without food for at least seven days. Black-necked storks are classified as "near-threatened" on the Red List of threatened animals and are native to parts of India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. But only 50-60 of the birds are found in the wetlands region outside Delhi.When the photo of the stork with its beak shut by the plastic ring emerged on the internet this week, it immediately captured attention from around the world. Pankaj Gupta, a bird watcher and member of the Delhi Bird Foundation, who was involved in the rescue mission said the plastic ring could have come from a bottle or can, and is likely to have slipped onto the bird's beak when it was hunting in the water, and then got stuck there.The stork is currently being looked after by officials of the Sultanpur National Park and bird sanctuary, they will put it back into its natural habitat once it's deemed fit. The BBC reported that environmentalists in India want the Basai area to be protected and are hoping to build a factory there to deal with the recycling construction waste.]]></description>

      <title>Insidious horror ads shown to kids ahead of YouTube Frozen clips</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  British kids were exposed to movie ads featuring a demonic monster attack ahead of videos showing Frozen and Minecraft clips.Britain's Ad-regulator the Advertising Standards Authority said kids had been shown adverts for the new Insidious movie, the BBC reports.Children were seeing these pre-roll ads in front of Lego how-tos, cartoons and the aforementioned Frozen and Minecraft videos.Columbia Pictures, a Sony company, said they were targeting adult audiences with the pre-rolls and had removed children and unknown audiences from their campaign targets.Google-owned YouTube says it lets advertisers control their campaigns and are responsible for their own content. The ads were apparently seen between December 2017 and January 2018 by kids and some adults, who complained they were distressing. The regulator claims it received five complaints in total. The pre-rolls for the movie, rated 15-years and older in the UK, showed women screaming, and a monster attacking a woman. The regulator told Sony to better target it's ads in the future, but according to the BBC, an investigation by the company found it to be YouTube's algorithms to be at fault.The BBC says in its report that it understands YouTube is "now limiting its ads for mature content to a pre-vetted list of safe YouTube channels." If true, that means less ad dollars for other creators through no fault of their own.]]></description>

      <title>Oakland 'Jogger Joe' throws out homeless man's stuff</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA  Netizens are fuming after an online video captured a jogger throwing out a homeless person's belongings in Oakland.The incident occurred near Lake Merritt, close to where the now infamous BBQ Becky called the cops on two men for barbecuing while black, SFGate reports.On Friday, Henry Sintay, 30, was apparently so offended by a homeless man's things that he paused during a run and started dismantling the makeshift encampment.Bystanders confronted Sintay as he tossed stuff into the lake and a nearby garbage can. When asked to stop, he fired back that he was simply taking out the trash. JJ Harris, one of the bystanders, filmed the confrontation and put it up online. After video of his douchebaggery blew up, Sintay  now dubbed "Jogger Joe" by the internet  returned the next day to pull stuff out of the lake. While being asked questions by a community organizer, Jogger Joe attacked the man and stole his phone, not realizing it was live-streaming the whole thing.Sintay has since been nabbed by Oakland PD and is facing a felony charge of second-degree robbery, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.Supporters have also come together to help Drew, the homeless man whose belongings Sintay trashed. They gave him new blankets and clothes over the weekend and put up a GoFundMe page that has now amassed over $10,000.]]></description>

      <title>Climate change maybe wiping out thousands-years-old trees</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AFRICA  Climate change maybe killing some of the world's most ancient and beautiful trees, according to new research. Writing in a new study in the journal Nature Plants, researchers detail how they tracked African Baobab trees using radiocarbon dating since 2000.According to Popular Science, the researchers looked at at 60 trees in total.Their findings report that nine of 13 oldest trees have began to perish, as have five of six larger ones. The deaths just began occurring in the last 12 years, scientists don't know particularly why.But they do have a guess and it's the usual suspect: climate change.Speaking to the Los Angeles Times via email, lead author Adrian Partut explained the trees were used to "drier and colder conditions, but possibly not to hotter conditions.Partut told the Times he and researchers suspect that the combination of "temperature increase and extreme drought stress were responsible for these demises."]]></description>

      <title>Trump has a bad case of dictator envy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Donald Trump made history this week as he met Kim Jong-un in Singapore.One thing that has become evidently clear is that Trump has a real affinity for dictators.While meeting with the G7, Trump proposed letting Vladimir Putin back into the G8, while at the same time just skipping over the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. The problem is that as Trump gushes over dictators, he threatens the very democracy that protects the world from these evil douches. President Trump literally is the most powerful man in the world, yet he looks up to spineless autocrats and envies their "strength."  And with all this North Korea nonsense going on, Trump has once again been played, because it's not North Korea that is causing the problems in Asia  it's China.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[US  Apple has set new rules for app developers which ban the creation of cryptocurrency mining apps on its mobile devices to protect iOS users, reports IT world.Apple is moving to stop the practice of hackers using a portion of the CPU power from thousands of different iPads or iPhones to mine cryptocurrency.Apparently, Apple has made several rule changes stating that any apps, "including third party advertisements..may not run unrelated background processes, such as cryptocurrency mining."ComputerWorld reports that the cryptocurrency-mining services "thrash your CPU, and  drain your battery."ComputerWorld also reports cryptocurrency services are known for spreading malware, reportedly being one of the top offenders of doing so.Apparently cryptocurrency services use a small piece of JavaScript it installs on websites, advertisements then uses the code to hijack part of the CPU power of the device to mine cryptocurrency. This practice is known as "cryptojacking."Cryptomining malware has been on the rise in the past year, following the rise of cryptocurrency, IT world reports. For now, Apple is the only one to ban cryptocurrency mining apps, however Google may soon join Apple in the decision.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[KANSAS  A Tennessee woman is preemptively suing NASA in order to keep a vial of moon dust allegedly given to her by Neil Armstrong. The lawsuit was filed by Laura Murray Cicco on June 6 at the U.S. District Court in Kansas to decide who legally owns the dust, according to Cincinnati Enquirer.The woman is challenging NASA's 2011 court case declaration that private citizens cannot own lunar material.Cicco says in the lawsuit that her father was a friend of Neil Armstrong, and that when Armstrong was an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Cincinnati, he gave the vial to her as a gift. The lipstick-size vial also came with a note that said, "To Laura Ann Murray  Best of luck  Neal Armstrong Apollo 11."Well...good move Laura. Now the whole world knows that you have this moon dust  which you definitely could have kept no problem had you only kept your trap shut.]]></description>

      <title>NASA's Mars rover gets stuck in dust storm, agency loses contact</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE RED PLANET  NASA lost contact with their Mars-based Opportunity robot this week after a massive dust storm set about its position on Mars.That storm has, according to the space agency, made it almost completely dark, making it hard for the solar powered machine to operate. Curiosity, NASA's other Martian rover, is nuclear powered and not reliant on the sun. The space agency believes that the robot has entered low power mode where only a mission clock remains active. NASA reckons the large amounts of dust it has encountered will stop it from charging for some time. The dust storm, active since May 30, covers some 14 million square miles of Mars. For comparison, that's more than double the size of Russia  Earth's largest country.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[VIETNAM The World Dog Alliance is shining a spotlight on the hidden truth of dog meat consumption throughout Asia, especially in Vietnam.Reportedly more than 80% of the population of Vietnam consumes dog meat, with dogs being killed, burned, and grilled in open areas as well as restaurants.Some restaurants even emphasize the idea that "eating dog meat can change your fate," with dog meat often being served as a traditional dish.The dogs are put in tiny cages where they suffer from overheating, hunger and dehydration and are transported to different regions across Vietnam.Upon arriving at the slaughterhouse, the organization says dogs are force-fed to fatten them up, while dog meat traders hold the dogs down with a clamp while doing so. Locals even believe that the quality of the dog meat is better if "the dog was miserable before dying."The high demand of dog meat is a result of the Vietnamese belief that dog meat is "rich in protein" and "eating tough meat meat makes a tough man."The trade is lucrative in Vietnam because of high profits stemming from high demand.Dog traders can purchase a dog in Thailand for 5 to 7 US dollars and sell it in Vietnam for 100 US dollars.However because dog meat is so popular, dog traders often resort to stealing pets, street dogs, or even smuggling dogs in Vietnam or from other neighboring countries for a profit.This is a very pressing issue regarding the abuse and torture of these canines.Unfortunately YouTube often chooses to demonetize videos highlighting such atrocities, which ultimately does not help in shining a light on this issue.The World Dog Alliance claims it is the only organization dedicated to 'explicit legislation against dog meat' worldwide, and says it is working to expose the true nature and cruelty of the dog meat trade across the world.]]></description>

      <title>Deadly plant that causes burns, blindness spotted in Virginia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CLARKE COUNTY, VIRGINIA  Virginians are being warned to keep their eyes out for the giant hogweed plant, which can cause third-degree burns and even blindness.Thirty of the deadly plants were recently found at a site in Clarke County, according to the Massey Herbarium at Virginia Tech, though they've been known to grow in other states.Giant hogweeds are huge and invasive. They grow up to 14 feet and have sharply lobed leaves, umbrella-shaped white flowers, and hollow, hairy, purple-splotched stems, according to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.Their sap contains toxins called furanocoumarins, which can make human skin hypersensitive to sunlight.If not washed and covered immediately, the skin can develop itchy burning blisters, with scarring, discoloration, and sometimes persistent sun sensitivity that can last years. The sap has also been known to cause temporary or permanent blindness when it comes in contact with the eyes.Experts strongly advise against taking out the plant with a weed whacker, since the sap could splatter and spread.Physical removal or the use of herbicides is a much more effective  not to mention safer  option. Or, just call it in and leave it to the pros.]]></description>

Residents killed the python and found Tiba had been swallowed head first and her body was discovered intact.  Giant pythons have been known to take down small animals, but attacks on people are rare.

      <title>Florida trapper saves gator from 10-foot-long python</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA  An Everglades alligator would have been snake chow if not for a man who saved it from a suffocating death.The Miami Herald reports that Florida trapper Mike Kimmel and friend Jack Hubbard had spotted the python near some bushes, and realized as they approached that it was wrapped around a small gator.In a video posted to Facebook, Kimmel is seen grabbing the 10-foot-long snake by the head and lifting it up. The python is still coiled around its prey, but soon releases its grip.The 4-foot gator falls to the ground and quickly scurries away, but the snake isn't so lucky. Like all the others Kimmel's caught, it'll be euthanized and turned over to the state for study. Once it's given back, he claims its skin is sold and its meat used as well.As a contractor for the South Florida Water Management District's snake removal program, Kimmel says this is the third gator he's saved from a python in the past year.The invasive snakes were likely introduced to the Everglades via the exotic pet trade, and have since displaced gators as the top predator.In the last year alone, Kimmel and other contractors have removed over a thousand pythons  but the problem is persistent, and won't go away anytime soon.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  A group representing Asian-American students has filed a lawsuit against Harvard, citing discriminatory admissions practices.According to court documents, Students for Fair Admissions commissioned an analysis of applicant records from 2014 to 2019, and found that Asian-Americans were consistently rated lower than others on personality traits, despite having high SAT scores, GPAs and full extracurriculars.In the 1920s, Harvard and other Ivy League schools used the same subjective criteria to limit the number of Jewish students. Now Asians are getting the Jewish treatment and are being given low personal ratings to hurt their chances of getting in.Duke University economist Peter Arcidiacono, the expert who conducted the analysis for Students for Fair Admissions, says the low scores were from admissions officers who've often never even seen the students in the flesh. Meanwhile, alumni interviewers who actually met the applicants consistently gave top marks.Students for Fair Admissions alleges that Harvard knew what was up. The university's own internal investigation in 2013 revealed a biased system. But instead of addressing the issue, it axed the investigation and buried the reports.The school has denied the allegations, defending their process as "holistic" and claiming that Students for Fair Admissions cherry-picked variables from the admissions data to fit their cause.At the end of the day, it could be argued that Harvard admissions only wants what's best for the school, but if that involves racial discrimination, then obviously there's something wrong.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. expecting North Korea to return troop remains</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The United States is expecting North Korea to return up to 200 sets of remains believed to be troops who died during the Korean War.According to CNN, administration officials said arrangements are being made to accept the remains, although no set date or location have been yet been determined. The Defense Department says there are up to 5,300 sets of U.S. service member remains still in North Korea, with a total of 7,697 personnel still missing in action. Some of the remains were from downed pilots, others from ground troops, while others may be those who died as prisoners of war. When the transfer does occur, it is expected North Korean officials will give the remains to United Nations officials at the DMZ. The UN will then hand them over to U.S. military personnel. The remains will then be sent to a military laboratory in Hawaii for DNA identification and matching.]]></description>

      <title>Dad shows how easy kids can fall into pools in terrifying video</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ATTLEBORO, MASSACHUSETTS  A Massachusetts dad is sending out an important warning on pool safety after seeing how easily his toddler could fall into a pool.CBS reports that Keith Wyman was shocked the first time he witnessed his son Cody climb up a locked pool ladder. The second time, he was ready with a camera.The Wymans' pool is above ground, with a small ladder and a door that closes over the steps to prevent access. But in a video posted to Facebook, Cody can be seen putting his feet in between the door slots and hoisting himself up.The 2-year-old makes it to the rim of the pool in less than a minute before being grabbed by mom and returned to the ground.The couple have since returned the ladder and are trying to get the manufacturer to change the design to make it really childproof.In the meantime, Wyman advises parents to watch their kids like a hawk, and be especially vigilant when there's a pool nearby.]]></description>

      <title>WHO labels gaming addiction a disorder but experts disagree</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GENEVA  Video game addiction is now a disease, according to the Word Health Organization, and it's being called "gaming disorder."The WHO says the disorder can manifest in individuals who are obsessed with videogames, particularly those who game longer and do it in place of other activities.They also warn the disorder may hurt relationships with family and friends and activities in work and school. For a gaming disorder diagnosis an individual needs to show symptoms for around a year, according to the WHO.In a December 2016 paper, a plethora of experts from the world over refuted the WHO classification. Writing then, they argued that the gaming disorder definition "should be removed to avoid a waste of public health resources as well as to avoid causing harm to healthy video gamers around the world."]]></description>

      <title>American infants are basically black holes for processed sugar</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SUGARLAND  A new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that U.S. infants are consuming excessive amounts of sugar that even exceed maximum levels recommended for some adults. The results were presented at the American Society for Nutrition's annual meeting on June 10, Quartz reports.Researchers focused on the sugar added during food preparation or processing such as cane sugar, high-fructose corn syrup and honey, not natural sugars found in fruit or milk.  The study looked at more than 800 children between six months and 23 months who had taken part in the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Parents were told to keep track of every item their child ate or drank during a 24-hour period. Scientists then calculated an average sugar intake from the sample.The results showed toddlers 12 to 18 months consumed 5.5 teaspoons of sugar per day, while toddlers 19 to 23 months ate 7.1 teaspoons a day.For comparison, the daily recommended limits for added sugar for children 2 to 19 years old and adult women is 6 teaspoons or less a day, and 9 teaspoons or less a day for adult men.]]></description>

Research published in the journal Nature Communication describes how scientists found the bacterium Yersinia Pestis on the teeth of 3,800-year-old human remains in Samara, Russia.Researchers looked at the remains of nine people, two of them had the bacteria.Yersinia Pestis gave rise to the bubonic plague. The scientist used sequencing to analyze the samples and found that they pre-date current thinking on the plague's lineage  3,000 years  by around 1,000 years. Researchers suggest that there was at least two strains of plague lineage floating around at the time. Previously it was suggested to be one.]]></description>

      <title>Drinking too much can lead to a whole bunch of nasty cancers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BETHESDA, MARYLAND  A new study finds that light drinkers have the lowest combined risk of developing cancer and dying prematurely, even when compared to people who did not drink at all. According to NPR, scientists looked at 100,000 adults in their mid-50s to early 70s, and had each complete a survey about their alcohol consumption. Researchers then tracked these people for nine years and found that the more alcohol consumed, the higher the risk of developing cancer and dying. The findings were published in the journal PLOS Medicine. Heavy drinkers were the most at risk. Scientists found that men who drank three or more drinks per day were three to four times more likely to develop esophagus or liver cancer. Other alcohol-related cancers were colorectal and breast cancer in women.According to NPR, a drink is a single shot of liquor, 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer.]]></description>

      <title>NASA outlines plan to protect the Earth from an asteroid strike</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C.  The chances of a space rock colliding with Earth in the near future may be slim, but here's good news for anyone paranoid about an asteroid armageddon: NASA's got a plan.Titled "National Near-Earth Object Preparedness and Strategy Action Plan", the document details the steps NASA and Federal Emergency Management Agency will take to prevent asteroids from hitting Earth, and to prepare the planet should such a catastrophic event take place.Large asteroids can obliterate life on Earth, but smaller ones may also cause serious damage. The 130 to 200-foot wide asteroid that hit Tunguska, Russia in 1908, for example, levelled over 700 square miles of forest, and would have been able to destroy the entire metropolitan New York area.The outlined plan involves five main goals. The first involves enhancing detection of near-Earth objects, or asteroids that pass within 28 million miles of Earth's orbit. The second goal is to improve modelling and prediction, to help determine when and where a potential asteroid strike will occur.The third objective is to come up with new ways to deflect an asteroid, such as the Double Asteroid Redirection Test that's set to be launched in 2021.Goal four aims to increase international cooperation, while the fifth and final goal calls for the U.S. to come up with an emergency plan should an asteroid ever crash with little to no warning.]]></description>

      <title>Mother must wash baby in bleach to keep him healthy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHATTAROY, WASHINGTON  In recent reports, an American mom talks about how she needs wash her baby boy in bleach to help protect him from disease.Alicia Barber's infant son Jamison suffers from Harlequin ichthyosis, a rare genetic skin condition and needs round-the-clock care.Because of this, Barber needs to bathe him in bleach two times per week to stave off infection.  According to Metro, Barber needs to use clorox while washing Jamison. That is painful for him, so he's on morphine while being washed. In addition to that, Jamison is also bathed twice for 45 minutes daily, and then rubbed with a sandpaper rag to help shed his skin. According to rarediseases.org, Jamison's condition causes thick layers of plate-like skin scale to form. If untreated, the skin can make it difficult for the child to breath and eat. Approximately one in half a million suffer with the condition.  Barber's trying to raise awareness of her son's condition and is hoping to attend a medical conference that addresses it specifically. It takes place in in Nashville, Tennessee and the family has set up a GoFundMe account to help with the cost. So far, they've raised closed to $10,000, blowing way past their $6,000 target. https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-us-get-to-nashville]]></description>

      <title>Toxic black henna tattoos may scar you for life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Holiday henna tattoos are a cute little souvenir of days in the sun, but they could also open up a world of pain if you're not careful.The BBC reports that Mary Bates found this out the hard way, after getting a dreamcatcher henna-tattooed on her ankle during a vacation in Turkey.After about an hour, the tattoo lines on the then 16-year-old's skin became raised. It got worse over time, resulting in blistering, oozing, and a lot of skin peeling.Bates would later find out that she was having a reaction to black henna.Natural henna is entirely safe and made from plant-based ingredients. It hardens and peels off, and should leave an orange stain that becomes darker over the next few days.But black henna, contrary to the name, isn't actually henna. It's a synthetic black dye that's chock-full of the chemical PPD, which is toxic to the skin.While not everyone will experience a reaction to black henna, the risks can be severe for those that do. Bates had to get steroid treatments, and was at the hospital every week for over a month before her ankle got better. Now 19, she is relieved the scar wasn't permanent.Many others though, have not been so lucky, and still bear the scars of a little holiday fun gone wrong.Experts are cautioning tourists to only use henna that's brownish or olive-green in color. Anything that's jet black and purports to dye instantly should be avoided.]]></description>

      <title>Orlando airport to use face scans on all international travelers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ORLANDO, FLORIDA  Long, snaking lines may become a thing of the past for passengers travelling through Orlando's main air hub.The Orlando Sentinel reports that Florida's Orlando International Airport is set to be the first U.S. airport to use facial recognition to process passengers on all inbound and outbound international flights.The scans will be checked against passenger passport photos and travel information on a Department of Homeland Security database, to verify a travelers identity.Biometric screening is expected to speed up passenger processing, but concerns have been voiced over privacy and potential information theft.In response, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection says scans in the database are deleted after 14 days, but could be removed almost immediately in the future. Photos of foreign nationals, however, are also kept in the Automated Biometric Identification System for up to 75 years.The system currently claims to have a 99% accuracy rate, though officials can manually screen passports and fingerprints if a photo doesn't match or a U.S. citizen decides to opt out.Once fully implemented, facial scanners will be stationed inside the airport's 30 international departure gates and two CBP checkpoints. The technology is also being used in other U.S. airports, though to a lesser degree.]]></description>

      <title>Woman calls police on black kid selling water in viral video</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Permit Patty is the latest white person to cry cop over black folks doing the most mundane things.According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the subject of her outrage was 8-year-old Jordan Austin, who on Saturday was selling bottled water outside her San Francisco apartment to help finance a trip to Disneyland.Patty, whose real name is Alison Ettel, got ticked off that the girl was shouting loudly and disturbing her work, so she stormed down and called her out for illegally selling without a permit.When the child's mother intervened and argued with Ettel, she threatened to call the police, prompting mom to pull out her own phone and record the incident.In a video posted on Instagram, Ettel can be seen ducking behind a structure with a phone to her ear, but is followed and confronted by the elder Austin's camera.Once the post went viral with over a million views, karma came swiftly for Permit Patty. Internet sleuths found out she ran a company that made cannabis products for pets. So on top of getting hate online, she's also suffering financial repercussions, with several business associates cutting ties.Permit Patty later told the Huffington Post she only pretended to call the cops, and now feels "discriminated against"' Oh please.Little Jordan, meanwhile, might be retiring her cooler after a kind soul heard about her story and sent four tickets to Disneyland as a gift.]]></description>

      <title>Saudi Arabia finally lets women behind the wheel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAUDI ARABIA  Saudi Arabia is probably the most progressive country in the world, which is why it went ahead and finally lifted its ban on female drivers. The Saudi monarchy always listens to its people. Sure, it may have taken 30 years for them to hear it, but hey.  According to the AP, women will no longer have to rely on their hubbies, dads or brothers to run some simple errands, get to work, visit friends or drop kids off at school. According to CNN, the Ministry of Interior and Traffic Directorate officials said that more than 120,000 women applied for a driver's license on Sunday. Saudi Arabia really is blazing a trail. Spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country has an ambitious plan to overhaul its economy in a project called Vision 2030. It includes a revolutionary and radically progressive new idea  hiring women. At this rate, Saudi Arabia will hands down be the best place to live right around the end of human civilization.]]></description>

      <title>Gene-edited pigs immune to deadly virus</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MIDLOTHIAN, UNITED KINGDOM  Scientists have successfully made pigs resistant to a deadly virus by editing their genes.According to the study, published in the Journal of Virology, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome  or PRRS  causes breathing problems and death in young pigs, and stillborns in infected sows.To address this, researchers from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute used gene editing to remove a small section of the pigs' CD163 receptor, which the PRRS virus attaches to. They then exposed the gene-edited pigs to the virus and found that the animals did not become infected.Scientists say the genetic edit is permanent, meaning the pigs' resistance to the disease will be passed down through natural breeding.The Edinburgh team stressed that unlike genetic modification, which is highly controversial, no foreign genes are added in during the editing process. But with no regulations in place, it may take years before the technology can be applied to commercially raised swines.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WOODSIDE, CALIFORNIA  Koko, the gorilla famed for her ability to communicate using American Sign Language and amazing friendships with pets, died in her sleep last week at age 46.  Koko was a western lowland gorilla born at the San Francisco Zoo in 1971. She soon formed a close bond with Dr. Francine "Penny" Patterson.The following year, Dr. Patterson started teaching Koko sign language as part of a Stanford University project.Koko was said to have an IQ of between 75 and 95, could understand 2,000 words of spoken English. The average IQ for humans is 100, with most people scoring somewhere between 85 and 115.Koko adopted several cats, and used sign language to give them names. She even grieved for one of her kittens when it was killed in a car accident. Koko's love of animals turned into a children's book called "Koko's Kitten" and her own line of toys. Due to her fame, Koko became the subject of many documentaries and was on the cover of National Geographic.Koko also met quite a few celebrities, from the late actor Robin Williams, Betty White, Leonardo Dicaprio, and her favourite celebrity Fred Rogers.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CANADA  Trump is no stranger to winning, and if there's a Starburst tossing title out there, it should have his name on it.Trump was kind enough to share his Starbursts with the big kids at the G7 meeting two weeks ago, reports CBS.Trump went into big boy mode when the other leaders were ganging up against him, reports The Metro.The world leaders were trying to get things done while Trump was his usual Trumptastic self.Apparently, Angela Merkel was pressuring Sunny Delight to sign a joint statement when he pulled out the candies from his pocket and said "don't say I never give you anything."Trump initially agreed to do so, but then pulled out by a series of tweets and lashed out against the G7.]]></description>

      <title>French jogger detained for accidentally crossing US border</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BLAINE, WASHINGTON  A French woman who went jogging on a Canadian beach was sent to a U.S. immigration detention for straying across the border.Cedella Roman, 19, was visiting British Columbia and running along the beach that leads to Canada's border with 'Murica on May 21. As the tide began to rise, she turned onto a dirt path, stopped to take a picture then started heading back, not realizing she had accidentally strayed into U.S. territory.That's when she was pounced on by two U.S. border patrol agents who slapped cuffs on her for crossing into Blaine, Washington. The officers then took Roman 136 miles south to the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center.According to the BBC, Roman was crammed into a room with about 100 other people. They were locked up the whole time with barbed wire and dogs.She called her mom in B.C., who brought Roman's passport and work permit, but U.S. officials wouldn't release her until Canadian immigration said it was okay for Roman to come back.Finally, after 15 days, Ms. Roman was allowed to put this ridiculous ordeal behind her.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  The Chinese Communist Party is planning to track all new cars using RFID chips in a voluntary program that begins on July 1, that will become mandatory by 2019.   According to the Wall Street Journal, China's Ministry of Public Security and the ministry's Traffic Management Research Institute is working on the new tracking system.Chinese officials claim that windshield RFID chips will help the government study and improve congestion, thereby reducing pollution.

      <title>Woman's moving facial bumps turn out to be roundworm</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOSCOW  A woman used selfies to document bumps migrating around her face, and was horrified to discover what was actually inside.According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the 32-year-old spotted the first nodule just below her left eye. Five days later, it appeared as three small bumps above her left eye. After 10 days, it migrated again, this time to her upper lip, making it swell significantly.The nodules were itchy and caused a burning sensation, though no other symptoms were reported. Doctors suspected some sort of parasite after seeing the patient's selfies, and spotted a moving oblong nodule during the physical exam.They surgically removed the unwanted visitor using forceps, revealing it to be a 9-millimeter-long roundworm. The worm was later identified as Dirofilaria repens, which is more commonly found in dogs and spread through mosquitoes.The woman recalled being bitten by mosquitoes during a recent trip to a rural area outside Moscow, and likely got infected there.Doctors say she has recovered fully since being rid of the nasty worm.]]></description>

      <title>Teen's random act of kindness for blind, deaf passenger goes viral</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE FRIENDLY SKIES  A California teen offered a helping hand when a blind and deaf man aboard an Air Alaska flight needed help communicating. According to CBS News, Clara Daly was flying on an Air Alaska flight with her mom on the way back to California. Shortly after takeoff, a flight attendant made an announcement asking if anyone knew sign language aboard the plane. They said they had a blind and deaf passenger who could only communicate by signing into his hand. Enter Clara, who's been studying American Sign Language. The teen walked and began signing into his hand to help him communicate with flight attendants. According to Clara's mom over a Facebook post, Clara helped him ask for water and how much time was left on the flight. After that, they were just chatting it up. The man's name was Timothy and he was flying to Portland. Clara and her mom were originally supposed to fly on a direct flight to L.A., but had to scramble after their that flight was canceled.

      <title>Spanish church tries really hard to restore sculpture</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ESTELLA, SPAIN  The Church of San Miguel in Estella hired a crack local arts and crafts teacher to restore a priceless 16th-Century wooden statue of St. George.Images of the newly restored statue have now gone viral, but unfortunately for all the wrong reasons. St. George is now sporting a new bright, pink face with some really colorful body armor.For some odd reason, many are less than pleased with how things turned out.    The Guardian reported that the town's Mayor Koldo Leoz said, "they've used plaster and the wrong kind of paint and it' possible that the original layers of paint have been lost. This is an expert job it should have been done by experts."The group in charge of the restoration is called Karmacolor and even uploaded a Facebook video showing each step of the process. Too bad it's been deleted already.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[PENNSYLVANIA   Officers have cracked a 1992 murder case by getting a hold of the suspect's chewing gum and water bottle, reports The Washington Post.Christy Mirack was a young teacher in Pennsylvania, excited for the Christmas holidays like anyone else.The next day when she didn't show up at school, the principal called and then drove down to her townhouse.He goes inside and finds Mirack on the floor, with Christmas presents for her students strewn around on the floor.The police reportedly investigated the case and determined she was beaten, strangled and sexually assaulted.Unfortunately, the investigators never could find who murdered the poor woman...until now.Twenty-five years after the case went cold, investigators turned to genetic genealogy, a new technique where investigators match publicly available genealogical information with DNA found from victims at the crime scene. The investigators matched the DNA to Raymond Rowe, a popular wedding and event DJ, who was also known as "DJ Freez."The investigators then went on an undercover investigation at an elementary school party where Rowe was the DJ and collected a piece of Rowe's chewing gum as well as a used water bottle, reports The Star.The suspect was reportedly taken into custody on Monday, without being officially charged yet.Genetic genealogy has helped solved a number of other crimes, however it has raised privacy concerns about DNA being publically available for everyone.]]></description>

She tells him to never do again, that it's not polite and not right. Off-cam, the man can be heard apologizing repeatedly.Guimaraes said that while she never experienced this in Brazil, it's happened to her twice during the World Cup in Russia.She hasn't been the only victim either. Days before, a Colombian Deutsche Welle reporter got kissed and groped on-cam by an entitled douchebag.She chose to continue the report despite the interruption, which DW later denounced as "blatant harassment" and an attack.]]></description>

      <title>HBO website blocked in China after John Oliver mocks Xi Jinping</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  The HBO website is the latest to be blocked by China's Great Firewall, after John Oliver had a bit of fun with its president.The New York Times reports that the British comedian did a 20-minute segment on China on his satirical news show "Last Week Tonight," critiquing the country's human rights record and dystopian surveillance tactics.What really did it though, was joking about Xi Jinping and Winnie the Pooh, his pants-less, pot-bellied 2D twin.Xi is especially sensitive about his cartoon doppleganger, so much so that images of the bear have been purged on Chinese social media. Like Pooh, Oliver's name and show have been censored on Weibo, with attempts to post either resulting in "Send failure!" or "Content is illegal!"HBO's website has also been inaccessible to Chinese netizens since Saturday, though HBO shows like Game of Thrones are still available on Tencent's streaming platform.The Great Firewall's kill list currently includes a whole slew of blocked Western media outlets, including Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, and the New York Times. But mainland internet users hellbent on accessing these sites have their ways.]]></description>

      <title>South Korea plans railway linking Korean Peninsula and Russia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL  Following the successful inter Korean summit, South Korea is now planning to build an extensive network that will connect the Korean Peninsula to Russia via rail.AFP reports that North and South Korea have begun talks about connecting their railways, using existing lines that run from Seoul to Pyongyang, and on to the Chinese border city of Sinuiju.The project also plans to build a separate high-speed railway that would allow trains to go from Seoul to Sinuiju at speeds of up to 350 kilometers per hour, reports Donga.Current North Korea rail infrastructure only allows slow moving trains at less than 50 kph, and will need to be upgraded to handle increased speeds and heavier loads.The completed lines will later connect to Moscow and the rest of the Trans-Siberian railway, ultimately establishing a land route between Europe and the two Koreas.The railway plan is one of the trilateral infrastructure projects between South Korea and Russia, the other two being energy and electricity.]]></description>

      <title>NSA maybe snooping en masse via 8 AT&amp;T locales</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FORT MEADE, MARYLAND  The U.S. National Security Agency used eight AT&T facilities across the country as part of a mass surveillance program, according to the Intercept.According to the Intercept, the National Security Agency may be using AT&T buildings across the U.S. as part of a mass surveillance program called FAIRVIEW.The Intercept identified AT&T facilities in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington and New York city. The website reports that these locations process AT&T customer data, as well as large amounts of information from other internet providers inside the U.S. and abroad.The FAIRVIEW program, in which AT&T is the sole member, reportedly gives the NSA access to international communications cables, routers and switches.  According to the New York Times, this provided the agency access to billions of metadata records, as well as texts, emails and phone calls.An AT&T spokesperson told the Intercept the company was "required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement."The NSA told the website they couldn't confirm or deny their reporting, but said they are "bound by both policy and law to protect U.S. persons' privacy and civil liberties."]]></description>

      <title>Woman walks away after crashing car into gas station</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRANDON MISSISSIPPI  A Mississippi woman is lucky to be alive and unscathed after a gas station car crash that's possibly one of the craziest ever caught on camera.Mississippi News Now reports that according to a deputy on the scene, the incident occurred after driver Shelby Lynn May got off work, where she'd had one too many drinks.Her compact white sedan was spotted speeding over 100 miles, going into oncoming traffic and nearly colliding with another vehicle before crossing back over.Surveillance footage from the Marathon Xtra Mile gas station shows the car skidding into an embankment and going airborne. It crashes through a brick sign before flipping and landing in between two fuel pumps.Miraculously, none of the gas pumps were hit, and May literally walked away with only very minor injuries.She wasn't lucky enough to escape the law though, and has been arrested and charged with driving under the influence. She posted a $1,500 bond on Friday and is scheduled for a day at court on July 10.]]></description>

      <title>Tanacon: Ballsy attempt to create the anti-VidCon ends in disaster</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA A YouTuber’s convention she created to rival popular event VidCon wound up failing spectacularly at the weekend.YouTuber Tana Mongeau got mad at Vidcon after they wouldn’t give her featured status at Vidcon 2018. That would’ve gave her extra security and a designated spot for her fans. So Tana thought decided to do her own and partnered with organizers Good Times. The con had a solid lineup, reportedly featuring dozens of YouTubers with everyone from Casey Neistat to Shane Dawson.In a ballsy move, they hosted it on the same day, time and place as Vidcon and in Anaheim, California. She expected about 5,000 people with tickets but 20,000 showed up.  She gave the tickets away for free, charging $65 for VIP access. A vidcon community badge costs $150.Problem was, Tana’s venue  the Marriott Suites  could hold a few thousand tops. Reportedly, the disorganization left some fans baking under the hot Cali summer sun for hours before getting in and then finding out there was not much to do. On its first day  it was supposed to be run across two days  authorities shut it down because the whole thing was a damn fire hazard. Then thing got canceled, and let’s just say folks were mad.Tana’s promised refunds, tweeting she’ll write the checks herself if she has to and also asking those who traveled far to email her to discuss compensation.]]></description>

      <title>Rescuers search flooded caves for missing Thai soccer team</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHIANG RAI, THAILAND  Heavy rains and flooding are hampering search and rescue efforts for a young soccer team and their coach, who went missing in northern Thailand.The Bangkok Post reports that a dozen boys aged 11 to 16 and their 25-year-old soccer coach have been missing since going into Chiang Rai's Tham Luang cave on Saturday, June 22.The long cave complex has several chambers which have flooded due to rain. Rescue divers found handprints in one area, but have yet to reach a section of dry ground where the boys are believed to be trapped.High-pressure pumps have been installed inside the cave to drain flooded passages, but persistent rainfall has kept water levels rising.Workers searching for alternative entryways found a vertical shaft that likely lead into the cave, and dropped food and water in case the team was nearby.Authorities are also planning to drill new passageways to speed up the hunt for missing soccer players. They remain hopeful that the team will survive since tourists trapped in the cave during past floods were rescued once the waters receded.]]></description>

NASA reports that Mars will be in "opposition" at the same time. This means Mars and the Sun will appear on opposite sides of Earth.Mars will be visible to the naked eye, looking like a bright, orange star.Mars will reportedly appear "five times brighter than usual" and spectators will be able to view the planet in the evening sky, which will appear dimmer and dimmer as Earth moves away from Mars.Astronomer Dean Regas, told Newsweek that most of the world, except Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland and Iceland would be able to view the phenomenon next month after sunset.]]></description>

In the now viral video, Guzman asks "Why do you hate us?""Because you're Mexicans," the lady shoots back. "We're honest people right here," Guzman replies."Yeah, rapists," the woman says. "Even the president of the United States says you're a rapist." Yeah, but he also says he's only 239 pounds.

      <title>Animals becoming nocturnal to avoid humans</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA  Like the dinosaurs millions of years ago, humans are now the planet's super predator, and it's driving all other wildlife to take the night shift.In a new study published in the journal Science, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley analyzed previous studies that captured the 24-hour movements of over 62 medium to large-bodied mammal species across six continents.They found that human disruption made animals 1.36 times more nocturnal on average, meaning those that typically split activities evenly between day and night became 68% more active at night.Human disturbance in this case wasn't just limited to destructive behavior. Even activities like hiking, farming, or wildlife-viewing evoked the same behavioral pattern.The consequences are potentially negative. Animals that lack the traits to thrive nocturnally become vulnerable to non-human predators, affecting their chances at survival and reproduction.Scientists have already noticed some of these changes. Coyotes in California's Santa Cruz Mountains have begun hunting at night to avoid hikers, forgoing their usual daytime prey of squirrels and birds for nocturnal rats and rabbits.Though more research needs to be conducted on the topic, it's important for humans to be more mindful of how we're impacting animal habitats, and aim for coexistence.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese oppression intensifies in Xinjiang</title>
      <description><![CDATA[XINJIANG, CHINA  China's continued crackdown against the country's Uyghur ethnic minority shows no signs of abating.Uyghurs are a Turkic Muslim minority primarily located in the Xinjiang Province in western China. Since the arrival of a new regional party secretary from Tibet in 2016, they have been facing increasingly constraining measures, reports the New York Times.Authorities can arbitrarily send people to detention camps considered suspicious, without charge or trial.
