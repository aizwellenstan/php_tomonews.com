      <title>Rare two-headed copperhead snake found in Virginia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WAYNESBORO, VIRGINIA  Scientists are ecstatic over the discovery of an exceptionally rare two-head copperhead alive in the wild.According to the Wildlife Center of Virginia, a woman in Northern Virginia spotted a baby copperhead snake slithering in her yard, and upon closer inspection found it had two heads.Radiographs revealed that each head has its own brain, trachea, and esophagus, but shared a heart and a set of lungs. The left trachea is more developed than the right, while the right esophagus is more developed than the left.Scientists say it's better for the right head to eat based on the snake's anatomy, but are attempting to feed the left head due to it being more dominant and responsive.Two-headed serpents are an extremely rare find in the wild as they often have trouble coordinating their movements when escaping from predators, which contribute to their short life spans.The competing heads also tend to fight over food, though this particular copperhead's mutation is such that its heads don't quarrel, and seem almost oblivious to each other.Herpetologists estimate the animal is about 3 weeks old, but have yet to figure out its gender. They will continue to monitor the snake, and likely place it in a zoo or educational facility if it survives.]]></description>

      <title>PCBs in ocean threaten livelihood of killer whales</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DENMARK  Toxic chemical polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, were found lingering in marine life such as killer whales, according to a new study published in the journal Science.PCBs were banned in most countries decades ago, however they are still used in some parts of the world, which has allowed them to gradually seep into oceans, according to CNN.PCBs were used in paints, coolants, carbonless copy paper and other products. PCBs can be consumed by plankton, which are then eaten by larger fish. As the PCBs move up the food chain, they become more concentrated. This puts killer whales in danger of consuming highly concentrated PCBs as they are near the top of the food chain. The chemical was found to disrupt the whales' reproductive system, brain function and the endocrine system.Mother whales can also pass the deadly chemicals on to their offspring through lactation.  Researchers warn animals living off the coasts of the UK, Brazil, Hawaii, and Japan have a high risk of population collapse because of PCBs.ORCA, a charity group dedicated to protecting whales, described the report as "an absolute tragic state of affairs andâ€¦ needs immediate action."]]></description>

      <title>Limiting kids' screen time could boost brain power</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   An observational study has found that two hours of recreational screen time a day along with more sleep is linked to improved cognition in children.According to a study published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health, the Canadian 24-hour Movement Guidelines recommends 9 to 11 hours of sleep per night, less than two hours of screen time, and an hour of physical activity daily for kids aged 8 to 11.But a study of 4,520 U.S. children found that only 5 percent met all three recommendations. Forty-one percent met at least one guideline, 25 percent met two guidelines, while 29 percent met none at all. On average, American children slept 9.1 hours per night, had 3.6 hours of recreational screen time per day, and 3.7 hours of physical activity per week.According to the findings, screen time and sleep had the strongest links to improved cognition, and kids with more than two hours of screen time had poorer development.Researchers say parents should manage screen time, and suggest encouraging more physical activity and tech-free zones.]]></description>

      <title>New neuron circuit shows gut has direct link to the brain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA  A new Duke University study has found a new neuron circuit that proves the gut has a more direct connection to the brain than previously thought.Science reports that enteroendocrine cells lining the gut have protrusions similar to neurons, leading researchers to suspect they may be sending signals to the brain via the vagus nerve.When a fluorescent green rabies virus was injected into the colons of mice, the virus labeled the vagus nerve before landing in the brain stem, proving there was a direct circuit.Enteroendocrine cells grown in the same petri dish as vagal neurons connected together and began firing signals. The cells released the neurotransmitter glutamate, involved in conveying senses like taste or smell, which the neurons picked up on within 100 milliseconds.The findings could have massive implications on our understanding of appetite and how to suppress it. Current suppressants target slow-acting hormones, but going after the synapses may in fact be the more effective approach.]]></description>

      <title>Creepy skull-shaped asteroid to pass by Earth for sequel flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  Earth will be having another spooky encounter with a 'death comet' that first swung by our planet three Halloweens ago.Spain's agencia SINC reports that asteroid 2015 TB145 is a skull-like space rock that came within 310,000 miles of Earth on October 31, 2015.Dubbed 'The Great Pumpkin' by NASA due to its Halloween flyby, the asteroid is set to once again pass by our planet on November 11, 2018, but at a much farther distance of 24 million miles.Observations during the first flyby indicate that the asteroid most likely completes a rotation in 2.94 hours, and reflects only 5 to 6% of sunlight, making it just slightly more reflective than charcoal.Astronomers think the asteroid may be an extinct comet that lost its water and other volatile compounds after numerous orbits around the sun.Though the second approach may not be as favorable as the first in terms of distance, scientists say they will still be able to observe and obtain new data on the spooky space rock.]]></description>

      <title>Fruit-heavy diet makes Melbourne Zoo animals fat, rots their teeth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA  Animals at the Melbourne Zoo are dealing with obesity and bad teeth, thanks to a fruit-heavy diet that's chock full of sugar.Fruits may be a vital component to a healthy human diet, according to an Australian government report, but the same cannot be said for animals, who are getting serious problems after a trip on the fruit train, reports the Sydney Morning Herald.The problem is that cultivated fruits have been genetically modified to be sweeter than their wild counterparts.Some, like plums, have nearly double the sugar level nature intended.Animals love the sugary treats, but end up eating only those and nothing else, which not only plumps them up, but also rots their teeth.To save the poor buggers from their sweet tooth, keepers are swapping out the fruit for green leafy veggies. They're also serving up "panda pellets" packed with nutrients and minerals to the red pandas. The pellets are mixed in with a little bit of pear, which gets them the red panda seal of approval.Bottom line is, whether you're human or animal, it's always best to have a balanced diet.]]></description>

      <title>China ramps up expansion of coal-power plants</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA Satellite images show coal power plants across China appear to be expanding and ramping up production.  There was an increase in new coal projects across China at the provincial level between 2014 and 2016, up to 259 gigawatts of coal-energy capacity, according to a study by Coal Swarm.The Chinese government ordered the Huadian Nanxiong coal power plant to be suspended in January 2017, however, two new cooling towers were added in March 2018.Other images show water vapor appearing from cooling towers at the Zhoukou Longda power station in central China, which means the plant is still in operation.At present China has 993 gigawatts of coal power capacity but the new coal projects would lead to a 25 percent increase, according to Coal Swarm.The satellite images show that the central government hasn't been able to control the suspension of more than 100 power plants, with the provincial governments believing the power plants will help boost local economy.According to the lead author of the study, all coal plants would need to be phased out by 2045 to avoid effects of climate change, according to the lead author of the study.]]></description>

      <title>Artificially conceived lions cubs born in South Africa for first time</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA  Researchers at the University of Pretoria have successfully used artificial insemination to birth two lion cubs.According to AFP, researchers collected sperm from a male lion and blood samples from a lioness to determine her hormone levels.After the blood samples indicated it was the correct time, she was artificially inseminated.In the past, lions would have been moved out of their habitat. Using the new method, the lioness was able to stay in her current environment.Scientists are hoping this new method can be repeated in order to save the wild lion population in Africa which has been declining over the last two decades.Lions in 26 African nations are extinct, while those in the wild have plummeted by 43 percent over the past 20 years, according to the International Union for Conservation Nation.Animal welfare groups however argue that lion breeding in South Africa revolves around tourism rather than conservation.]]></description>

      <title>Japanese space rovers send back footage from asteroid</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE   Japan's rovers that successfully landed on an asteroid have sent back their first images.Japan's space agency made history last week as it was the first to ever land robot rovers on an asteroid. The rovers have now sent back high resolution photos of Ryugu's surface.Due to Ryugu's weak gravity, Rover-1A and Rover-1B move around by hopping. Each rover stays in the air for 15 minutes and moves horizontally up to 15 meters with each hop.Rovers-1A and Rover-1B are each equipped with multiple cameras which are now taking stereo images of Ryugu's surface. They have also sent back video of the asteroid's rocky surface.For the next part of the mission, the Hayubusa 2 spacecraft, which deployed the rovers, plans to land on Ryugu by bombing the surface with a missile to create a landing zone for the ship. It will then collect asteroid samples.Scientists involved believe the samples will give us a glimpse into the beginning of the universe.The spacecraft is set to return to Earth by the end of 2020.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists shocked by power of earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SULAWESI, INDONESIA  Scientists have a theory about what might have caused the tsunami that followed the earthquake in Indonesia last week to be so destructive.The 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the center of the island of Sulawesi, triggering 6-meter-tall tsunami waves that crashed in Palu, reports the BBC.The earthquake itself was a strike-slip quake, which means the ground breaks horizontally instead of vertically.Scientists say strike-slip quakes often cause tsunamis that are less than 1 meter tall.Scientists suspect the Indonesia earthquake may have triggered an underwater landslide that destabilized sediment underwater, causing it to break free and tumble.Palu's bay's elongated shape also may have also worked to amplify the effect of the tsunami.The earthquake and the tsunami have already caused substantial damage in Indonesia, with more than 1,000 people confirmed dead and many more trapped under collapsed infrastructure in Sulawesi.]]></description>

      <title>Man rams electric wire up his junk, wire gets knotted in his bladder</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UTTAR PRADESH  An 18-year-old teenager went to the doctor complaining about pain and said he was having trouble taking a leak. When questioned by the doctor, the teen didn't exactly come clean as to why he was in such agony, according to a report published in BMJ Case Reports. It appears the problem was a long piece of electric wire shoved into a hole that should only be letting stuff out. According to the doctors, the teen was playing his own tune by using the wire to clean out his own clarinet. Unfortunately the good times came to an end after the wire became tangled up in his bladder. Surgeons at first tried to yank the wire out, surprisingly that didn't work, so they had to go back in with a laser and blast the wire into pieces. The operation was a success and the teen was discharged from the hospital 24 hours later.]]></description>

      <title>Kavanaugh 'blackout theory' explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C.  As Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues to deny allegations put forth by Christine Blasey Ford, a theory has been presented attempting to reconcile the two competing narratives.The 'blackout theory' suggests both parties are telling the truth, meaning Kavanaugh did in fact assault Ford, but doesn't remember it due to an alcohol-induced blackout.Here, we try to explain the science behind blackouts, and how excessive alcohol intake can affect the memory.Blood alcohol concentration refers to the amount of alcohol present in the bloodstream, measured by the weight of ethanol, in grams, per 100 milliliters of blood.Blackouts can occur when the alcohol level in the blood reaches 0.20, which on average is about 4 drinks for women, and 5 for men, according to a report from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. But to understand how this happens, we need to first look at memory consolidation.In the hippocampus, short-term memories are converted into long-term ones through the persistent strengthening of synapses, a process known as long-term potentiation.These synapses pass signals through neurotransmitters like glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid, or GABA. For a signal to fire, the receiving neuron must have a higher positive charge.Glutamate binds to neuroreceptors and opens it for positive ions, triggering signal firing. GABA, meanwhile, allows in negative ions, which momentarily blocks this action.Alcohol increases GABA activity, causing it to inhibit signals more often and longer than usual. This prolonged depressant effect impacts consolidation, preventing long-term storage of memories.Alcoholic blackouts may be fragmentary, in which memory loss is partial, or en bloc, in which stretches of time are completely missing from a person's memory.Complete blackouts occur around 0.30 BAC. By 0.35, individuals could go into a coma, and at 0.40, the concentration is lethal, typically killing half of all adults who reach it.If anything, the Kavanaugh case at least helps highlight the dangers of too much booze and though it shouldn't be an excuse for crappy behavior, it's not something to be taken lightly, either.]]></description>

      <title>CDC encourages public to get  vaccinated for flu season</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA  The CDC is encouraging the public to get vaccinated for the flu and common cold as flu season typically starts in October.The flu can be caused by three viruses, the influenza A(H1N1) virus, the influenza A(H3N2) virus and the influenza B virus.Symptoms of the flu can include fever, sore throat, and coughing among others.Flu vaccines such as the standard-dose trivalent shot and the quadrivalent shot are administered to protect against the three flu viruses with an additional B virus for the quadrivalent shot.People are encouraged to wear a face mask, wash hands and sneeze into the elbow to prevent the spread of the flu, according to ABC News.Last year's flu season had the highest death toll in more than 40 years, with more than 80,000 people dying from the flu, according to the CDC.The CDC estimates the flu shot reduces the risk of catching the flu by 40 to 60 percent and is encouraging the public to get vaccinated by the end of October.The CDC says everyone above the age of 6 months should receive a shot of the flu vaccine in order to minimize the spread of the virus.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese mega star who went missing is now fined for tax fraud</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  Chinese megastar Fan Bingbing has been fined around $129 million for tax evasion and other charges. According to the BBC, Fan was part of a government probe into how celebrities reported earnings in their contracts. Apparently it's common practice in the land of corruption to use yin-yang contracts   where one contract has the actor's real earnings, and another contract with a lower figure. The contract with the fake earnings is then sent in for taxes. Fan posted a long apology over China's intranet, where she also said, "With the good policies of the party and the state, and without the love of the people, there would be no Fan Bingbing."The Chinese regime has now ordered Fan and the companies she controls to pay the enormous sum in taxes, fines and penalties.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists say a 1.5&#xB0;C increase should be new climate goal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WORLD  Climate scientists are saying that limiting a global temperature rise to a 1.5-degree Celsius increase should be a new target goal.This comes after decades of scientists saying global temperatures must be kept below 2 degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic impacts. According to the BBC, scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, or IPCC, and government officials are meeting in Incheon to see what needs to be done in order to meet the new target. Part of the reason for the change is that small island and low-lying countries were worried that a 2-degree Celsius increase would still lead to their territories being inundated by rising sea levels. Leaked drafts from the IPCC meeting show that a 1.5-degree Celsius increase would have some major differences than a 2.0C increase. Some main points are that 10 million fewer people would lose their homes from rising sea levels. Two million square kilometers of permafrost is saved over centuries. There would be a 50 percent reduction in people across the world experiencing water scarcity. The Arctic would only experience one sea-ice free summers in a century, and there would be a 50 percent reduction in species losing half their geographic range. Unfortunately, according to the leaked drafts, the world has already warmed by about one degree and at the current pace, the 1.5C limit would be surpassed by 2040.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ODENSE, DENMARK  A zoo in Denmark saw some crazy drama unfold after a gay penguin couple kidnapped a chick from its straight parents.NBC reports that according to a zookeeper at the Odense Zoo, mama penguin had gone for her daily swim and left the baby with dad. But it wasn't long before dad too wanted a dip, and had no qualms leaving the little penguin to fend for itself.Seeing the parents were neglectful, a pair of male penguins thought maybe they could do better and took the chick for themselves.The trio were a family for all of one day, before the real parents came looking for their kid and confronted the pair for their baby-snatching. The loud fight was all caught on camera and posted on the zoo's Facebook page. The fellas were definitely not keen on giving up their new kid, so zookeepers eventually had to step in.In the end, mom and dad got their chick back, but the same-sex couple wasn't left high and dry either. They now have an egg from a female unable to care for it, so it's a win-win.Kidnapping may not work in the human, but apparently things pan out when you're a gay penguin couple with a lotta love to give.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SYRACUSE, NEW YORK  Karma has finally come to two Dunkin' Donuts employees who were caught on camera being extra cruel to a homeless man.Syracuse.com reports that the incident happened at a Dunkin' outlet in Syracuse, New York on Sunday night.Jeremy Dufresne had come in to charge his phone and says he put his head down for just a minute when a worker later identified as Shakeen Robbins suddenly dumped a pitcher of cold water on him.Another employee who had been filming the whole thing can be heard laughing as Dufresne hurriedly stands up and grabs his phone.On camera, Robbins tells the man to stop sleeping in the store and to get out, as the clip ends with more laughing from the other staff member.Dufresne is schizophrenic and says he lives outside because he prefers it. He hadn't bothered anyone at the store, and claims the other workers there have been nice to him.The now-viral video has earned the ire of netizens and the local community, who staged a small protest outside the store on Monday. A GoFundMe page set up to help Dufresne and his family has now raised over $21,000  way more than its initial $150 goal.Dunkin' Donuts has since fired the two employees involved in the incident, and say they'll be contacting Dufresne to apologize.Robbins has also come out publicly to say he regrets his actions and wants to make amends.]]></description>

      <title>'Explosive' gender reveal party ends in 47,000-acre wildfire</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GREEN VALLEY, ARIZONA  An off-patrol border agent accidentally started a massive wildfire after his gender reveal stunt went explosively wrong.KGUN 9 reports that last April, Dennis Dickey and his pregnant wife decided to throw a party near Green Valley, Arizona to reveal their baby's gender.The plan had been to shoot at a target containing the explosive substance Tannerite and a colored powder, and have it reveal either blue for a boy, or pink for a girl.But when the shots were fired, it instead set off an explosion that ignited the massive Sawmill fire. Dickey called it in, but the wildfire had already begun spreading far and wide.In total, the 37-year-old's little stunt ended up costing Arizona 47,000 acres of land and $8.2 million. Dickey has since been slapped with a misdemeanor and 5 years probation, and has to fork over $220,000 in restitution.Ironically, despite the whole gender reveal part of the incident, the Dickeys never mentioned if their kid was a boy or a girl.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM  A student union has decided to ban clapping, whooping and cheering and replaced it instead with  wait for it  jazz hands. According to the BBC, student reps from the University of Manchester actually voted to replace clapping with the British Sign Language equivalent  a wave of both hands, so jazz hands. Apparently clapping can trigger students with autism, sensory issues and deafness. Hold up  clapping bothers deaf people? At lively events such as debates, panels and talks, no more will students be subjected to the harsh sounds of audible clapping.According to the student union's liberation and access officer Sara Khan, who proposed the idea, said clapping can "discourage" people from events. Khan said, "I think a lot of the time, even in Parliamentary debates, I've seen that clapping, whooping and talking over each other, loud noises, encourages an atmosphere that is not as respectful as it could be."  Khan said the union was looking to be more inclusive.]]></description>

      <title>Researchers find key to slowing aging process &#x2014; in mice</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA  Researchers have discovered a natural product that can reduce the level of damaged cells in mice caused by aging. Scientists have found that aged mice treated with Fisetin, found in many fruits and vegetables, has significant positive effects on health and lifespan, according to a University of Minnesota Medical School press release.  As people get older, they accumulate damaged cells. As these cells reach a certain level of damage they go through a process known as cellular senescence, whereby they stop dividing. Younger people with healthier immune systems can clear out these damaged cells, but as people age, these cells aren't cleared as effectively. These damaged cells then begin to accumulate and cause low-level inflammation and release enzymes that degrade tissue. Researchers found that Fisetin reduced the level of damaged cells in older mice, and published their findings in the journal EBioMedicine. According to one of the study's authors Paul D. Robbins, "these results suggest that we can extend the period of health, termed healthspan, even towards the end of life." Further research will need to be carried out to see if these results can be reproduced in humans.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists use gene editing to modify rare fruit</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA   Scientists have come up with a way to modify a rare fruit and make it more accessible to the public.Researchers have genetically modified ground cherries to be larger and easier to grow than those found in the wild, according to a study published in Nature Plants.Ground cherries are usually found in South America as well as Central America, and are as small as a marble.The researchers involved described the taste of the fruit as "tropical yet sour" with a slight hint of vanilla.Ground cherries are also referred to as an "orphan crop" as it is grown on a small scale, but are difficult to produce enough to sell commercially as they often fall onto the ground before they are fully ripe.Scientists used CRISPR, a gene editing tool, to target a gene known as CLAVATA 1 to increase the size of the fruit, which resulted in the fruit becoming 25 percent heavier.Scientists also plan to edit the self-pruning gene found in the ground cherry to stop the plants shoots from continuing to grow once the fruit is ripe.The researchers hope this will help make ground cherries more appealing to the public, as well as inspire other scientists to genetically modify other rare fruits.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  A man learned the hard way that drugs have a recommended dosage for a reason, and that ignoring them could be a real eye-opener.According to the case report published in Retinal Cases, the unidentified 31-year-old had gone online and purchased some liquid sildenafil citrate, which is the active ingredient in Viagra.But instead of following the recommended dosage, he chugged the whole bottle down, because if a little bit is good, a lot is better, right? Wrong!Viagra has been known to cause temporary vision issues, even with the typically prescribed dose. So it wasn't long before the man began seeing flashes of light and experiencing sensitivity. His vision also took on a disturbing red tint, prompting him to seek help two days later.Doctors examined his peepers and found that the cells in his retina were permanently damaged. He was diagnosed with retinal toxicity, caused by too much trouser snake enhancing meds.It's been more than a year since, but the unfortunate male is still seeing red despite receiving treatment.Moral of the story, don't go buying random drugs off the internet, and definitely stick to the prescribed dose.]]></description>

According to the BBC, student reps from the University of Manchester actually voted to replace clapping with the British Sign Language equivalent  a wave of both hands, so jazz hands. Apparently clapping can trigger students with autism, sensory issues and deafness. Hold up  clapping bothers deaf people? At lively events such as debates, panels and talks, no more will students be subjected to the harsh sounds of audible clapping.According to the student union's liberation and access officer Sara Khan, who proposed the idea, said clapping can "discourage" people from events. Khan said, "I think a lot of the time, even in Parliamentary debates, I've seen that clapping, whooping and talking over each other, loud noises, encourages an atmosphere that is not as respectful as it could be."  Khan said the union was looking to be more inclusive.]]></description>

      <title>If US was powered only by wind, ground could get warmer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  A new Harvard study simulated the effects of switching the country's entire power grid to wind power to look at the effect turbines have on local temperature. Wind turbines can alter local temperatures by increasing the mixing of air at and above the surface, Ars Technica reports.Researchers Lee Miller and David Keith from Harvard University used a high-resolution climate model of the United States to simulate what would happen if enough wind turbines were placed in the middle third of the country where the winds are highest to meet all current power needs. Their results showed the continental U.S. would get warmer by about 0.2 degrees Celsius on average, while the regions with the wind-turbines would warm by around 0.5 degrees Celsius. The study was published in the journal Joule. The study found that temperature fluctuations are greater at night and smaller during the day because surface warming and Sun driven convection are greater than the effect of the wind turbines. At night when the air is calmer, wind turbines mix warmer air down toward the cooling surface. An important point is that the wind turbines are not generating heat, rather they are moving existing heat around.   Greenhouse gases from fossil fuels on the other hand continually accumulate and last for centuries.]]></description>

      <title>HPV vaccine approved for adults 27 to 45 by FDA</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a human papillomavirus vaccine for adults age 27 to 45. The vaccine was previously approved for people age 9 to 26.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 14 million Americans become infected with HPV every year.  According to an FDA press release, Gardasil 9 prevents certain cancers and diseases caused by nine HPV types. The vaccine protects against Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, which are responsible for a majority of HPV-related diseases.The FDA said it based its expansion on results from a study of 3,200 women age 27 to 45 that found Gardasil 9 was 88 percent effective in prevention of vulvar, vaginal and cervical precancerous lesions, cervical cancer and genital warts caused by the nine HPV types. The vaccine's effectiveness in men  was "inferred" from the data on women, in addition to a clinical trial of 150 men ages 27 to 45 who took a three-dose vaccination over a six-month period. According to the FDA, the safety of Gardasil 9 was evaluated in 13,000  men and women. Common adverse reactions included swelling, redness and pain at the injection site and headache.]]></description>

      <title>China actually has a game show on Xi Jinping's 'teachings'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HUNAN, CHINA  China just dropped the bigliest game show of all time focused on the greatest man to ever walk this earth  Xi Jinping. The show is called "Studying Xi in the New Era" and debuted on Hunan TV, China's second most-watched channel. The CCP has been scheming up new ways to ram propaganda down the throats of young Chinese. Each episode is 40 long minutes and pits three contestants against each other as they dive into the abortion of free thought to talk about Xi's theories and speeches. The first round forces contestants to answer five multiple-choice questions about Xi's policies. The two people with the highest scores proceed to the second round where they are subjected to Xi's speeches and must press a buzzer to get the opportunity to explain what they mean. The final round involves rambling for a minute-and-a-half about who knows what.]]></description>

      <title>Study finds mushroom extract could help save bee population</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA  A vaccine made from two mushroom species, tinder fungus and Red Reishi mushrooms, could be vital in saving the bee population, according to a study published in Scientific Reports.The researchers specifically targeted mycelia, a cobweb-like fungal membrane, found in both the mushrooms to create the vaccine.The team conducted their study with two groups of bees exposed to varroa mites. One group was giving mycelium extract mixed with sugar syrup while the other was only given sugar syrup.The virus levels of the bees were measured and scientists found that those who consumed mycelium extract saw a 45,000-fold reduction in a virus linked to colony collapse disorder, a phenomenon where bee colonies are wiped out.Scientists involved in the study say they believe the vaccine would help support the immune system of the bees and to "allow natural immunity to be strong enough to reduce the viruses."The study comes amid reports of colony collapse disorder leading to the bee population decreasing by at least 30 percent to 90 percent in some areas, according to a report by the Florida Department of Agriculture.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese man angers internet after feeding hippo plastic popcorn bag</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NANCHANG, CHINA  Chinese social media is in a tizzy after a clip surfaced of a zoo visitor being less than kind to the animals.According to Sina News, the incident went down last Wednesday at the Nanchang Zoo in China's Jiangsu Province.A short video shows a man sitting on the barrier of an enclosure, throwing fistfuls of popcorn at a hippo lounging just a few feet away in the water.When its jaws opened wide, the man chucked all of his popcorn  bag and all  straight into its mouth. The animal is seen gulping down the entire thing, which prompts the visitor and the rest of the onlookers to chuckle in delight.Zoo management found about the ghastly behavior the next day, and have filed a report with local police. A vet has since checked the hippo and determined that it's perfectly ok, which, whew.Not sure the same can be said for the uncivilized perp, though, who is probably already being sussed out and shamed online by angry netizens.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[FLORIDA  Hurricane Michael is expected to intensify and is forecast to hit the Florida Panhandle as a Category 3 by midweek. According to CBS News, Florida and Alabama have both declared states of emergency. According to the National Hurricane Center, Michael could strengthen into a Category 3 and higher, meaning it will have sustained winds of over 111 miles per hour, by Tuesday night before making contact with the Panhandle on Wednesday.According to the Weather Channel, this will be due to a combination of favorable upper-level winds and above-average sea-surface temperatures along Michael's path.  According to the Weather Channel, storm surge, damaging winds and heavy rains are likely to affect areas along the northeastern Gulf Coast. Storm surge flooding of 8 to 12 feet is expected to occur along the immediate coastline near and east of where the center makes landfall. According to CBS News, Florida Governor Rick Scott has added 700 more Florida National Guards troops to aide in storm preparation and response, bringing the total to well over 1,000.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ALASKA  It down to the final day of voting for brown bears living along the Brooks River at Katmai National Park & Reserve as they fight to be the fattest in the fourth annual Fat Bear Week.According to ABC 13, park rangers are tracking bears often seen on the explore.org Bear Cam as they stuff their faces in preparation for hibernation in March Madness-style brackets. Alaskan brown bears start packing on the pounds in July. According to the National Park Service, bears enter a state known as hyperphagia where they eat non-stop and can fatten up to four pounds in a single day  so basically a normal 'Murican diet. Some bears can devour dozens of sockeye salmon in one day, with each salmon providing around 4,000 calories. Bears supersize themselves in preparation for hibernation and can lose up to a third of their body fat during the five to eight month slumber.People can watch the big old bears on Katmai's Facebook page and get to vote until October 9, after which the winner will be crowned.]]></description>

      <title>Climate report calls for immediate action against climate change</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SOUTH KOREA  A report from the U.N. scientific panel on climate changes urged governments around the world to take immediate action to avoid disastrous levels of temperature rise.The authors of the report found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the temperature of Earth's atmosphere would increase about 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040, according to The New York Times.Previously, scientists believed the damage would occur if average temperatures were to rise above 2 degrees Celsius.However, the reports warns the increase of just 1.5 degree Celsius would flood coastlines as well as intensify droughts around the planet.In order to prevent 1.5 degrees of warming, pollution caused by greenhouse gases would have to be slashed by 45 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050.By 2050, use of different sources of renewable energy such as wind and solar power would have to increase to 67 percent while use of coal would have to decrease by nearly 40 percent.Drew Shindell, author of the report, said "there is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal."The report warned of irreversible damage such as coral reefs dying off if we fail to take action to prevent this catastrophe.]]></description>

      <title>China used tiny microchip to hack Apple, Amazon servers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  Apple and Amazon have become the subject of intense speculation after a new report claims their servers were infiltrated by Chinese spy chips.According to a Bloomberg investigative report, a Chinese military unit planted microchips the size of a pencil tip into motherboards while they were on the production line in China.The compromised hardware was supplied to Supermicro Computer in San Jose, California, and inserted into servers that were then used by almost 30 U.S. companies, including Apple and Amazon.With the microchips, Chinese hackers had access to the companies' data centers, allowing them to steal information, connect with other servers, and alter operations.U.S. intelligence services allegedly found out about the chip in 2015, around the same time that Apple and Amazon discovered the breach on their servers.However, Supermicro, Apple, and Amazon have denied the claims made in the report. The Department of Homeland Security also came out saying it has no reason to doubt the companies' statements.A follow-up Bloomberg report points to 'new evidence' from a telecom company, where a similar microchip was found embedded in the Ethernet connector of servers sourced from Supermicro.Experts say hardware hacks are a legitimate concern, and are far more devastating and hard to detect than software-based incidents.Still, most seem to be divided on the validity of the Bloomberg expose and may stay that way until actual concrete evidence  like an actual microchip  somehow surfaces.]]></description>

      <title>Hubble telescope in safe mode after gyroscope failure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA  NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has gone into safe mode after two of its four functioning gyroscopes stopped working.The Hubble had been operating with four of its six gyroscopes when two of them failed, according to reports from NASA.At any given time, the Hubble needs at least three of its gyroscopes to work for optimal efficiency.After one of the gyroscopes failed, controllers tried to switch to another newer gyroscope, however, that one failed as well, leaving the Hubble with only two fully functioning gyroscopes.Gyroscopes are mainly used to make steer the Hubble and makes sure the telescope is steady in space.The failure was "not unexpected" as two other gyros of the same model had already experienced problems, according to a NASA statement.NASA also tweeted it was conducting tests on the newer gyroscope to determine the problems.The operators will now try to revive the newer gyroscope and bring it online. If it is not successful, the Hubble will operate in a "reduced-gyro" mode, using only one gyro in order to let the telescope operate for a longer time.However, this would affect the Hubble's ability to track fast moving objects as well as reduce the amount of sky it can view in any given moment, according to NASA.]]></description>

      <title>Artificial sweeteners may not be good for your gut</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEERSHEBA, ISRAEL / ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA  In recent years, sugar has become public enemy number one as far as health is concerned, prompting people to turn to artificial sweeteners. But are they really any better for you?Science Daily reports that researchers from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel and Nanyang Technological Institute in Singapore modified E. coli to light up when exposed to toxins, using it as a sensing model representative of the complex gut microbial system.Exposure to six types of popular artificial sweeteners, which include aspartame and sucralose among others, had a toxic, stressing effect that made it difficult for the bacteria to grow and reproduce.A separate study carried out in Australia looked at 29 healthy adults and randomly administered the capsule equivalent of drinking 1.5 liters of diet soda a day to fourteen of the participants. The other fifteen were given a placebo, according to a report in Diabetologia.After two weeks, the amount of good bacteria in the fourteen subjects' gut had decreased, while gut pathogens had increased  potentially affecting the body's ability to regulate glucose.But while both studies' findings are compelling, experts say they are insufficient to establish causality. It's also it's difficult to assess what exactly these gut marker changes mean to overall health, which means the verdict is still out on whether these sugar substitutes are in fact harmful.]]></description>

      <title>US-China tensions in the South China Sea explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C. / BEIJING  A dangerously close encounter in disputed waters has become the latest flashpoint in worsening Sino-American relations.The South China Morning Post reports that on September 30, the USS Decatur was sailing near China-claimed Gaven Reef in the South China Sea's Spratly Islands when it was approached by a Chinese ship.The PRC destroyer Luyang reportedly came within 45 yards of the American vessel's bow, prompting it to maneuver to prevent a collision.The South China Sea has long been a site of conflict, not just for the U.S. and China, but for many countries in the region, whose overlapping claims on disputed waters are based on their Exclusive Economic Zones. In contrast, China purports to own 90% of the South China Sea based on historic rights, using a nebulous "9-dash line" to back its territorial claim.As a way to legitimize and safeguard their alleged territory, the Chinese have built up and fortified artificial islands in the Spratlys, effectively creating a network of military bases.Though the U.S. has no stake in the disputed waters, it has repeatedly challenged China's maritime claims through freedom of navigation operations, resulting in several altercations over the years.American and Japanese ships held joint military exercises in the contested region as recently as September. Weeks later, U.S. bombers flew through the area twice in three days.China typically condemns these maneuvers and often responds with air and naval drills showcasing their own military might.Following the USS Decatur incident, a U.S. Navy proposal suggests a large military exercise in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait as a global show of force to warn China, reports CNN.The conflict comes amidst a brewing trade war between the two nations, with the U.S. imposing tariffs on imported Chinese goods, and China retaliating by doing the same.Vice President Mike Pence further fanned the flames after complimenting Taiwan's democratic stance and recommending that Beijing take a page from their book.China is especially sensitive about Taiwan, which it sees as a renegade province, and has consistently slammed any efforts to support the island's sovereignty.Analysts say escalating tensions between the world's two largest superpowers are likely to persist, reports the Economic Times, but it's unclear whether they may get resolved somewhere down the line or lead to a global-scale conflict.]]></description>

      <title>Chernobyl has started up again, this time as a solar power plant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHERNOBYL, UKRAINE  Ukraine has just unveiled a solar power plant just 100 meters from Chernobyl's nuclear site in which a nuclear disaster occurred 30 years ago.The power plant will consist of photovoltaic solar panels to produce energy and will be connected to the power grid, according to a Reuters report.Ukraine plans to diversify its energy sources by using renewable energy such as solar power.About 3,800 panels will be installed and will produce enough energy to power 2,000 apartments.The Chernobyl Solar Power Plant currently has a capacity of one megawatt but there are plans to eventually increase it to 100 megawatts.Chernobyl's nuclear site exploded in 1986 and forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate the contaminated area which resulted in the area being abandoned due to radiation.Humans aren't allowed to live in the area for another 24,000 years, according to AFP.]]></description>

      <title>Cops called on black man babysitting white kids</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARIETTA, GEORGIA  It's 2018 and black people still can't seem do anything without raising some eyebrows, not even watching some friend's kids.Corey Lewis found that out firsthand, despite being a fine, upstanding citizen and running his own after-school youth mentoring program.CBS 46 reports that on Sunday, he and the two white kids he was babysitting were in a Walmart parking lot when some crazy lady decided to get all up in their business.The woman had initially pulled up in a sedan asking if the kids were okay, then came back again wanting to talk to them. When Lewis refused, she flipped and threatened to take down his plate.The lady went on to trail him for about an hour, following him to the gas station across the street, and then all the way back to his house.As if that wasn't enough, she then called the cops and reported his behavior as 'suspicious.'A Cobb County police officer showed up and talked to Lewis and the kids, and soon confirmed what everyone already knew  everything was okay. The cop did call the kids' parents, who were pretty dumbfounded about the whole ordeal.Lewis, meanwhile, is trying to obtain the 911 record and find out the woman's identity and why she did what she did. Well  it doesn't take a genius to figure that out.]]></description>

      <title>Catch-and-release may be harmful to fish</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA  Hook injuries caused by the catch and release method may actually be harmful to fish, study finds. The catch-and-release method is common in recreational fishing, with most people opting to use barbless hooks to reduce the harm caused to the fish.According to a UC Riverside study, fishing hooks cause injuries to the mouth of fish which in turn affects their ability to capture prey.When the hook is removed, it leaves behind a hole in the mouth, according to the study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.Researchers explained the hole disrupts the suction feeding system, creating negative pressure in the mouth relative to the water as the fish open their mouths to suck in their prey.Scientists captured ten shiner perch using a hook and line and ten others using a net.The captured fish were observed using high-speed cameras. Those with mouth injuries were found to have difficulty sucking prey into their mouths.However, a researcher involved with the study said that further studies are needed to determine the long term effects of hook-related injuries on fish.]]></description>

      <title>Why the Brazilian butt lift is such a deadly procedure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A UK plastic surgery organization has warned members not to perform Brazilian butt lifts, after a second British woman died from the procedure this year.The surgery is immensely popular, despite having the highest death rate of all cosmetic procedures, according to a statement from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But what exactly makes it so dangerous?Brazilian butt lifts or BBL involve taking excess fat from other parts of the body, such as the stomach and back, and injecting it into the glutes to enhance them.The procedure carries a large risk of fat cells being mistakenly injected into large veins and going into the bloodstream. This can lead to a fat embolism, which can block blood vessels in the heart, lungs, or brain and cause death.Other complications that can stem from BBL include bacterial infections, wound ruptures, and necrosis, among others.Experts say many patients who have suffered botched surgeries had the procedure done abroad where it's cheaper.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[US  Virgin Galactic is all set to launch its latest SpaceShipTwo, the VSS Unity. The ship is designed to carry two crew members as well as six passengers.However, tickets for the spacecraft do not come cheap. People have paid upwards of $250,000 for a seat, according to Digital Trends.The VSS Unity will first be taken into space with a carrier aircraft called the WhiteKnight Two, according to the Guardian.Once the spacecraft reaches a certain altitude, the VSS Unity will be "dropped" by the carrier aircraft, which is when its rocket engines fire up.The VSS Unity will have to reach heights of 100 km in order to reach space.Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Galactic, told CNBC he is confident that they would be in space "within weeks, not months."]]></description>

      <title>Chinese tourists grab swan by the neck after missed photo op</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LUCERNE, SWITZERLAND  In yet another instance of Chinese tourists behaving badly, a couple of photo-obsessed aunties were caught on camera mercilessly manhandling a swan in Switzerland.The South China Morning Post reports that the footage was shot near Swan Square in Lucerne, and begins with some Chinese tourists crowding around a large swan.Despite a sign saying not to feed them, one lady used a paper napkin to bait a bird, presumably for a photo op.When the swan snatched the paper from her hand, another woman grabbed the animal by the neck and tried to take back the napkin.Someone in the group can be heard complaining about not getting the shot, prompting Chinese news reports to speculate that the attack stemmed from a missed photo op.Video of the tourists was shared on Snapchat, before being picked up by a Swiss news outlet, and needless to say, most people were disgusted with the women's behavior.]]></description>

The woman notified Frontier Airlines that she would be bringing an emotional support animal on the flight. She just didn't inform them that her emotional support is a squirrel, according to USA Today.When she tried to bring the squirrel along with her, Frontier told her rodents, including squirrels, were not permitted. She was then asked to get off the plane, however she refused, so Orlando airport police had to be called. All the passengers were then forced to deplane. After throwing a tantrum she was wheeled out of the gate in a wheelchair with her squirrel to cheers from the passengers.]]></description>

      <title>What we know so far about Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ISTANBUL  Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi has been missing for more than 10 days, prompting speculation that he'd been dispatched by his own government.Khashoggi's fiancee Hatice Cengiz told the New York Times that he had tried to obtain a document on September 28 for their upcoming wedding, but was told by the consulate in Turkey that he had to come back to collect it.On October 2, nine Saudi officials and intelligence officers arrived in Istanbul via private jet, booking three nights at two hotels near the mission. Around 12:13, vehicles allegedly carrying some of the agents arrived outside the Saudi consulate.Jamal Khashoggi entered the consulate at 1:14 p.m. after leaving his two phones with his Cengiz, telling her to get help if he didn't come back out.A Turkish source told the Middle East Eye that shortly after Khashoggi was led into the consul-general's room, two Saudi agents entered and dragged him out. The 59-year-old was taken into another room and later killed. His body was then dismembered with a bone saw in a third room.Six vehicles carrying the Saudi officials reportedly left the consulate around 4 p.m., while two others drove to the consul's residence nearby, one of them believed to be carrying Khashoggi.A second jet carrying six more officials arrived past 5, though it departed an hour later for Cairo, and then Riyadh. The first jet left later that night, stopping at Dubai before returning to the Kingdom the next day.Cengiz waited outside the consulate until 1 a.m., but never saw Khashoggi emerge. She returned again the following day when he still hadn't reappeared.Turkey has been quick to point the finger at the Saudis, telling the U.S. that they have audio and video recordings proving Khashoggi was killed.Turkish newspaper Sabah claims Khashoggi's Apple Watch recorded his ordeal inside the consulate and sent it to his phone and iCloud, though many have questioned whether this is technically feasible.Turkish officials allegedly want to use luminol to check for blood inside the mission, but the Saudis have only allowed a visual probe. The Middle East Eye reports that the prosecutor general is considering digging up the garden of the Saudi consul-general's residence to see if Khashoggi's remains are there.Riyadh called the allegations baseless and claim the journalist left the consulate through the back, though no evidence has surfaced backing this claim.They denied sending a team to Istanbul on October 2, even as Sabah published the images and details of the 15 Saudi operatives believed to be involved in the case. According to information corroborated by the New York Times, one of the men is an autopsy expert at the Saudi Interior Ministry, while another is an Air Force lieutenant.]]></description>

      <title>Some dietary pills found to contain unapproved drugs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S. A total of 776 over-the-counter dietary supplements were found to contain potentially harmful drugs.According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, 97.6 percent of the ingredients present in supplements were not labeled on the products.Eighty-six percent of the contaminated drugs were mainly found in supplements labeled as drugs for weight loss and sexual enhancement, while 12 percent were found in muscle building supplements.One in five supplements were found to contain more than one pharmaceutical drug.Sildenafil, the active ingredient for Viagra, was the most common drug found in sexual enhancement supplements while sibutramine, a weight-loss drug banned by the FDA, was found in weight loss supplements.Dr. Louis Aronne, a professor of metabolic research, told Reuters that dietary supplements are hard to regulate as they are often sold and marketed online.Less than half of the contaminated supplements were ever recalled from stores, according to Scientific American.The FDA can issue a warning and ask the company to voluntarily recall their products, however the FDA can't force the companies to do so as dietary supplements aren't regulated like other medication, according to Forbes.]]></description>

Sure she's a little nuts, but that's why it's fun.Whether you're into Marvel or DC, cosplaying your favorite superhero is always fun. Black Panther is top notch, as is Wonder Woman. It'll be super cold in that costume, but at least you'll slay.Johnny Depp may have moved on from Jack Sparrow, but pirates never go out of style  that's why they're at number eight. Bonus points if you can drink like one too.Rabbits have taken over the ninth spot, though we're not sure who's more proud  Bugs Bunny or Regina George.Finally, we can't have a Halloween without someone dressing up as a princess. With two royal weddings this year, you can bet all the Meghan Markles will be taking to the streets.There are more costumes ranked on Frightgeist, as well as a costume map showing which ones are popular in which areas. Whatever you decide to be, just make sure you're ready by the 31st. Halloween waits for no one.]]></description>

      <title>Mechanic accidentally destroys F-16 fighter jet in Belgium</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FLORENNES, BELGIUM  A mechanic servicing a fighter jet at a Belgian air base accidentally opened fire destroying an F-16. Talk about a bad day at work. According to Scramble Magazine, while the technician was working on an F-16 in the hangar at the Florennes Air Base, he accidentally activated the jet's six-barrel 20mm Vulcan cannon and popped off a few rounds last Thursday. Unfortunately for the technician, another F-16 was sitting outside the hangar and was fueled in preparation for an afternoon sortie.  The 20 millimeter shells caused the F-16 to immediately catch fire and explode, completely destroying the aircraft. Two other F-16s were also damaged. Luckily no one was killed, although two mechanics were treated for some hearing loss. According to the Telegraph, around 30 firefighters rushed to the scene along with other emergency crew. An investigation has been opened into the incident.]]></description>

      <title>How Saudi Arabia can retaliate against sanctions over Khashoggi</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA  U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened Saudi Arabia with severe punishment if it's proven that they are behind the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.In response, the Saudis have vowed to carry out retaliatory measures that could potentially spark a "global economic disaster", according to an editorial by Al Arabiya general manager Turki Aldhakhil.The Guardian reports that Saudi Arabia is the world's largest exporter of oil, shipping over 7 million barrels a day worldwide. If they were to halt sales, oil prices could skyrocket from $80 per barrel to over $400.This would not only drive up the global cost of petrol, but also any goods that are transported by land, including basic commodities.As a major importer of U.S. arms, the Kingdom benefits American companies and jobs. But a freeze in U.S.-Saudi relations could jeopardize this and see the Saudis buy from other arms exporters like Russia or China.Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is also set to invest over $20 billion in U.S. infrastructure  an agreement which could fall through in the event of a diplomatic standoff.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  A Brooklyn woman is getting roasted by the interwebs after she accused a black kid of touching her inappropriately.The New York Post reports that Teresa Klein, dubbed Corner store Caroline by shookt netizens, went berserk at a deli in Flatbush, New York last Wednesday after a 9-year-old boy supposedly got handsy with her.Video taken at the scene shows Klein calling the cops, screaming that the child grabbed her backside, and causing the boy and his sister to burst into tears.Bystanders were quick to jump to the kid's defense, and repeatedly told the crazy white lady to go home.Neighbors say Klein is notorious for terrorizing residents, and likes to abuse the police hotline for the littlest things.On Friday, Corner store Caroline apologized after watching the surveillance video which showed it was the kid's backpack and not his hand that grazed her.Still, Klein says she still wants to pursue charges against the kid's mom for supposedly being aggressive and threatening her life.This from a woman who self-identifies as a humanist, feminist, and Buddhist?

      <title>Healthy mice made from same-sex 
parents for the first time</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  Scientists in China have successfully used gene editing and stem cell techniques to produce mice with two mothers.The researchers used cells called haploid embryonic stem cells which contained half of the usual number of chromosomes from one mouse and took DNA from another, according to a study published in the journal Cell Stem Cell.The scientists then used Crispr-Cas9 to delete the imprinting from three regions of the DNA by cutting out a single letter of the genetic code which made the genetic material appear more "male."Without the correct pattern of male and female imprinting, a viable embryo cannot be produced.The embryonic stem cells were then injected into the eggs of a different female mouse which then developed into embryos. This produced 29 live mice from 210 embryos.The researchers also tried the same technique on two male mice. It involved cutting off seven imprintings from the DNA of the male mouse instead of three from the female mouse.The embryo from the male mouse was successfully created, however the baby mouse  only survived for 48 hours after birth.The scientists say the mice were healthy and went on to have mice of their own.The author of the study said this technique would be ten times more difficult for humans and primates.]]></description>

      <title>Woman fired after refusing man entry into his own building</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. LOUIS  A Missouri woman's entitlement was on full display Saturday, when she tried to stop a black man from entering his own apartment complex.Fox reports that D'Arreion Toles had been returning home to his loft in downtown St. Louis when a woman walking her dog parked herself in front of the door and wouldn't budge.A series of videos taken at the scene shows Toles asking the woman, later identified as Hilary Brooke Mueller, repeatedly to please move, but she only asks if he's a resident.When he confirms he lives in the building, she then demands his apartment number, refusing to let him through when he won't tell, saying she's uncomfortable.And yet even after he moves past, she kept on following him  into the elevator and all the way to his unit. She seems to back off after he unlocks his front door, and does a weird 180 claiming to want to meet him because he's a neighbor.The encounter should have ended with Toles shutting his door. But Mueller took it a step further by calling police, who came 30 minutes later asking about the incident.The videos were posted to Facebook and have since gotten millions of views, and even more online hate directed at Hallway Hillary.Her employers weren't too happy with her racially profiling her neighbor either, and have since fired her over the disturbing video.Well, you know what they say about karma.]]></description>

      <title>UAE plans to build Mars training city here on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED ARAB EMIRATES  The United Arab Emirates is planning to build a Mars training city here on Earth.The US$136 million dollar project will be called Mars Science City and consists of interconnected dome structures that span 1.9 million square feet, around the size of two Alcatraz Islands, according to Science Alert.According to Popular Science, the city will be used by engineers to prototype future Mars building materials and construction techniques. It will also house labs that can simulate various parts of Mars' environment. Researchers will practice several methods of farming on light resources as Mars lacks water and nutritious soil. Waste and water recycling methods will also be tested. With Mars radiation being stronger than on Earth, the domes will be used to test material that can block solar radiation. The domed city will also be able to filter in more or less sunlight, possibly to better mirror Mars time. The UAE plans to have a team of people live in the city for a year to develop strategies for surviving long-term on the Red Planet. Besides laboratories, the proposed city will also contain a museum dedicated to space achievements.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  Apparently some Chinese tourists thought it was a great idea to ignore barriers and jump into a sea of flowers to take selfies. Photos published by Chinese media outlets show the tourists entering the area to sit and lie down for photos, flattening the grass while doing so.A woman surnamed Zheng, reportedly a caretaker of the park, said it "broke her heart" when she saw the tourists destroying the grass just for a few selfies.Her voice turned hoarse from yelling at the ill-mannered tourists, according to the South China Morning Post.She told local reporters she felt like her child was being bullied but she couldn't do anything to stop it.She added that the rare pink grass was imported from Australia and took three years for them to tend it.However it only took two weeks for the selfie-seeking tourists to destroy the pretty pink grass, which typically is able to last for at least two months.She said even though the pictures the tourists took must be pretty, they have ugly behavior.Zheng said they were left with no choice but to cut the grass down in order to ensure the pink grass has a chance to bloom again next year.]]></description>

      <title>What weapons are the U.S. selling Saudi Arabia?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C. / RIYADH  The disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi has prompted angry lawmakers to call for a halt to a $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia.Reuters reports that U.S. President Donald Trump is reluctant to block the package, saying it would hurt American jobs, even as critics dispute its actual worth since it's not based on actual signed contracts.White House officials told The National Interest that the list of weapons to be sold to the Saudis are still being finalized, although agreements released by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency provide a partial list. According to these agreements, Saudi Arabia is buying 48 CH-47 Chinook helicopters, 10 Persistent Threat Detection Aerostats, P-8 Poseidon aircrafts, and C-130 Hercules transport planes.Land-based weaponry included in the deal include 133 M1A2S Abrams tanks, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, and the $13-billion THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system.As part of their naval modernization program, the Kingdom is getting four Multi-Mission Surface Combatant frigates and 48 Harpoon Block II missiles, among others.The Saudis are also buying Standoff Land Attack Missiles, the medium-range Joint Standoff Weapon, and about $63 million worth of artillery shells.Several U.S. weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have released statements announcing the deals, but are reportedly still awaiting details from the government.]]></description>

      <title>Elk hunter survives grizzly attack thanks to some bear spray</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOZEMAN, MONTANA  An elk hunter is thanking his  well, his friend's  bear spray after it saved him from a grizzly attack on Saturday in Gallatin National Forest. Bob Legasa and his hunting partner, Greg Gibson, were moving toward some elk when he heard a growl, according to Legasa's Facebook post. It was a 2-year-old cub and its mother only about 12 yards away from a tree. After the cub growled, it moved over and that's when the mother charged. Legasa didn't have time to reach his bear spray. The grizzly bit his hand, breaking a bone in his arm, and clawed at his face. That's when Gibson rushed over and discharged bear spray into the grizzly's face, which caused her to let go. Legasa pulled out his own spray, but ended up macing himself instead  doh. Gibson then discharged his spray again, but the wind blew it back into his eyes. The bears ran off as both men were temporarily blinded by their own sprays. Funny thing is that three weeks earlier, the duo made a bear spray safety video for Gibson's Montana Guide Service, according to Legasa in an AP phone interview.

      <title>China to launch artificial moon into space in two years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHENGDU, CHINA  Officials in China are planning to launch an illumination satellite in the southwestern city of Chengdu within the next two years.The man-made moon will have a reflective coating on its surface to reflect light from the sun, according to Asia Times.It also will have solar panel-like wings on its surface which can be adjusted for precise lighting.The satellite will reportedly be eight times brighter than the real moon and could replace street lights.The artificial moon would be able to light an area of up to 10 to 80 kilometers in diameter, giving a dusk-like hue to complement the real moon in the sky.Officials in the city hope the artificial moon will bring in more tourists once it is in the sky.However some members of the public are reportedly worried the man-made moon might have an adverse effect on animals and astronomical observation.]]></description>

      <title>Latin American coffee supply threatened by fungus outbreak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANTIGUA, GUATEMALA  A fungus outbreak is threatening to wipe out Latin American coffee crops and trigger a global coffee crisis.According to the American Phytopathological Society, coffee rust is a disease caused by the fungus hemileia vastatrix, which is characterized by half-smooth spores.Infections usually start on the lowermost leaves of a coffee plant, where the fungus protrude through the stomata on the undersides of leaves.The disease causes powdery yellow-orange lesions to appear on the bright green leaves, making them turn a brownish yellow tinge. These lesions produce more spores, which spread by wind or rain to infect others.Though the fungus doesn't kill coffee plants, it debilitates them by causing leaves to fall out. With its nutrition source gone, the plant is unable to produce coffee cherries.Coffee rust currently has no cure, and while copper-based fungicides have proven effective in controlling infection, chemicals can accumulate and become toxic to the environment.Scientists have also turned to genetic resistance, cross-breeding the rust-susceptible Arabica with a natural hybrid immune to the disease to create a more rust-resistant variety.The resulting beans, though not as high quality as the Arabica, were at least good enough to be accepted by growers and buyers, according to the BBC.However, the World Coffee Research has warned that the fungus is evolving, and may overcome once-immune genes in five to ten years. As of 2017, the Honduran Lempira was no longer resistant, and the natural Timor Hybrid's resistance is also breaking down.Coffee rust had previously wiped out crops in present-day Sri Lanka during the late 1800s. But while that region bounced back by switching to tea production, it's unlikely Latin America will be able to do the same.]]></description>

      <title>Kanye West's idea to redesign Air Force One as an iPlane</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA  Kanye West has proposed a plan to replace the Air Force One with an iPlane 1.The original design of the iPlane 1 was created by Shabtai Hirshberg and consists of a jet with a wide, flat body and a transparent roof.As seen on the self-promotion portfolio site Behance, where Hirshberg publicized his design, the jet would have wings that would be able to turn up and down while taking off and landing.It would also potentially be able to take off and land using a standard runway or in water. It would also use a hybrid engine to ensure the plane flies quietly in the sky.There would also be a docking area for the jets in the water when they are not in use.However, the jet was not initially designed to be powered by hydrogen.Hirshberg told The Verge he is currently working with a group to develop a smaller, jet-sized version of his original concept.He also added he wouldn't mind collaborating with Kanye West and Apple if they actually decide to take the idea forward.]]></description>

      <title>Google completely sells out with China Dragonfly search engine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA  Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed this week the company has decided to kowtow to Beijing by building and testing a censored search engine. First reported by The Intercept in August, Google's "Project Dragonfly" would block search results for queries the Chinese regime deems sensitive. So terms like human rights, democracy, religion, peaceful protests, and of course Taiwan would all be censored, in addition to all the other silly things the Chinese government gets their feelings hurt over.  Pichai announced the massive sell out at Wired's 25th anniversary summit in San Francisco. Pichai claims a censored Google search engine could serve over 99 percent of queries in China. Unfortunately, for a country with 1.3 billion people, that remaining 1 percent could still be astronomical number.According to CNBC, the CEO said that in any country that Google operates, it must balance its values  "providing users access to information, freedom of expression and user privacy"  with obeying the local laws. Well, since Beijing values absolutely none of those things, that's really not much of a balancing act, is it?  What's even more interesting is that while Google decided not to renew a Pentagon AI drone deal because of staff backlash, it's more than willing to ignore staff protest this time around. Pichai claims it is still "very early" and that Google hasn't decided yet if it's going to roll out Dragonfly in China.]]></description>

      <title>Man dies from rare brain disease after eating squirrel brains</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ROCHESTER, NEW YORK  A hunter in New York died from a rare mad cow-like disease he may have contracted from eating squirrel brains.Miami Herald reports that the 61-year-old man was taken to a hospital in Rochester, New York after suffering from impaired walking and thinking.An MRI revealed that the man's brain looked similar to those with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is caused by infectious proteins called prions and tied to the consumption of contaminated beef.Prion build-up in the cells rapidly deteriorates the brain, causing it to shrink, and tiny holes to appear in the tissues  making it look like a sponge.The disease is fatal, with patients typically dying within a year of showing symptoms.The Rochester patient met a similar fate, and died five months after being diagnosed with the infection in 2015.Doctors found out from his family that the man liked to hunt, and believe he may have contracted Creutzfeldt-Jakob from eating squirrels' brains.Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is extremely rare. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are only four confirmed cases in the U.S.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[AGUILA. ARIZONA  An Arizona man is in good condition after being rescued from a mine shaft he was stuck in for two days.ABC 15 reports that John Waddell had plummeted into the 100-foot deep shaft on Monday, after telling a friend he was going over there.The 62-year-old broke both legs during the fall, and quickly realized he wasn't alone in the shaft  there were rattlesnakes slithering all around him.He managed to kill three of the serpents during the 48 hours he was there, all while screaming for help.Waddell had a deal with his friend Terry Schrader, to come look for him if he wasn't back by Tuesday. Schrader drove to the shaft Wednesday, and immediately heard Waddell hollering for help.He called deputies, and a rescue team eventually managed to pull the man out to safety some six hours later. Despite broken bones and severe dehydration, Waddell's injuries weren't life-threatening. Still, the chap is lucky to be alive.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[U.S.A  The CDC has confirmed the rise of acute flaccid myelitis, also known as polio-like disease.Acute flaccid myelitis is a disease that causes drooping eyelids,difficulty with eye movement, loss of muscle tone, decreased reflexes along with other symptoms, according to the CDC.The disease mainly affects children and could potentially paralyze a child's arms and/or legs.Doctors typically diagnose the disease by examining the patient's nervous system or by conducting an MRI and looking at the patient's brain and spinal cord.As there is no specific treatment for acute flaccid myelitis, officials recommend physical therapy for muscle weakness, washing hands and staying up to date on vaccines.This year alone, more than half of all the states in the U.S. have confirmed possible cases of the polio-like disease.Officials are also unsure how the disease spreads and is encouraging parents to seek medical care immediately if their child has sudden weakness in their arms or legs.]]></description>

      <title>Divers swim 90 feet into sewage tank to remove massive fatberg</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA  A team of lucky divers were tasked with the job of plunging 90 feet into sewage tanks to remove a big old fatberg.According to ABC 7, the Charleston Water System dumped the news over social media last week that specialized divers at the Plum Island Wastewater Treatment Center had to be sent into a wet well to unclog a bunch of pumps backed up by a huge mass of flushed wet wipes. The divers had to make their way through 90 feet of raw sewage with zero visibility and find the source of the blockage with only their hands. And what did they find waiting for them? A massive fatberg of baby wipes, oil, fat, grease, tampons, string, hair and makeup pads. According to officials, the biggest culprit in the fatberg was definitely the wet wipes.  It took the divers several fun-filled trips to extract the massive clumps of sewage-soaked wipes and clear the pumps. According to the utility, the operation took several days of around-the-clock work to get everything moving again. For a reward, the divers were treated to a proper hosing down from head to toe with bleach. According the Charleston Water, the only things you should be flushing are #1, #2 and toilet paper. Words of wisdom to live by.]]></description>

      <title>Pando, world's largest organism, is in danger of collapsing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UTAH  The Pando aspen clone located in Fishlake National Forest in Utah is considered to be the world's largest living organism, but a recent study has found it is dying out. According to a new study published on Wednesday in PLOS One by Utah State University researchers Paul Rogers, Ph.D. and Darren McAvoy, Ph.D., the Pando is in danger of collapse. According to Inverse, Pando is a massive grove of 47,000 genetically identical stems growing from a single underground root system of a quaking aspen tree that covers an area of 107 acres. According to Forbes, aspens have the ability to produce clones through offshoots from their root system and are able to colonize large areas of land through the root system. The new study found that the Pando has been declining in size for decades and has not been able to replace dying aspens. The scientists found that a combination of grazing animals, like mule deer and cattle, and human encroachment have led to the Pando collapse. The researchers found that protective fencing was effective at protecting the Pando. In order to survive long term, Rogers told the New York Times, that more thorough fencing would be required, along with culling some deer and making sure cattle don't graze in the grove.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ISTANBUL  Saudi Arabia has finally admitted that Jamal Khashoggi is dead, but have so far given conflicting accounts about what went down.Fortunately, surveillance footage and Turkish intelligence info have helped piece together what really happened to the Saudi journalist and dissident. Here's what we know now.The New York Times reports that on October 2, Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul through the front entrance at 1:14 p.m.According to a person close to Turkish president Erdogan, Khashoggi was attacked within two minutes of entering. He was dead within seven minutes, and dismembered within 22 minutes.Newly leaked footage now shows that the Saudis employed a body double to put on a fake beard and wear the deceased Khashoggi's clothes as part of a cover-up. Reports suggested that the body double, identified as 57-year-old Mustafa al-Madani, is an intelligence agent, though his main qualification seems to be that he was of similar height, age, and build to Khashoggi.  Madani was captured on camera strolling the streets of Istanbul with an accomplice, but was recognized as an imposter due to his different shoes.Khashoggi's body, meanwhile, has yet to be found. Saudi officials claim they don't know the location of his remains, only saying it was rolled in a rug before being handed to a local accomplice.A pro-government Turkish newspaper reported that on the day of the killing, a member of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's entourage made four calls to his office and one to the U.S., adding to speculation that he ordered the act.Turkish intelligence sources also told Reuters that an influential adviser to the Crown Prince ran the slaughter via Skype, though many believe he may just be taking the fall for his boss.The Turks supposedly have audio recordings and other evidence of Khashoggi's gruesome end at the hands of his compatriots, but have yet to disclose them.]]></description>

      <title>Two U.S. Navy vessels sail through Taiwan Strait</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIWAN STRAIT  The Pentagon sent two U.S. ships through the Taiwan Strait, a move that might amp up already tense U.S.-China relations.CNN reports that on Monday, the USS Curtis Wilbur, a guided missile destroyer, and the USS Antietam, a guided missile cruiser, conducted a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait, to demonstrate 'U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific', according to the deputy spokesman of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.The two U.S. Navy warships reportedly sailed from south to north through the 110-mile waterway that separates Taiwan from China.U.S. Defense officials told CNN that multiple Chinese warships followed the vessels during the transit, but kept at a safe distance.America's show of force comes amidst an ongoing trade war with Beijing, as well as tensions between the two countries over China's militarization of the South China Sea.Late last month, a U.S. guided missile destroyer passing near the Spratlys had to maneuver to avoid colliding with a Chinese ship that came within 45 yards of its bow.China is unhappy with American support of Taiwan, in particular a $330 million arms sale package to the island nation.While the U.S. officially adheres to Beijing's 'One China Policy', the Trump administration has sought to forge closer ties with Taiwan.]]></description>

      <title>Tourists graffiti 800-year-old wall in Thailand, face 10 years in prison</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHIANG MAI, THAILAND  A pair of genius tourists could be looking at up to 10 years behind bars in Thailand for spray painting an 800-year-old wall. Lee Furlong from Britain and Brittney Schneider from Canada, both 23, were busted at a hostel in Chiang Mai last Thursday, authorities said, according to Reuters.CCTV footage shows the dynamic duo spray-painting the wall near the main entrance to the city's old town around 4 a.m. on Thursday.  Thailand authorities said the partners in crime appeared to be intoxicated. Wow, that's a surprise. Furlong tagged the wall "Scouser Lee" in an apparent reference to the English city of Liverpool. Schneider decided to keep it simple with just a "B." According to Thai police, the two are now looking at up to 10 years behind bars, a fine of up to $30,000 or both, if found guilty.]]></description>

      <title>Immunotherapy-chemo combo wins against breast cancer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  Women with a hard-to-treat form of breast cancer were found to live longer when treated with a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy drugs.CNN reports that triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive form of the disease in which cancer cells lack receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2  making it unresponsive to certain treatments.Cancer cells can be treated with chemotherapy, but often develop resistance to it, allowing them to spread to other body parts. Patients usually survive 18 months or less.A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that treatment combining chemotherapy with the immunotherapy drug Tecentriq was more effective, improving overall survival rates by almost four months.In the clinical trial, 902 women treated at 246 medical centers in 41 countries were randomly assigned either Tecentriq and chemo, or a placebo and chemo.Chemotherapy was given once a week while the immunotherapy drug was administered intravenously every two weeks.The drug deactivates a protein in the cancer cells which keeps it safe from the immune system, while chemotherapy roughens up its surface, enabling the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer.The new treatment is currently being reviewed, and may well become the first FDA-approved immunotherapy drug to treat breast cancer, reports the New York Times.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SAN PEDRO SULA, HONDURAS  A massive caravan of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America are marching north to the United States.The New York Times reports that the migrant caravan started in San Pedro Sula, Honduras on October 12, with less than 200 people. Upon reaching Esquipulas, Guatemala, police blocked them for two hours but eventually allowed them to continue on.The group's numbers swelled to over 7,000 as the journey from Honduras continued through Guatemala and to the Mexican border.Mexico initially ordered migrants to submit to processing at a legal border crossing, but many have crossed illegally, storming through the border gate on October 19 and clashing with Mexican federal police.The caravan is currently walking through Mexico, with over 1,000 miles to go before they can reach the United States border.President Trump has been very vocal about his condemnations of the caravan, and has threatening to have the military close the border on them.He has also threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador for not stopping their people from leaving their countries.]]></description>

      <title>The reason why trains don't have seatbelts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIWAN  Seat belts on trains can cause more harm than good because the train's massive momentum makes it harder to decelerate, increasing the risk of impact injuries, according to experts.Lap seat belts may cause spinal injuries as passengers' necks thrust forward during a crash, according to The New York Times.Trains could use lap and shoulder seat belts, which offer more protection. However these seat belts could also injure passengers who get thrown from their seats upon impact.Installing seat belts on all trains would also be very expensive for train authorities. A Puyuma express train crashed in Taiwan on October 21, with 18 people being killed and 190 people injured, to the Central New Agency reported.]]></description>

      <title>Not exercising is even worse for your health than smoking</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CLEVELAND    Research has found that skipping leg day is quite possibly the fastest route to an early grave.According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, not exercising is more harmful to human health than smoking, diabetes, or heart disease.Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic studied 122,007 patients from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2014, making them undergo treadmill testing and later recording mortality rates.Their findings indicate that cardiorespiratory fitness is linked to a longer lifespan, and that there is no limit to the benefits of exercise. There have been concerns that those who are overactive or exercise excessively are at a higher risk of death, but the research reveals that this is not the case.When compared to top exercise performers, the risk associated with death for those who were sedentary is 500 percent higher.The study concludes that a sedentary lifestyle is equivalent to having a major disease. The good news is it's reversible, you just need to work that body.]]></description>

      <title>Microplastics found in 90% of table salt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[INCHEON, SOUTH KOREA  Researchers from South Korea and Greenpeace East Asia have found that 90 percent of table salt sold around the world are contaminated with microplastics.After analyzing salt from 21 countries in Europe, Asia, North and South America, and Africa, a new study found microplastics in 36 out of 39 brands, reports National Geographic.Microplastic density was highest among Asian brands, especially those from Indonesia. The only three salts free from plastic were those from Taiwan, China, and France.Researchers sampled three types of salts and found that sea salt had the highest microplastic levels, followed by lake salt, and then rock salt.With particles often less than 5 millimeters in size and many the same color as salt, and they are barely noticeable.The study estimates that the average adult consumes 2,000 microplastics a year through salt.Scientists have yet to determine how harmful microplastics are to our bodies, but so far, experiments on mice haven't exactly brought good news.]]></description>

      <title>Canadian rapper dies while trying plane wing stunt for music video</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA  A Canadian rapper was attempting to perform a stunt on the wing of an airplane when things went real south. According to CTV News, Jon James McMurray had apparently been training intensively for months to walk on the wing of a small Cessna while rapping. While filming on Saturday, James made his way out onto the wing which caused the Cessna to suddenly plunge into a downward spiral that the pilot couldn't correct. James was wearing a parachute, but held onto the plane for too long. When he finally let go of the aircraft, it was too late to deploy his parachute. The 34-year-old landed in a hay field and instantly went to meet his maker. The plane was eventually able to land safely.   The ex-professional skier was a fan of extreme sports like skydiving, base-jumping and BMX.]]></description>

The ship had to pay a fine of US$1.5 million, CNN reported.The cruise says the spill was unintentional and claim they only dumped 7,000 liters instead of the 27,000 liters.However an Australian Senator cited an Australian Maritime Safety Authority report that says otherwise.Discharging waste into the Barrier Reef is a serious offense as the coral reefs in the region are already being damaged due to climate change and environmental damage.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ANTARCTICA  A ridiculously rectangular iceberg was spotted last October 16, and there's only one question on everyone's minds: is it real?NASA's Operation IceBridge photographed a tabular iceberg during a flyover over Antarctica. It's believed to have fractured from the Larsen C ice shelf in May, reports the Washington Post.Unlike an angular iceberg which usually has just the tip sticking out, tabular icebergs have a flat surface and steep, vertical sides.NASA and University of Maryland scientist Kelly Brunt explained to LiveScience that tabular icebergs form when an ice shelf grows out like a fingernail and calves off, often resulting in straight, geometric linesThe iceberg's sharp corners are an indication that its new, since wind and waves usually round it out.The iceberg hasn't been measured, but is likely to be more than a mile across. It's definitely not the biggest one ever recorded, however, that distinction belongs to Iceberg B-15, which was 183 miles long and 23 miles wide.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  The New York Police Department has recalled nearly 3,000 body cameras after one of them "exploded," according to a statement from the department. According to NBC News, a Staten Island NYPD officer was wearing the Vievu LE-5 body camera on Saturday night when he noticed the device started smoking.The cop then took off the body cam, which then blew up. Luckily, no one was hurt. Unfortunately, there was no video of the incident. According to the NYPD statement, "the incident revealed a potential for the battery inside the camera to ignite. The cause and scope of the defect are currently being investigated."According to the NYPD, 2,990 of the 15,500 body cams in use by New York's Finest were LE-5 models. All officers wearing the Vievu LE-5 models were told to immediately remove them and return them back to their commands, according to police.For now, those 2,990 officers will be without body cams. Hopefully they'll be able to stay out of trouble.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  Cops in the UK are on the hunt for a thief that's the spitting image of David Schwimmer, aka Ross from "Friends."The BBC reports that Blackpool Police were trying to identify a man suspected of stealing at a restaurant and put out a CCTV still of him clutching a crate of beer on Facebook to ask for help.Amused netizens immediately pointed out the man's uncanny resemblance to Ross Geller, and soon turned the post into a 'Friends' fanfest.As the Ross quotes and theories piled in, even the Scottish guys in blue chimed in with a warning to stay away from the dude, who's believed to have mastered the art of Unagi, the state of total awareness.Blackpool Police also responded by saying they confirmed David Schwimmer was in America on the day of the theft.Still, the actor himself took to social media on Wednesday to prove his innocence, hilariously posting a video alibi showing him with a crate of beer in New York.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ROME  Twenty-four people were injured after an escalator in a Rome metro station suddenly malfunctioned, reports The BBC.Video recordings from bystanders show the escalator suddenly speeding downward while the people on it crashed into the bottom.Passengers on the parallel escalator are shown trying to pull them to safety while others are seen jumping onto the central reservation between the two escalators to escape.Many of those injured were fans of the Russian football team CSKA Moscow and were in the city to attend the football match of their favorite team.Witnesses present say the fans were singing and jumping on the escalator before it suddenly collapsed.Three people suffered serious injuries with one fan's foot reportedly being partially severed, while some others were trapped between the metal plates of the escalator.The regional ambulance service was quick to respond with the injured being sent to five different hospitals across the city.Pictures of the aftermath show the escalator in a tangle of twisted and broken metal.Investigations are underway to find out what caused the elevator to collapse so dramatically.]]></description>

      <title>China deploys facial recognition tech on world's longest sea bridge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[#China #HongKong #HZMB #facialrecognition #artificialintellgenceHONG KONG/BEIJING  Facial recognition and fingerprint technology have been deployed on recently opened the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge. Some drivers on the bridge will undergo facial recognition, fingerprint analysis and temperature-taking thermal scans as Beijing tries to quicken border crossings. This will only be used at one immigration lane initially. Intellifusion, the company behind it, says it is 99.5 percent accurate.The bridge is the longest of its kind in the world, measuring 39 kilometers. It includes the bridge itself, an underwater tunnel and two artificial islands. According to the South China Morning Post, the technology will match the driver and car with pre-registered immigration data. Once cleared, the driver can move on.Citing Chinese media, Reuters reports facial recognition technology will also be used to warn yawning drivers for safety. If they are found yawning three times an alarm will go off.The South China Morning Post reports that cross-border bus and truck drivers will soon be subject to the checks as their information is already held by Chinese authorities.]]></description>

      <title>One year anniversary of murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MALTA  It has been just a little over one year since the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.Galizia kept a day job as a the editor of Taste & Flair magazine in Malta, but she was also known as one of the most famous investigative journalists in the country who exposed alleged money laundering by officials, government corruption, and other crimes.She wrote about her investigations and political opinions on her blog, "Running Commentary," which was established in 2008.Her blog often attracted higher viewership than all of Malta's national press combined, according to the Guardian.She was appreciated by her readers for being outspoken. However, there were also many critics of her work, and she acquired enemies in Malta as a result of being vocal about her opinions.Among her work, Galizia's used the Panama Papers to publish sensitive information about Maltese politicians.The Panama Papers were over 11 million documents leaked in 2015 that exposed the identities of prominent entities across the globe who held offshore bank accounts.Before her murder, Galizia reportedly received death threats in the form of phone calls, letters, and notes on a daily basis.The front door to Galizia's home was reportedly set on fire in 1996, and pet dogs she had kept throughout the years were also poisoned and murdered.On October 17, 2017, Galizia was reportedly driving her Peugeot 108 to a meeting with a bank official. Her son heard her drive away before hearing an explosion.He said he immediately ran out and was met by the smell of burning fuel. He saw his mother's car ablaze, then saw pieces of her body scattered on the ground. A witness present at the time of the explosion said the car had been flung over a small wall into a field, and its gasoline tank ignited, reported Reuters.Police say they discovered a sim card active in the area that may have been used to send a text message to trigger the bomb, which was reportedly placed under Galizia's seat.Three men have been charged with Galizia's murder. However, Galizia's family believes the men may have been acting upon orders from others.The accused men were allegedly tipped off before their arrest and threw their phones into the water before the police came to arrest them, according to detectives involved in the case.The Maltese government has offered one million euros reward for anyone who has information on the case. However, Galizia's family has dismissed it as a publicity stunt.Her family believes Galizia was murdered as a way to silence her and to stop her from exposing more sensitive information about high-ranking officials in the country.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. confirms withdrawal from INF Treaty with Russia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOSCOW  The U.S. national security adviser, John Bolton, has confirmed the U.S. will withdraw from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, or INF Treaty, after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. According to NPR, Bolton cited Russian violations as the reason to terminate the 1987 INF Treaty signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. According to CBS News, the U.S. claims Russia's 9M729 missile system violates the INF treaty. The system can operate at lower altitudes and reach targets across Europe and the U.S. west coast if launched from Siberia. The original treaty prohibited the U.S. and Russia from fielding ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, their launchers and associated support structures. According to Bolton, it is necessary for the U.S. to withdraw in order to adapt to a post-Cold War environment with several competing global powers. He cited efforts to develop weapons by China, Iran and other countries not bound by the INF Treaty. Bolton also said the U.S. has not yet taken any formal steps, but that America would exit the treaty "in due course."]]></description>

      <title>Da Vinci may have had eye disorder that helped him paint</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A new study suggests Leonardo da Vinci may have had an eye disorder that helped him paint. According to Science News, visual neuroscientist Christopher Tyler of the City University of London looked at six pieces of art thought to be modeled after da Vinci, and published the results on October 18 in Jama Ophthalmology.  According to the Washington Post, Tyler looked at two sculptures, two oil paintings and two drawings and conducted mathematical analyses to conclude that da Vinci had "an exotropic tendency of approximately -10.3 degrees when relaxed.Five of the works show an eye misalignment consistent with the eye disorder exotropia that can affect three-dimensional vision. This led Tyler to believe that da Vinci may have had intermittent exotropia. Exotropia is a type of strabismus where one eye turns slightly outward and can be treated with special glasses, eye patches or surgery.   If da Vinci was able to control his exotropia, Tyler believes it may have given the painter an artistic advantage by allowing him to switch back and forth from seeing in three dimensions and two dimensions.]]></description>

      <title>China and Russia spies have to listen to Trump's iPhone calls</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA   It appears that President Donald Trump continues to use unsecured iPhones to talk to his pals instead of using a secure White House line, according to the New York Times. Apparently, Trump has a penchant for using three different iPhones. Two of them have been altered by the NSA to be a bit more secure, while the third is a personal phone. As none of the three phones are totally secure, Chinese and Russian spies have allegedly been listening in, according to anonymous current and former officials. It looks as if the Chinese believe that by gathering a list of Trump's personal friends, they'll somehow be able to influence the reality president's stance on things like the on going trade war. Good luck with that. Of course, the Russians didn't want to let the Chinese have all the fun, so they do have been dropping in for a listen. Fortunately for the U.S., most of Trump's conversations are relatively surfacy and his lack of interest in classified briefings probably means no secrets are getting spilled.  Naturally, Trump fired back at the New York Times over Twitter, calling the report fake and saying he preferred using government authorized hard lines.]]></description>

      <title>Why baby bumps seem bigger at night than during the day</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SUVA, FIJI  With a royal baby on the way, everyone's eyes are on Meghan Markle's bump.Eagle-eyed fans noticed, though, that the Duchess of Sussex's pregnant belly seemed much more pronounced during a dinner in Fiji than just days before in Australia, reports MSN.It could be the clothes, but is much more likely to be due to the freaky yet very real phenomenon of pregnancy bumps appearing larger at night.Birth doula Susannah Birch told Trimester Talk that abdominal muscles holding the baby bump become tired as the day goes on, causing them to loosen up. This allows the bump to expand and sit out further, thus appearing bigger.The muscles recuperate during sleep, and become refreshed and better able to maintain the bump's position in the morning.Levels of the hormone relaxin, which causes abdominal muscle stretching during pregnancy, was also found to be highest at night, according to a study published in the Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides.Women's Health reports that pregnant bellies have also been known to 'pop' seemingly overnight, which is caused by the uterus expanding due to the growing fetus, and rising above the pubic bone. For most women, this tends to happen at around 10 to 12 weeks.Bottom line, Markle's changing baby bump is totally normal and is just like any other pregnant lady's- not that that's going to stop anyone from continuing to observe it in minute detail.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. military to send 5,200 troops to beef up border security</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   With the midterm elections fast approaching, Trump has begun militarizing the southern border to block caravan of approaching migrants.Reuters reports that the U.S. Military is deploying 5,200 active duty troops to the Mexican border in response to a massive migrant caravan pushing north from Central America.According to the head of the U.S. northern command, the first wave of the operation has reportedly begun, with 800 soldiers from Fort Knox and Fort Campbell in Kentucky already on their way to Texas.Operation Faithful Patriot will also send medical units, C-130 and C-17 transport aircrafts, and helicopter units equipped with night vision to allow border agents to spot illegal crossers.Twenty-two miles of barbed wire have already been sent to fortify the southern border, with more available to string an additional 150 miles, according to the Washington Post.U.S. Customs and Border Protection is tracking the caravan of 3,500 migrants, and say they are currently moving through southern Mexico. A second group of 3,000 that recently forced their way through the Mexico-Guatemala border is lagging behind.The nearest border entry at McAllen, Texas is still over 900 miles away, so the carvan's arrival isn't imminent. Still, that hasn't stopped Trump from using what he calls their invasion to drive his conservative base to the polls for the midterms.]]></description>

      <title>Tropical Trump elected as Brazil's next president</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRAZIL  Far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil's presidential election on Sunday, promising to clean up corruption, shrink the state and crack down on crime. According to the Guardian, the 63-year-old Bolsonaro secured 55.1 percent of the votes after 99.9 percent were counted, defeating leftist candidate Fernando Haddad, who secured 44.8 percent of votes. According to Reuters, the former army captain, with close ties to the military, has alarmed skeptics with comments seen as denigrating women, gays and racial minorities. Some in Brazil are also concerned Bolsonaro, an admirer of Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship and a proponent of using torture on leftist opponents, will curtail human rights, infringe upon civil liberties and clamp down on freedom of speech. In his acceptance speech, Bolsonaro promised to lead the country according to the Bible and the country's constitution.]]></description>

      <title>The Northwest Passage could be the newest shipping route</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE ARCTIC  As climate change continues to impact the Arctic, countries are planning to use the Northwest Passage as a shortcut shipping route, reports online magazine Grist.Currently, the Suez Canal and Panama Canal are used as major shipping routes in the world.However in the future, ships traveling from Japan to western Europe could be able to travel north through the Bering Strait to Europe. This would slash the travel route from 13,000 miles to about 7000 miles and could potentially cut shipping prices in half.Ships traveling from Yokohama Port could also make the journey through the Northwest Passage to New York City in about 21 days instead of the standard 25 days, traveling 7,480 nautical miles instead of 9,720 nautical miles through the Panama Canal.As the ships travel through the Arctic, some are worried that fossil fuels used by the vessels may harm the already fragile Arctic ecosystem.Scientists estimate that by 2050 there will be no more ice in the Arctic.]]></description>
