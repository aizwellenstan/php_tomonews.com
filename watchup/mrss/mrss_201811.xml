      <title>China lifts ban on use of rhino and tiger parts for medicine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  China has allowed the use of rhino and tiger products in medicine, alarming conservationists who say it will hamper efforts to protect them from extinction.China's State Council recently announced the partial lifting of a 25-year-old ban which will now allow the use of tiger and rhinoceros parts for scientific, medical, or cultural use.According to the New York Times, powdered rhino horns are used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat fevers and food poisoning, while tiger bone wine is believed to increase virility. Both have no proven benefit.The Chinese government claims the trade will be strictly controlled, and products must only be sourced from animals that are bred in captivity, excluding those in zoos.But conservationists say the move will only fuel black market trade in wild animal parts, endangering the estimated 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers still in the wild.The move is a complete turnaround from Beijing's previous efforts in championing climate change initiatives and banning the domestic ivory trade. Experts speculate that the sudden easing of the ban may be a push to encourage Chinese traditional culture and medicine, reports Time.]]></description>

      <title>"Trojan horse" antibiotic could help with fight against superbugs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA  A new antibiotic has shown promising results after bypassing several multidrug resistant bacteria in early clinical trials.The trials were conducted on a total of 448 patients with kidney or urinary tract infections, according to a paper published in The Lancet.The antibiotic, cefiderocol, was able to enter the bacteria as it hid among iron molecules.Bacteria in our bodies usually look for iron molecules as our bodies' natural response to an infection is to create a low-iron environment, to stop the bacteria from multiplying.Once cefiderocol is inside the bacteria, it is able to kill it as other antibiotics.However, larger trials would still be needed to ensure the effectiveness of the "trojan horse" antibiotic.]]></description>

      <title>How Germany's parliament and chancellor are elected</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GERMANY  Every four years, German voters take to the polls to elect members of the Bundestag, which then selects the next chancellor.Germans cast two votes, one for a candidate and one for a political party. This determines how the 598 seats in the Bundestag will be divided among the political parties. The process is called a personalized proportional representation system.The first vote for the candidate, will be on the left side of the ballot while the second vote, for a political party, will be on the right side of the ballot, according to CNBC.The newly-elected parliament then votes for the chancellor. The chancellor would need to receive more than half of the votes to be elected.As there are multiple political parties, the chancellor also needs to receive votes from other smaller parties along with his or her own party or form coalitions in order to receive an absolute majority of votes.]]></description>

      <title>Giant emerald weighing 1.1kg
found in Zambian mine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KAGEM, ZAMBIA  Gemfields, the world's largest producer of green stones, has discovered a giant, green emerald in Zambia.The emerald weighs more than 1.1 kilograms and was discovered in Kagem, the world's largest emerald mine located in Zambia.A statement released by Gemfields said that the emerald has "remarkable clarity and a perfectly balanced golden green hue."Emeralds in the Kagem mine were reportedly formed 450 million years ago due to a rare combination of in situ minerals and magma from the Earth's crust which then developed into emerald crystals.The gem is being called "Inkalamu" which means lion in the local Bemba language in Zambia.The uncut emerald was discovered in an open-pit mine on October 2 by a geologist and a veteran emerald miner.Several pieces are expected to be cut from the 5,655-carat emerald and will be auctioned in Singapore this month.Most of the emeralds in the world are mined from Zambia, Colombia and Brazil. As a result, emeralds are even more precious than diamonds due to their scarcity.]]></description>

      <title>Angela Merkel stepping down as chancellor in 2021</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  Looks as if Germany's Angela Merkel is beginning her slow motion auf wiedersehen after announcing that she will step down as chancellor in 2021. Following a disastrous showing by her center-right Christian Democratic Union party in recent state elections, Merkel dropped the bomb at a news conference in Berlin. The lame duck, who has been chancellor since 2005, also said she she would be stepping aside as party leader, a position she has held since 2000.   Merkel has long insisted that the chancellor should also be the leader of the ruling party, and that it was dangerous to have too many cooks in the kitchen.She's suddenly cool with dividing the roles between two people. Who would have guessed? But how long can one of Europe's most powerful politicians last, now that her coalition government is increasingly unpopular and unstable? After 13 years at the helm, was this finally a case of the migrant that broke the camel's back? Who will carry the torch as the global counterweight to Trump-esque nationalists now?     What's clear is that the vultures are circling. Will she even last until 2021?]]></description>

      <title>Seas are absorbing way more heat than we previously thought</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA  The world's oceans have absorbed considerably more heat than previously estimated, according to a new study. The results, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, found that seas around the globe may be absorbing up to 60 percent more heat since the 1990s than earlier estimates calculated, according to Scientific American. Researchers calculated the oceans have absorbed around 13 zettajoules of heat energy every year between 1991 and 2016, CNN reports.The findings suggest the earth is more sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions than previously thought. Rather than relying on direct ocean measurements, the researchers looked at the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since 1991. As oceans warm up, their ability to absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide decreases, thus more of those gases remain in the air. By measuring the changes in atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, while also controlling for other factors such as human greenhouse gas emissions, the team was able to estimate how much heat the oceans have absorbed over the past few decades. Warmer oceans could potentially lead to sea levels rising faster than forecasted, dying off of coral reefs, increasingly powerful storms, faster rates of melting sea ice and affecting ocean currents, CNN reports.]]></description>

      <title>Adolescents who quit weed see rapid improvements in memory</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MASSACHUSETTS  Adolescents who regularly use cannabis but stop for 30 days have better memory and improved cognition compared to those who continue to use pot, according to a new study. According to NPR, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry on Tuesday found that when young people stop using marijuana their verbal learning and memory improve. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital looked at 88 participants age 16- 25, who were regular users of marijuana. According to the study's lead author, Randi Schuster, director of neuropsychology at Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Addiction Medicine, the researchers recruited a range of participants. Some of the young people smoked once per week, while others smoked almost daily. Participants were randomly assigned into an abstaining group or a non-abstaining group.  Volunteers had their urine tested weekly and were also given a variety of tasks testing their attention and memory. Researchers found that after four weeks, there was no noticeable difference in attention scores between the two groups. However, memory scores for nonusers improved, while users' memory scores remained relatively steady. The study concluded that adolescents learn better when they are not using cannabis, and that some of the deficits from usage appear to be reversible.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. birthright citizenship explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S.  Birthright citizenship is defined as a constitutional right for any child born in the United States to automatically gain U.S. citizenship.The 14th Amendment states that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."The amendment was ratified in 1868 to guarantee citizenship for all. This included former slaves, who at the time didn't have the right to own property, roam freely or even stay in the country.However, it was still never clearly defined whether or not children born of immigrants in the U.S. were automatically U.S. citizens.Then came the case of Wong Kim Ark. Wong was the son of Chinese immigrants and was born in California. After he returned from a trip to China in 1895, the federal government tried to stop him from re-entering the U.S. under the Chinese Exclusion Act. His case ended up in court, and after a years-long battle, the Supreme Court in 1898 ruled that Wong was in fact a U.S. citizen, as he was born in the U.S. Meanwhile, despite all this, Native Americans were still consistently denied rights given to others born in the U.S. until Congress finally granted citizenship to all Native Americans in 1924.President Donald Trump has announced plans to issue an Executive order to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court would still have the power to overturn the Executive order and interpret the Constitution on its own.Other than the U.S., there are 30 other nations in the world that recognize birthright citizenship including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Panama and Mexico.]]></description>

      <title>Will the Democrats be able to impeach Trump or Kavanaugh?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C.  The upcoming midterm elections are poised to determine whether or not the Democrats can take back the House and the Senate.Members of the Democratic Party have said they will push for impeachment for President Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh should they regain control, NBC reports. But how exactly will this be possible?The impeachment process begins with the House Judiciary Committee reviewing charges against an official and determining if there are grounds for impeachment.The full House of Representatives votes on one or more articles of impeachment, and if at least one gets a simple majority vote, the official is indicted and considered impeached.From there, the proceedings move to the Senate for a trial presided over by the Supreme Court Chief Justice, with the Senate acting as jury.In order to get a conviction, a supermajority, or two-thirds of the senators must find the official guilty. Once convicted, he is immediately removed from office.The Democrats will need to win 218 seats during the midterm elections to regain control over the House of Representatives and initiate impeachment proceedings. Polls indicate that they have a good chance of doing so, according to CNN and polling data aggregator Real Clear Politics.However, the Democrats are much less likely to win enough seats in the Senate to ensure a two-thirds majority vote for conviction.]]></description>

      <title>British Airways flight from hell finally lands after 3 days</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  British Airways turned what should have been an eight-hour flight home into a hellish three-day ordeal for over two hundred passengers.The BBC reports that flight 2036 was supposed to leave Orlando past 7 p.m. on Thursday, but passengers were forced to disembark due to a technical issue four hours after waiting in the plane.They were put in a hotel for the night, but the nightmare continued with more delays, plus lack of communication from BA, whose preferred method of updating passengers was via letter.The flight flew out of Florida over a day later, but was forced to divert to New York after the plane started dumping fuel and lowering the landing gear in mid-air.At JFK, it was hours before a BA rep showed, only to tell the disgruntled travelers they had no food or drinks, and not enough accommodations due to the New York Marathon.Stranded passengers were forced to sleep on the cold hard airport floor for over five hours, among them a young cancer survivor and a toddler celebrating her birthday.Eventually, they were all herded back onto a plane and finally made it back to London Sunday morning.Passengers are still furious at having to endure the flight from hell, especially since they say British Airways has yet to apologize sincerely, according to the New York Post.The airline put out a statement saying sorry, but it also claims its ground team cared for the travelers while they were trapped in New York.]]></description>

      <title>Can cell phone radiation cause 
cancer in humans?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO   Researchers found evidence of links between tumors in male rats and exposure to radio frequency radiation.According to a final report released on Thursday by the U.S. National Toxicology Program, about 3,000 rats and mice were exposed to whole body radio frequency radiation nine hours a day for up to two years. Rats began exposure to the radiation in the womb while mice started at 5-6 weeks old. The radiation used in the experiment was similar to those emitted by 2G and 3G mobile phones. These results do not apply to Wi-Fi signals or phones that use 4G or 5G technologies, these use different methods of signal modulation that the NTP did not study in their research.The rodents lived in specially designed chambers with isolated rooms where a transmitting antenna subjected the rats to RFR fields with frequencies of 900 and 1900 megahertz. The study found evidence that radiation exposure was associated with the emergence of tumors in the hearts, brains, and adrenal glands of male rats. However, cancers found in female rats and male and female mice weren't conclusively linked to radio frequency radiation exposure.The research cost $30 million and was ongoing for a decade. The NTP's goal was to gather information on the effects of mobile phone radiation on rats in response to the increasing universality of cellphone use among humans.However, NTP scientists and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated that the results of the research do not directly affect humans since the rodents were exposed to extreme levels of cellphone radiation, which surpass the current safety limits on mobile phone radiation.]]></description>

      <title>Migrant caravan begins 'route of death' through Mexico</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MEXICO  Thousands of Central American migrants have resumed their march toward the United States on Sunday after disagreements a day before over the route north.  According to the Associated Press, most of the approximately 4,000 migrants are now moving along what some are referring to as the "route of death" to the town of Cordoba around 124 miles away. The next portion of the journey will be one of the longest yet, as the migrants will now have to pass via the sugar fields and fruit groves of Veracruz, a state where hundreds of migrants have gone missing in recent years due to kidnappers looking for ransom payments. A large majority of the migrants are trying to escape rampant poverty, gang violence and political unrest in the countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Mexico now has three caravans totalling more than 6,000 migrants spread out over 300 miles of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz. President Trump has ordered more than 7,000 active duty troops to be deployed throughout Texas, Arizona and California along the Mexican border in response to the caravan. According the Associated Press, President Donald Trump could sign an order next week allowing for mass detention of migrants caught entering the U.S. and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[LAS CRUCES, NEW MEXICO  A hunter in New Mexico nearly crossed over to the great beyond after his doggie best friend pulled the trigger on him.The Las Cruces Sun News reports that Sonny Gilligan had gone to hunt jackrabbits in the desert west of LAs Cruces on Thursday, and had taken his dogs Charlie, Scooter, and Cowboy with him.While in the backseat, his 120-pound lab-rottweiler mix Charlie got his foot on Gilligan's shotgun. When the dog slipped and fell off the seat, his paw caught the trigger, causing the firearm to shoot.The bullet tore through the driver's seat straight through Gilligan's back, breaking a couple of his ribs and shattering his collarbone. Amazingly, the 74-year-old managed to call for help.The lucky man had to undergo a bunch of surgeries, but is now on the way to recovery. Still, all he could think about was his boys.Poor Charlie and his brothers were sent to doggie jail, aka animal services, after the shooting, but have since been busted out by Gilligan's human son.Gilligan says he's forgiven Charlie for very nearly sending him to the afterlife, adding that it really was just a bizarre freak accident.]]></description>

      <title>Rare mandarin duck mysteriously pops up in NYC</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  There's a hot new celebrity in the ponds at Central Park, and obsessed New Yorkers are all lining up to see him.The BBC reports that back in October, Manhattan Bird Alert directed the city's collective attention to a lone mandarin duck that seemed to have suddenly showed up among the city's usual waterfowl - catching eyes with its multi-colored mohawk, pink bill, and orange sail feathers. The rare bird is native to East Asia, so the fact that it's in the middle of the Big Apple is a bit of a mystery.Eagle-eyed watchers who spotted a tag on its leg thought it may have escaped from somewhere, but the Central Park Zoo claims it's not theirs, reports CNN.It's possible the bird came from a private owner. Then again, it's illegal to have a pet duck in New York, so not like anyone's gonna come forward.The brightly colored rock star has been attracting huge crowds of locals and tourists alike, and has since become a social media phenomenon.Not only does the Mandarin have its own hashtag and Twitter account, it's also inspired numerous artistic tributes.Like New York Magazine said, it's definitely the city's most eligible bachelor.]]></description>

      <title>Google workers stage global protest over women's treatment</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GOOGLELAND  Thousands of Google workers around the world staged walkouts last week to protest claims of sexual harassment and gender inequality. Googlers in Tokyo, Zurich, Berlin, Singapore and New York took part in the protests. According to the BBC, workers want to see changes in how sexual misconduct allegations are handled in house, especially an end to forced arbitration, which would finally allow victims to sue.The walkout was held after news came out that Google actually gave former executive Andy Rubin a $90 million payout and kept details of sexual misconduct allegations that led to his resignation on the down low.Rubin, credited as the creator of the Android mobile operating system, denies the allegations. The New York Times, which dropped the Rubin story, also reported on several other sexual misconduct allegations by other Google executives. According to some workers involved in the walkout, bosses had told them not to speak with the media, while others were told to refer reporters to Google's PR department. In response, Google CEO Sundar Pichai went into damage control in an email to all staff saying, "I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel. I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society… and, yes, here at Google, too."]]></description>

      <title>Trump's border wall could threaten wildlife and plants</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA  If the Trump administration's proposed border wall goes ahead with construction, plants and wildlife could be threatened in Texas. According to NPR, the federal spending bill approved in September includes $1.6 billion in 2019 for wall construction, which could begin as early as February.  In October, the Department of Homeland Security issued a waiver to 28 laws protecting public lands, wildlife and the environment in order so that construction could go ahead. In July, scientists published a paper highlighting the negative impacts of the border wall on wildlife by eliminating, degrading or fragmenting habitats. A wall would block access to water and food, and inhibit seasonal migrations. According to Phys.org, in a letter published in March in the journal Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment, other researchers also expressed worry the wall could damage the increasingly rare Tamaulipan thornscrub ecosystem. Other species that would be affected are the endangered wildflower Zapata bladderpod and the threatened whiskerbush cactus.  According to the researchers, negative impacts could be reduced by limiting physical barriers and accompanying roads, while considering building structures that allow animals to pass through and barrier alternatives like electronic sensors.]]></description>

      <title>Excessive screen time linked to anxiety, depression in kids</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN DIEGO  A new study has linked excessive gaming, watching TV, or on smartphones to anxiety and depression in kids as young as two.Research published in Preventive Medicine Reports found that children and teens may have less curiosity, self-control, emotional stability, and a greater inability to finish tasks after just an hour of screen time a day.Researchers analyzed a random sample of over 40,000 surveys from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, which looked at kids aged 2 to 17.Adolescents aged 14 to 17 face the highest risk. Those who spent more than seven hours a day on screens were twice as likely to be diagnosed with anxiety and depression than those who spent only an hour.But younger kids and toddlers whose brains are still developing were also affected. Preschoolers with high screen use were twice as likely to lose their temper. Forty-six percent of youngsters were also more likely to not be able to calm down once excited.The findings validate the daily screen time limits set by the American Academy of Pediatrics  one hour for ages 2 to 5, and two for school-aged kids and adolescents.]]></description>

      <title>Immigrants' diverse gut bacteria changes once they move to U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S.  Geographical location impacts the diversity of microbes present in a person's body, with some places corresponding to much more microbe diversity than others, according to a study published in the journal Cell.The study found that immigrants tend to eat a more Westernized diet, rich in sugar, fats and protein after arriving in the U.S., resulting in a 15 percent loss of microbiome diversity.The dominant species of the gut bacteria changed from a bacteria called "Prevotella" to a bacteria called "Bacteroides," which is commonly found in Western microbes. The "Prevotella" bacteria helps in digesting fibrous foods commonly found in Asia.As microbiome diversity in the body decreases, the risk of obesity and diabetes increases.The study was conducted with the Hmong and Karen community from Southeast Asia and found that first and second generation U.S. immigrants had an additional drop of 5-10 percent of gut bacteria, and ended up with similar gut bacteria to those whose families have a longer history in the U.S.]]></description>

      <title>California teacher caught on video punching teenage student</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  A California teacher has been arrested after he was caught on camera getting into a fistfight with a 14-year-old student.The Los Angeles Times reports that the fight went down in band class, and began when Maywood Academy music teacher Marston Riley asked the teen to leave the classroom for not wearing the proper uniform.Cellphone video taken at the scene shows the boy refusing, instead coming at Riley with a mouthful of profanity and racial slurs and hitting him with a basketball. In response, the 64-year-old teacher calmly takes out his phone to call for backup, but when the vitriol continues, he walks to the teen and swiftly decks him in the face.Footage shows the two going at it as other students scramble to move away. Riley is seen delivering more blows before campus staff intervene and pull the boy away.He was apprehended by police afterwards on suspicion of child abuse and is out on $50,000 bail. The teen, meanwhile, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, but has since been released.CBSLA reports that parents in the community are furious that a teacher would physically harm a kid, but Maywood faculty members and students are backing the teacher up.A GoFundMe page has even been set up to help Riley with any fines or fees, and has thus far raked in over $56,000.]]></description>

      <title>Could the Democrats win the U.S. House of Representatives?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA   There 435 voting members of the U.S. House of Representatives representing the 50 states. All 435 seats are up for election every two years.Republicans currently hold 237 of these seats. Democrats hold 193. There are seven vacant seats.As of midnight on Election Day, Democrats were expected to win 203 seats, while Republicans were expected to win 194. Thirty-eight races were considered to be toss-ups, according to politics site and polling data aggregator Real Clear Politics. For the Democrats, 173 of the seats were considered to be safe, 15 seats were likely go to the Democrats, and 15 were leaning toward the Democrats.For the Republicans, 149 seats were considered safe, 20 were considered likely to be won by the GOP, and 25 were learning toward the Republicans.Among the 38 races that were too close to call, Democrats currently hold five of these seats, while the Republicans hold 33. This means the Democrats have to defend far fewer seats than the Republicans.A total of 218 seats are needed to gain a majority in the House of Representatives. According to statistical analysis site FiveThirtyEight, as of Nov. 1 the Democrats had an 85 percent chance of taking back the House.States are divided into a certain number of districts based on their population size, in order to send a proportionate number of representatives to the House. Every state is guaranteed at least one seat, no matter how small its population.In some states, the party in power will draw up district lines to give it an advantage in as many Congressional races as possible. This process is called gerrymandering.According to the Washington Post, studies show this happens more often in states controlled by Republicans, though Democrats also engage in the practice.]]></description>

      <title>Doctor removes kidney from woman who needed back surgery</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WELLINGTON, FLORIDA   A West Palm Beach woman who went to the hospital for some back surgery ended up leaving minus one perfectly good kidney. According to WPTV, Maureen Pacheco checked into Wellington Regional Medical Center in April 2016 to have back surgery to alleviate pain she was experiencing from a car accident. Dr. Ramon Vazquez was tasked with cutting Pacheco open, so that surgeons could go in and perform the surgery. Unfortunately, Dr. Vazquez thought one of Maureen's healthy kidneys was a cancerous tumor, so he removed it without her consent.Pacheco recently settled a lawsuit against her doctors, including Dr. Vasquez, however a complaint filed by the Florida Department of Health against Vasquez is still ongoing. According to Pacheco's lawyer, Vasquez probably won't lose his license and would most likely just have to pay a fine and be required to do some more medical education.]]></description>

While North Korea is literally littered with official portraits of his father and grandfather  Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Song  the young Kim was initially seen as just a successor rather than a leader. But thanks to delightful 2018 that saw the young dictator meet with the world's biggest orange and North Korea's brethren down south, Kim has now officially reached Yeezy-status.  According to the BBC, the portrait, which features a smiling Kim in a suit and tie, was on display during a recent visit by Cuba's president.According to NK News, the portraits are usually made by Pyongyang's Mansudae Arts Studio and are subject to strict regulations.

      <title>Scientists to test if antimatter falls upwards</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SWITZERLAND  Scientists at CERN plan to drop antimatter into a vacuum chamber to see if gravity affects antimatter the same way it affects matter.Antimatter is identical to matter in every way, except that it has a negative charge, according to New Atlas.If matter and antimatter touch and interact with one another, they cancel each other out and annihilate each other.In the first experiment, the scientists plan to conduct is called the ALPHA-g experiment in which the researchers will trap antihydrogen atoms in a vertical vacuum chamber and test to see what effect gravity has on the atoms.In the second experiment called GBAR, antihydrogen atoms generated from antiprotons will be subjected to a fall of 20 centimeters to see what effect gravity has on them.Scientists predict that antimatter should fall down like regular matter, but there is a one in a million chance that it could fall up instead.]]></description>

      <title>Taiwan would consider hosting US warships on Taiping Island</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI, TAIWAN  Taiwan would consider allowing U.S. warships access to the largest of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea for regional security purposes if requested by Washington. In response to a hypothetical question at the legislature on Monday, Taiwan's defense minister, Yen Teh-fa, said Taiwan could allow U.S. vessels to dock at Taiping Island, according to the SCMP. Six different countries including Taiwan and China lay claims to parts of the South China Sea. At the parliament panel meeting, Yen said Taiwan would consider allowing US vessels access to Taiping Island for humanitarian or regional security grounds if it were in the best interests of the country. According to lawmaker John Chiang, the regular presence of US aircraft carrier groups in international waters of the South China Sea were aimed at keeping China's military expansion in check. The U.S. Navy routinely conducts freedom of navigation sorties in international waters near the islets of the South China Sea, which draws heavy protests from China.]]></description>

      <title>Boiling mud pool threatens California infrastructure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CALIFORNIA   A boiling mud pool originating from a geyser is slowly making its way in Southern California. According to Los Angeles Times, the mud pool, dubbed the "Slow One," began moving six months ago, advancing at an unprecedented rate. It began covering a distance of 18 meters over a few months, but now covers the same distance in a single day.The geyser is in close proximity to the San Andreas fault and is a result of seismic movements in the area. According to Live Science, earthquakes created deep fractures underground that allowed gases to move to the earth's surface, creating boiling mud pools heated by carbon dioxide.Despite its closeness to the famous fault, there is no data suggesting that the recent activities could lead to a large earthquake. However, local authorities are fearful for the damage this geologic phenomenon could cause to local infrastructure.Boiling mud has already forced the Union Pacific Railroad to build temporary tracks after the mud seeped through a barrier they had built to prevent it from damaging the railroad. The geyser is also threatening damage to a petroleum pipeline, fiber-optic telecommunications lines and a portion of a major highway.]]></description>

He reached out to grab it, thinking it was a doll, reports BBC News.The baby instinctively started squeaking. This is when Hutt realized the doll was actually a child and it was alive.Hutt's wife Sue was quick to alert authorities who said that there was only one couple with a baby staying in a holiday camp in the area.Sue then wrapped the baby in towels and went to find his parents. The baby's mother was overwhelmed when the baby was found and reportedly screamed.Emergency services arrived and took the baby to the hospital for a routine checkup. The baby was confirmed to be doing okay. Apparently the baby had been holidaying with his parents when he escaped from his parents' tent by undoing the zipper and headed for the ocean.Rebecca Salter, the owner of the holiday camp, called the incident a "freakish miracle" and said they were lucky for the way things turned out.]]></description>

According to the polling website 270 to Win, the winners of 14 seats that have yet to be declared. Five of those are expected to go to the Republican party. But even if the GOP ends up winning all of them, they still wouldn't be able to keep the House as the Dems already have the majority.That's bad news for U.S. President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Previously they had control of the House and the Senate. The latest data from Real Clear Politics says they've held onto the Senate, winning 52 of the upper house's 100 seats.

      <title>With House control will Democrats try to impeach Trump?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Now that the Democrats have taken back the House of Representatives, does this mean a presidential impeachment is in the works?According to CNN's national exit polls, 40 percent of voters want President Trump impeached. Seventy-seven percent of Democrats supported the move, compared to only five percent of Republicans and 33 percent of independents.With Democrats now in control of the House, they can initiate impeachment proceedings with an investigation by the House Judiciary Committee, and then vote to impeach with a simple majority.To get a conviction, they will need a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. But with the Republicans remaining in control of the Senate with a 51-seat majority, this outcome is unlikely.While impeachment is a possibility, democratic leaders have indicated it is not the priority. They are, however, expected to launch investigations into the Trump administration.The Democratic House has plans to look into the president's tax returns, which he has refused to disclose, and restart the investigation into possible collusion with Russia.In response, Trump has threatened a 'warlike' response should the Democrats use their newly acquired investigative powers on him, adding that there may be retribution from the Republican Senate, reports Bloomberg.]]></description>

      <title>China ups security spending for Xinjiang re-education camps</title>
      <description><![CDATA[XINJIANG, CHINA  Beijing has massively upped security expenditures in Xinjiang, where it's reported to have detained ethnic Muslim minorities.According to an analysis of Chinese government budget by U.S. think tank the Jamestown Foundation, spending on security-related construction in the western region of Xinjiang rose by 213 percent in 2017.The spending pattern is consistent with the construction and operation of highly secure political re-education camps meant to detain Uighurs.Mass disappearances of Uighur minorities since 2017 likely resulted in imprisonment in these camps, where former detainees say they had to endure intense political and cultural indoctrination.But while prison spending increased by 94 percent, formal prosecutions stagnated, indicating that many are detained without a trial or with minimal due process.China claims the institutions are vocational training centers, but figures show vocational spending in the same year actually decreased by 7 percent.The country's human rights record is set to be reviewed by the UN human rights council, which is expected to focus on its treatment of minorities like Uighurs and Tibetans, reports the Guardian.]]></description>

But hey, it's worth the shot … right?Earth's globe-like shape can be easily observed in the shadow it casts on the moon's equally round surface. The shadow is always curved at any given time of the lunar phases.Earth's round edges can also be seen in the horizon. Objects nearing it seem to "appear" and "disappear," depending on which way they are moving. We can see this effect when we observe ships in the ocean. If we were to see the horizon from above, we would also be able to see Earth's surface curve at the edges. Earth's circular form also determines the time zone differences we experience. Time zones are a result of Earth's rotation on its axis.Its spherical shape allows for this as its sides would be exposed to sunlight at a given time while the other side remains dark. This would not be possible over a flat surface. We can also observe the properties of other planets in our solar system. According to Futurism, planets' spherical shapes allow for an equal distribution of gravity. If Earth were a disc-like body, its gravity would pull us at different degrees depending where we stand. Gravity cannot be distributed evenly on non-spherical surfaces.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese singer Kris Wu accused of using bots on iTunes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  Canadian-Chinese singer Kris Wu has been accused of encouraging his Chinese fans to use bots to boost his new album sales. According to Hot New Hip Hop, Wu's latest album November Rain was bought 14 million times in 24 hours, with seven of its songs making it into the US iTunes Top 10. The little known artist outside of China bumped Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga of top spots on iTunes in the States temporarily. A since deleted tweet from Ariana Grande manager Scooter Braun accused the singer and his team of using bots to game the iTunes sales charts.Bots are algorithms that can generate automated clicks to inflate streaming numbers and sales figures.   Wu has 158,000 followers on Twitter, which is blocked in China and 45 million followers on China's Weibo. According to Variety, an insider told them that following patterns of high-volume purchases on iTunes of "Antares," Wu's album sales were acquired fraudulently and will not count toward the iTunes sales chart reported to Nielsen.]]></description>

      <title>Here's how vote recounting works in Florida</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FLORIDA  With extremely close margins in the races for U.S. senate and agriculture commissioner, and a governor's race that is nearing the threshold, it appears as if Florida could be headed for recounts.According to the Miami Herald, unofficial statewide results have to be reported to the state elections office before a recount can be officially ordered. Counties must turn in their unofficial returns by noon on Saturday, Nov. 10. The secretary of state is required to order a machine recount if the margin in a statewide election is less than 0.5 percent. Losing candidates can refuse a recount. If an automated recount is ordered, the second round of unofficial returns would be due from counties by 3 p.m. on Thursday Nov. 15.    In a machine recount, damaged ballots are copied, all ballots are re-scanned and then the number of total votes cast according to the machines are compared with the number of votes initially tallied by the county.If the machine recount numbers are similar, the vote is counted as accurate. And if the margin in the race is larger than 0.25 percent, the results are counted as official. If the margin after the second round of machine counting falls below 0.25 percent, then Florida can order a manual recount for federal and state elections. A manual recount involves counting each overvote and undervote by hand. An overvote refers to voters marking more choices than permitted on the ballot. An undervote means the voter made no choice or fewer than the number of allowable choices on the ballot.   On Nov. 16, overseas and military ballots are counted. Counties need to give official returns by noon on Nov. 18. Official results from counties are then certified by the state on Nov. 20.]]></description>

      <title>Hormone aids regeneration
of amputated limbs in frogs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS  A new wearable bioreactor could be the first step towards limb regeneration.Researchers led by Tufts University scientists have developed a wearable bioreactor that uses progesterone to induce tissue regeneration. The device was tested on adult aquatic African clawed frogs, a species already capable of partial limb regeneration.The 3-D printed bioreactor is made from silicon and filled with hydrogel. The gel is a mix of silk proteins that aid healing and progesterone, a hormone that prompts tissue repair.According to their study, published in the journal Cell Reports, frogs in the experiment had one of their hind legs amputated approximately at the center of the femur. The wounds of the frogs were either treated with the bioreactor, protected by the device without progesterone or left untreated. All groups had their devices removed after 24 hours. After nine and a half months, the the group that had worn the bioreactors with progesterone grew a paddle-like structure with bones, nerves and blood vessels. Those which did not grew a cartilaginous spike-like structure. The use of progesterone proved to alter the limbs at an functional and anatomical level. Scientists hope this finding takes us a step closer to technology that could aid regeneration of human amputated limbs.]]></description>

      <title>Thousand Oaks shooter died from self-inflicted gunshot</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THOUSAND OAKS, CALIFORNIA  A dozen people are dead after a gunman opened fire inside a packed bar in California on Wednesday night.USA Today reports that over a hundred college students were inside the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks for Country College Night when gunman Ian David Long approached outside and shot the security guard with a .45-caliber Glock 21.The 28-year-old then threw a smoke bomb inside the premises and shot at employees near the front, before firing into the crowd of people on the dance floor.Scared patrons began fleeing. Some used bar stools to break the windows and escape.Others ran out the back, hid under pool tables, in the attic, or in the bathroom.Ventura County deputy Ron Helus was first at the scene with a highway officer. They engaged the suspect in a shootout, but Deputy Telus was shot several times and later died. In all, 12 people were killed in the shooting.According to the Los Angeles Times, Long was dead when officers found him at the scene, and an autopsy later determined he had died from a self-inflicted gunshot.Long had been a former Marine machine gunner, and is said to have carried the attack out with military efficiency, though authorities have yet to determine a motive.A former coach described him as physically combative during his teen years, while  a mental health specialist that assessed him recently thought he could be suffering from PTSD.]]></description>

python in South Florida</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA  A man nabbed a 5-meter-long Burmese python, the largest one found in South Florida to date.Snake hunter, Kyle Penniston is now being hailed a hero in his hometown of Homestead, Florida and for good reason. He managed to catch the largest Burmese python in South Florida to date and he gave it a good battle.Penniston was riding along a levee when he spotted a snake in the water. He stopped to to catch it, as was his duty as a snake hunter for the South Florida Water Management District.  Little did he know he was going to come face to face with a 5-meter-long beast. Penniston tried pulling it out of the water but received gnarly snake bites instead. Unfortunately, not even his pistol could save. The bullet he wanted to use to finish the beast was jammed in the chamber. Finally, the snake tired of wrestling Penniston and that's where he took the chance to drag her out into the dirt road. He then  successfully  loaded his gun and as he nicely put it, euthanized it.Burmese pythons have been labeled an invasive species in the Florida Everglades. According to the South Florida Water Management District, "Eliminating invasive species such as Burmese pythons is critical to preserving the rare Everglades ecosystem." .Talk about man vs wild.]]></description>

      <title>Harvard scientists think this maybe an alien probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.SA.  New theoretical research by Harvard scientists suggests that the solar system's first interstellar object might be an alien probe.Oumuamua was first observed by the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System in Hawaii in October 2017. The name means "a messenger that reaches out from the distant past" in Hawaiian.Research published in the journal Nature last year says it is the first interstellar object to enter our solar system and said it would travel inside it for over a year. Scientists weren't sure if it was an asteroid or a comet, so they referred to it as an interstellar object. Oumuamua is 800 meters in length and 80 meters in width, according to Astronomy.com.Scientists speculated last year that it may consist of materials like metals or rocks.A yet-to-be-published theoretical study accepted in Astrophysical Journal Letters puts forward a number of theories on the object, including ideas that it may be extraterrestrial in origin. They theorize Oumuamua might be using a light sail to travel.This technology uses light to propel objects through space. The researchers write that it could be used to transport cargo between planets or stars. Another theory, the researchers describe as a "more exotic scenario", is that Oumuamua is a fully working space probe sent to Earth by an alien civilization. However this claim has been disputed by other astronomers.Astrophysicist Alan Fitzsimmons told the AFP that this wasn't evidence of alien life.He explained that Oumuamua has already show characteristics similar to that of a comet from another star system.When NASA observed it last year, they said the object was traveling at 64,000 kph. The space agency noted Oumuamua would exit the solar system in January 2019 after passing through Saturn's orbit. Its next destination is the Pegasus constellation.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese principal fired for mining crypto in school where he worked</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  A Chinese school principal has been fired after he was found stealing the school's internet bandwidth and electricity to mine cryptocurrency.Apparently Lei Hua, the school principal, used to mine crypto at home with a mining machine, but after he found out how expensive it was to do this, he decided to move it to the school where he worked.Lei had since acquired eight more mining machines and shifted one of the machines to the dormitories at his school, and added the rest in the electronics lab of the school, according to Live Bitcoin News.School teachers had complained of the noise caused by the machines, but the principal found multiple excuses and blamed the air conditioners or heating devices.As expected, the 24-hour mining operation became a strain on the school's electrical cables and internet speeds also went way down.Teachers also grew suspicious when they noticed a rise in electricity bills to roughly 14,700 yuan, or about US$2,114.The principal was fired while all his profits were confiscated by the Chinese Communist Party, as crypto mining isn't legal in China.]]></description>

      <title>'Power mushroom' converts 
light into clean energy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY  A team from the Stevens Institute of Technology have developed a 'power mushroom' able to create renewable energy. According to their study, published in the paper Nano Journal, the team used button mushrooms due to their optimal levels of humidity and temperature which make them exceptional hosts to bacteria.  They then employed 3D printing technology to create a pattern of graphene nanoribbons on the cap of a living mushroom. They then printed cyanobacteria on top of the pattern using special 'bio-ink'.This bacteria was selected due to its efficiency in converting sunlight to energy. According to researchers who participated in the study it has 'an internal quantum efficiency of nearly 100%.'This type of interaction is being called 'engineered bionic symbiosis'. The mushroom provides the cyanobacteria with shelter and nutrients which allows the bacteria to thrive and in turn create more energy. Exposing mushroom to light triggers cyanobacterial photosynthesis during which the bacteria releases electrons that are in turn captured by the strips of graphene.According to a news release by the American Chemical Society, the team managed to generate 65 nanoamps of electric energy.  I guess we could say mushrooms are both nutritious and...energizing?]]></description>

      <title>Santa Ana winds could feed Woolsey fire in California</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CALIFORNIA  Fire officials are concerned high Santa Ana winds forecasted for the next several days could help spread the 85,500-acre Woolsey fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties.   According to the L.A. Times, the fire, which has killed two people and caused the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from Malibu to Thousand Oaks, was only 15 percent contained as of Sunday night. The forecast is calling for wind gusts of 40 miles per hour or stronger over the next few days. According to officials, the blaze has destroyed more than 177 buildings, with around 57,000 structures still at risk.Firefighters are now concerned that potential wind gusts could suddenly change directions, affecting the fire.  Strong winds could also hamper the effectiveness of aerial water and retardant drops. As of Sunday, several parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties  including Malibu, Agoura Hills, Westlake VIllage, Hidden Hills and parts of West Hills, Monte Nido, Gated Oaks and Topanga  remained under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. Wildfires across the state have burned nearly 200,000 acres and killed at least 31 people, according to fire officials.]]></description>

      <title>Some Flat Earthers now think Earth is actually a big doughnut</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DOUGHNUT EARTH  If you've always been one of those Flat Earthers who didn't quite buy into the pizza-shaped theory of the planet, here's an idea you can sink your sweet tooth into  the earth is actually one big old Dunkin Donut. According to Lad Bible, a Flat Earther with the username Varuag back in 2012 posed this gem to the Flat Earth Society, "I have a theory that the Earth is in fact shaped like a torus (a donut-shape). However, light is curved so we cannot tell."He then compiled a list of answers for 11 frequently asked questions his Krispy Kreme theory was likely to encounter. Here are some of the best ones. Why hasn't the donut hole been been discovered? Light bends and follows the curvature of the torus, making the hole "unseeable." How does light curve? Radio waves are reflected by the atmosphere and apparently on torus-earth, so is light. The farther light travels, the more it curves, by the time it reaches the atmosphere, it can be reflected. As light travels around the corners of the atmosphere, it curves every time so that's why the Earth looks flat. When you're standing in the middle of the donut and look up, why don't you see the other side of the donut? Well dummy  as light passes through the first atmosphere, but by the time it reaches the second atmosphere it has diminished enough to be reflected into space, so you see space. He also goes on to explain how night and day occur, why we have seasons, and a HOLE lot more.]]></description>

      <title>China plans to control the weather</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA   The Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation is planning to send rain-inducing machines across the Tibetan Plateau to increase rainfall in the region.Tens of thousands of machines will be installed on the Tibetan mountains and is expected to increase rainfall by up to 10 billion cubic meters a year over an area of 1.6 million square kilometers, reports the South China Morning Post.The machines will produce fine silver iodide particles which would then be lifted into the air with the winds.These particles will then be circulated into the atmosphere.Each rain machine is expected to create a 4.8-kilometer-long strip of clouds.Lei Fanpei, the president of the corporation, told the South China Post that modifying Tibet's weather "is a critical innovation to solve China's water shortage problem."The mountains of Tibet provide a huge source of water in China as its glaciers and underground reservoirs supply water to the Yangtze, Mekong and the Yellow River. However, this isn't the first time China made plans to modify the weather. The country has manipulated the weather during the 2008 Beijing Olympics in order to prevent it from raining during the event.China had even artificially induced snow a couple of years ago in Beijing, according to a report from China Daily.China plans to monitor the system through weather satellites and supplement silver iodide particles from planes and drones in order to maximize its effect.]]></description>

      <title>Trump hotel in Bali could help suck island dry</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BALI, INDONESIA  A project to develop a Trump hotel in Bali could threaten the island's water supply. On August 14, 2015, then presidential candidate Donald Trump signed an agreement in collaboration with Indonesian investor Hary Tanoesoedibjo's MNC Group to develop the Trump International Hotel and Tower Bali, according the the SCMP. The proposed "six-star" resort and 18-hole golf course are set to be built on a cliff-top site previously home to the Pan Pacific Nirwana Bali, according to the SCMP. Of particular concern is the proposed development's environmental impact on the water supply. According the NPR, Audubon International estimates the average American golf course requires about 312,000 gallons of water a day.According to Deutsche Welle, over half of Bali's groundwater is used by the island's tourism industry. The industry's water demands are putting Bali's rice terraces and subak irrigation system at risk. Deep borewells drilled by hotels and villa-based resorts have led to saltwater leaking into and contaminating groundwater. According to Vice, the tourism industry has caused as many as 260 of Bali's 400-plus rivers to dry up.If the Trump development is completed as planned, it would be the largest resort on the island.]]></description>

      <title>Stan Lee: A Marvel-lous life, an animated tribute</title>
      <description><![CDATA[#RIPStanLee #StanLee #MarvelMarvel's Stan Lee passed away on Monday this week at the age of 95.Born Stanley Morgan Lieber in 1922 in New York, he got his start in publishing when he joined Timely Comics in 1939 as an assistant. Timely would later become Marvel.Lee's first credit was in a 1941 Captain America book. But World War II was booming in Europe and, just like Cap, Lee joined the U.S. Army. He served as a signals officer for three years until 1945.Around the same time, Lee was made interim editor in chief at Timely after senior creatives left. Little did Lee know then, but he'd hold onto that temporary post until he left in 1972. But near the end of the '50s, Lee was low and fed up with comics altogether.Deciding to switch gears, Lee co-created flawed and relatable characters throughout the 1960s. Spider-Man, Iron-Man, Thor, The Hulk, Black Panther, the X-Men, Doctor Strange, the Avengers and more would debut in Marvel comics during this time. The rest is history. Stan "The Man" Lee was back. Lee is said to have been deeply involved in the creation of many of the books during his era as Marvel's editor in chief, but he also found time to inject some wisdom into his art.Lee wasn't afraid to get political. Marvel comics featured his monthly column, aptly titled "Stan's Soapbox."  There he promoted books, but also blasted bigots, racists and wrote on all sorts of social commentary. And that was circa 1960s USA, a very different time from 2018.Lee was intrinsic to the Marvel brand and remained so throughout the '70s and beyond.He's been an executive producer on almost all films involving Marvel characters, plus he's had something like a bazillion cameos in them. That's not even mentioning his many other projects.The world is a sadder place without you Stan, but here's to you and your legacy.  Excelsior!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NORTH KOREA  Satellite images have located 13 of an estimated 20 undeclared missile operating bases in North Korea.Specifically, the Sakkanmol missile base, which is around 85 miles from Seoul, is shown in satellite images to be located amidst mountainous terrain.The Sakkanmol missile base includes barracks, underground facilities to house the transporter-erector-launches (TELs) or mobile-erector-launchers (MELs), and vehicle maintenance and storage, according to a study by a Washington think tank.Satellite images also show the base's checkpoint, headquarters building, maintenance depots and entrances to underground tunnels that could potentially hide the missiles and the trucks that transport them.The missile operating bases are not launch facilities. However, missiles could be launched from there in an event of an emergency.Victor Cha, a prominent North Korean expert, claims the missile bases are actively in use and are not "decaying."This comes amid reports that North Korea was dismantling a key missile site in July.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[VANCE, NORTH CAROLINA  An emu and a donkey fall in love after being abandoned at a farm in North Carolina.The Charlotte Observer reports that the interspecies couple came together on a farm in Kershaw, South Carolina where they and other animals were abandoned after the owner mysteriously vanished.Rescuers from the Carolina Waterfowl Rescue said that the two seemed to have really bonded during their time at the farm, so much so that when they were brought to the shelter, separating them became an issue.Jack and Diane  names picked out by the followers of Carolina Waterfowl Rescue's fan page  did not take well to the split. Jack, the donkey, wailed and cried in despair while Diane, the emu, frantically paced around her enclosure. The separation even became violent when Jack began attacking other donkeys in his enclosure. Rescuers quickly resolved that it was best to keep the loving couple together as they appeared to only be at peace if they shared their living space. Once they were back together, Jack and Diane resumed their romance and, according to a rescuer at the shelter, even "sleep and cuddle together."The two are now Facebook celebrities with hundreds of fans lining up to give them a forever home. Let's hope they don't get separated again!]]></description>

      <title>Congo's Ebola outbreak is the worst in its history</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BENI, CONGO   The latest Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is expected to last until mid-2019.The outbreak in the country's North Kivu Province has already killed more than 200 people, reports CNBC.Ebola commonly affects humans and nonhuman primates, and is caused by an infection with a group of viruses within the genus Ebolavirus, according to the CDC.The disease spread extensively in the town of Beni in North Kivu Province due to the dense local population, but also because of "tradi-modern" health centers, which patients tend to visit even though they aren't regulated.These health centers reportedly didn't have running water for handwashing, and patients would reuse needles to inject medicine.The WHO told reporters it will be "at least another six months" before they can declare the Ebola outbreak over, according to NBC News.This is the tenth Ebola virus epidemic the Democratic Republic of Congo has faced since its first epidemic back in 1976.]]></description>

      <title>Laundry balls that mimic coral could help reduce plastic pollution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MAINE   A laundry ball designed to catch microfibers from clothes could help reduce the plastics pollution entering the ecosystem. At four inches in diameter and made from recycled rubber, the Cora Ball imitates the way a coral reef filters tiny particles from flowing water. When washed with clothing, the laundry ball captures microfibers that come off during the wash. According the company, the ball captures between a quarter to a third of the microfibers per wash. A typical household 13-pound laundry load can shed up to 700,000 microfibers, says marine science researcher Imogen Napper form the University of Plymouth in the U.K., as reported by the BBC.The little plastic fibers are too small for water treatment plants to remove, so many of them make it into the oceans.According to the BBC, researchers say one cubic meter of ocean can contain 100,000 pieces of microplastic, which can then be consumed by marine life, to be eaten by humans.]]></description>

      <title>North Korean "ghost boats"
wash up on Japanese coasts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  "Ghost boats" presumed to be from North Korea have washed up on the coasts of Japan.The Associated Press reports the number of ships has increased dramatically in recent years. One-third of these 'ghost boats' touch ground on the coasts of Japan's northern island of Hokkaido. Some are carrying dead bodies.The North Korean boats might be travelling into farther and more dangerous waters in an attempt to reel in larger catches and increase sources of protein for the country. North Korea is struggling to provide its people with sustainable food sources.The boats most likely cannot withstand rough seas due to their deteriorated states. Japanese coast guards say 95 boats have washed up in Japan so far this year, forcing them to increase security measures. The number is expected to rise and even surpass the 104 boats found last year.]]></description>

      <title>Couple and homeless dude busted for fake GoFundMe scam</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW JERSEY  The touching story of a homeless dude giving his last 20 bucks to help a Jersey woman buy gas was actually all part of a plan to get strangers to donate money to the fake good Samaritan. According to the AP, Burlington County prosecutor Scott Coffina announced criminal charges against the couple who lied to newspapers and TV stations along with the homeless guy who was in cahoots with them the whole time. The over $400,000 donated to homeless man Johnny Bobbitt will be refunded to people who gave him money through a GoFundMe page set up by the couple, Mark D'Amico and Katelyn McClure. According to the prosecutor, "the entire campaign was predicated on a lie. It was fictitious and illegal and there are consequences." What other people refer to as karma. Bobbitt was shackled by U.S. Marshals in Philly on Wednesday night, while D'Amico and McClure turned themselves in on Wednesday night and were released. All three Einsteins were charged with theft by deception. According to authorities, nearly every part of their story was fake. McClure never ran out of gas. Bobbitt never saw McClure in trouble and definitely give her any money. Prosecutors began investigating after Bobbitt said he wasn't getting all the money raised on his behalf. He later sued the couple.]]></description>

      <title>Migrant caravan starts arriving at U.S.-Mexico border</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S.-MEXICO BORDER  Groups of Central American migrants who have made their way across Mexico and are looking for asylum in the United States have begun arriving in the border city of Tijuana. According to NBC 7 News, the first groups of migrants began arriving on Sunday, Nov. 12 in trucks and buses. An estimated 1,660 migrants were in the Tijuana area as of Thursday. According to CNN, Mexico's Baja California state have estimated that as many as 9,000 more migrants could eventually arrive at the border. Many of these migrants will now begin the long asylum process. People who fear for their safety in their home country because of their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership in a group can apply for asylum. To be considered, an individual must apply for asylum within a year of reaching the U.S. An applicant is allowed to stay within the U.S. while their case is pending. Individuals seeking asylum are housed in detention centers until they can be interviewed. In the U.S. while waiting for a court hearing, applicants must wear ankle monitors. According the CNN, migrants seeking asylum will most likely have to wait several weeks, if not longer, because of current bottlenecks at US ports of entry.]]></description>

      <title>Omnidirectional urban wind turbine wins James Dyson Award</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM  An omnidirectional wind turbine meant to hang from skyscraper balconies has won first prize in the 2018 James Dyson Awards. According to New Atlas, the O-Wind Turbine  a crooked, vented spherical device  is designed to generate electricity in the chaotic wind conditions of urban areas. Modern cities and their skyscrapers alter wind patterns, causing three-dimensional vortices where wind is constantly changing directions.  Taking inspiration from NASA's "tumbleweed" technology, a team from Lancaster University designed a turbine with a somewhat spherical shape, covered in vents that have large inlets and small outlets for air to pass through. Because of Bernoulli's principle, differences in pressure cause the turbine to rotate clockwise around a single fixed axis regardless of which direction the wind comes from. The rotational energy from the turbine can then be used to run a generator and produce electricity. According to team member Nicolas Gonzalo, the device could allow, "people living in apartments to generate their own electricity."]]></description>

      <title>Article 13: Why YouTube may go dark in Europe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRUSSELS  YouTube may soon start blocking Europeans from viewing content on the platform due to radical new proposals for European copyright law known as Article 13.        Currently, individuals are responsible for ensuring they are within their rights to publish copyrighted material to the internet. The new law, Article 13 of the EU's Copyright Directive, changes this. It places enhanced responsibility on the website. Online platforms would be expected to have automated checks in place to filter out uploads containing copyrighted content.YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki explained in a Nov. 12 post on the YouTube Creator Blog that songs such as Despacito use various copyrights, and not all rights holders are known. It's because of this uncertainty and the financial risk associated with it, that YouTube may block Europeans users from viewing such content in the future.]]></description>

      <title>How the European Union makes and passes laws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRUSSELS The European Union makes laws that shape 28 nations of Europe.According to European Parliament information, E.U. legislation is ideated by the European Commission. After a law is drafted there, it's sent onto the European Parliament for a reading. If the parliament wants amendments, it will note them, before sending them onto the next step in the process.The council may alter parliament's amendments to the draft, and send it back to them for a second reading. If parliament accepts, the proposal becomes law. They can also ask for further changes and if the Council accepts these, it becomes law.If not, both can choose not to adopt the draft or enter into negotiations known as 'concilation'. During this, an equal amount of parliamentarians and council members attempt to agree on a joint text for the draft. If they can't agree, it isn't adopted.If they do agree, the draft is sent back to both the parliament and council for a third and final reading. At this stage, no more amendments can be made to the draft.  Both have to approve the draft text for it to become law. If either rejects it, the proposal is discarded.]]></description>

What does an "In The Building Pass" get you? Well  not a seat, actually you aren't even allowed into the seating bowl.

      <description><![CDATA[LACOSTE, TEXAS  A Texas woman decided to celebrate her divorce with a big bang  literally  by blasting her wedding dress to smithereens.After a court finally put Kimberly Santleben-Stiteler's presumably disastrous 14-year marriage to rest, she and her family threw a divorce party to mark the occasion, reports the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.She wanted to simply burn her wedding dress, but her dad and brother got the brilliant idea to turn it into an exploding target using 20 pounds of explosive tannerite.So on Saturday night, the 43-year-old went full-on target practice with the dress, shooting it with a rifle from 200 yards away.She hit the bullseye on her first shot, which caused a massive blast and a bang so loud it was heard from 15 miles away.Concerned messages immediately started pouring in from people around the county who heard the explosion. But for Santleben-Stiteler and her family, it was simply liberating. Thank god for closure.]]></description>

      <title>Florida Fred Flintstone jokingly nabbed for speeding in footmobile</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WESLEY CHAPEL, FLORIDA  Halloween may be over, but that didn't stop one Floridian from getting into character.According to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, Bedrock's premiere working class caveman was spotted in Wesley Chapel, Florida on November 4, complete with his prehistoric smart car.The faux Fred Flintstone, whose real name is Don Swartz, took to the streets in his foot mobile, but was apparently going way too fast for the cops' comfort.A Pasco County deputy gave him a speeding ticket, which didn't really blow over well, and caused Twinkletoes to go full caveman on the officer.Mr. Flintstone was later released, but his foot mobile was seized by the Sheriff's Office, and is now part of their fleet.Really though, the whole thing was part of a mock arrest and vehicle seizure, and no Fred Flintstones or foot mobiles were hurt in the making of this PSA.Their message? Speeding may be okay in the Stone Age, but in Modern Day Florida, you better yabba dabba don't.]]></description>

      <title>What will happen if the U.K. goes with Theresa May's Brexit deal?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM  If Theresa May's Brexit deal passes into law, what will it mean for the United Kingdom? The Brexit deal consists of two documents. The first is a 585-page agreement ending Britain's relationship with Europe, while the second is a seven-page outline describing the future relationship, according to the Guardian. The transition period would begin on March 29, 2019 and end on December 31, 2020. During this time the U.K. would have to follow all E.U. rules, but would not have membership in its institutions, according to the BBC. The withdrawal agreement would allow for the transition to be extended only once for a limited period, but would require both the U.K. and E.U. to agree for an extension before July 1, 2020. The Brexit draft also includes the calculations for how much the U.K. would need to pay the E.U. to settle all of its obligations.U.K. citizens in the E.U. and E.U. citizens in the U.K. will keep their residency and social security rights after the withdrawal. If by the end of 2020, no long-term trade deal is agreed upon, and if there is no transition period extension, then a backstop of "a single customs territory between the Union and the United Kingdom" would take effect. In a backstop setting, the U.K. is subject to "level playing field conditions" to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage while in the same customs territory. To exit the backstop it would require bilateral agreement between the U.K. and the E.U.]]></description>

      <title>Inside China's plans for the world's biggest supercollider</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  The Chinese Institute of High Energy Physics is planning to construct a particle accelerator over the next decade. According to information from the project's website, it is expected to be situated near Qinhuangdao City, east of Beijing. Dubbed the Circular Electron Positron Collider, the project is expected to be five times more powerful than the Large Hadron Collider in Europe. It will be located in a 100-kilometer underground tunnel.The project will be a double ring collider with electron and positrons beams in separate pipes. It will circulate these in opposite directions.If successful, researchers also plan to build a Super Proton-Proton Collider and use it to collide electrons with positrons. Scientists behind the project expect the collider could potentially generate more than a million Higgs particles and others such as W and Z bosons.The researchers have released the design of the collider and plan to build a prototype before the actual collider is built. Construction on the collider is expected to begin in 2022.]]></description>

Threaten California residents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CALIFORNIA  Deadly wildfires in California continue to burn causing leaving clouds of dangerous smoke along the way. "According to The New York Times, at least 63 people have been killed by 'Camp Fire'  the deadliest fire to date in the state of California  while 200 others are still missing.CNN reported 'Camp Fire' has already burned through 141,000 acres of land and is only 40 percent contained.Toxic clouds of smoke coming from this and other fires are now threatening the health of residents living in nearby areas.Data from government sponsored air quality index site AirNow indicates California currently has the highest level of unhealthy air in the United States.According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, particles less than 10 micrometer in diameter are the most insidious as they cling to lung tissue and can even be absorbed into the bloodstream.Fine particulate matter from wood fire affect children, the elderly and especially those who already suffer pulmonary and heart diseases. However, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, there is little data regarding long-term health consequences that derive from prolonged exposure to wildfire smoke such as the one California residents are experiencing now.]]></description>

      <title>China's "Artificial Sun"
hotter than the Sun</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA   China's artificial sun is hotter than THE ACTUAL SUN.  Researchers from China's Hefei Institutes of Physical Science reported its fusion reactor has reached 100 million degrees celsius in plasma, over 6 times the heat generated by the sun's core.The heat is generated within a device called Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak, also known as EAST. The donut-shaped machine supports nuclear fusion by using magnetic fields that keep hot plasma from melting the exterior walls of the device.According to Futurism, nuclear fusion is a thermonuclear process that occurs when the nuclei of two light atoms, usually hydrogen, combine and form a heavier atom, in this case helium. This process results in release of energy in the form of heat and light  the same way by which the sun produces its warmth. Researcher's from the EAST project hope to develop technology that will allow humans to extract clean energy from nuclear fusion. Scientists from the ITER project  a multinational experiment aiming to harness nuclear fusion energy  sustain that fusion fuels are almost infinite and do not release harmful gases into the atmosphere.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM  New research has found that sperm counts in male beetles are affected by warmer temperatures.Researchers used red flour beetles as a proxy for humans. They subjected them to five-day "heatwave" conditions of above average temperatures. This damaged male reproductive potential and halved male fertility, according to the study published in Nature Communication.Even if the male beetles were able to procreate in that climate, their offsprings tend to have shorter than average lifespans, according to the researchers. Female beetles were largely unaffected.The researchers also found that successive heatwaves could nearly sterilize males.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[PHILADELPHIA  Spending all your time on "social media" sites like Facebook and IG turns out isn't the greatest thing for your mood.A new study published in December's Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology has found a causal link between the time wasted on social media and depression and loneliness. According to University of Pennsylvania researchers, people who cut back on social media show improvements in their mood and how they feel about life. The U Penn psychologists found that subjects were less depressed and didn't feel as lonely when they limited their social media usage. According to Marketwatch, the study looked at 143 undergrads and tested their mood using seven different scales. Half the students continued using social media sites as normal, while the other half were restricted to 10 minutes per day each for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. The study concluded that people who spent less time on social media saw "clinically significant" falls in depression and in loneliness. So if you want to be happier, spend less time on social media and more time just being social.]]></description>

      <title>Cannibal turns himself in, yelling he's 'tired of eating human meat'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ESTCOURT, SOUTH AFRICA   A cannibal got so sick of consuming people meat, he surrendered gave himself up to the cops.It was just another day at the Estcourt police station in South Africa until a man walked in, yelling for help because he was "tired of eating human body parts," South African online news site News24 reported.The man claimed he was being forced to consume human flesh, and to the cops' horror, promptly pulled out a severed hand and a maggot-infested foot from a pink school bag. He put them on the counter as proof of his horror story.He then led the police to a small house where he was allegedly being held hostage. Behind a curtain of the one-room abode were several containers filled with human parts and "muthi," traditional South African medicine.According to local authorities, three other men were arrested after the alleged cannibal's confession accused of murder and possession of human body parts. Their victim was a 24-year-old woman who was found dismembered under large rocks. These types of killings are called "Muthi Murders" and are often conducted in hopes they will bring fortune to the perpetrator.One of the accused died earlier this year in an apparent suicide while awaiting trial, South Africa's Sunday Times reported.]]></description>

      <title>Saudi crown prince behind Khashoggi murder, says CIA</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ISTANBUL  A CIA report found that the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite Saudi Arabia's claims that he was not involved.According to the Washington Post, there is no metaphorical "smoking gun" linking the prince to the murder, but officials believe that such an operation would not have happened without his awareness or involvement.The CIA analyzed a phone call supposedly made at the command of the Saudi crown prince, in which Ambassador to the U.S. Khalid bin Salman tells Khashoggi to go to the consulate in Istanbul for his documents, assuring him it was safe to do so.Audio from a listening device planted in the consulate indicates that just minutes after Khashoggi entered on October 2, he was attacked and killed, and later dismembered.Maher Mutreb, a security official and one of the Saudi operatives, is then believed to have made a call to one of the crown prince's aides in Riyadh, informing him that the operation was complete.Some members of the Saudi hit squad have also been linked to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, having served on his security team and traveled to the U.S. during official visits.While the location of Khashoggi's body is still unknown, Reuters reports that the Turkish defence minister has said his dismembered corpse may have taken out of the country in luggage.Saudi Arabia has offered several contradictory versions of what occurred, and now say an operation to abduct Khashoggi veered off course when he was restrained and injected with an overdose of a drug, which killed him.The Saudi prosecutor's office has announced charges against 11 unidentified people, five of whom could face the death penalty. But U.S. officials say it's unclear if the Saudi government will in fact follow through with the punishment, and when.]]></description>

      <title>Six trapped after elevator falls 84 floors inside Chicago skyscraper</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  A pregnant woman, several law students and some tourists were among the 6 people who escaped from a stuck elevator in Chicago last week. The lift fell 84 floors.The Chicago Tribune reports that six people stepped into an express elevator on the 95th floor of Chicago's John Hancock Center around midnight on Friday. Two cables holding the elevator broke soon after.The people inside said they felt the elevator moving fast and saw a dust-like material enter the carriage. The elevator fell 84 floors before stopping at the 11th floor.Firefighters had to use a gooseneck camera to determine the elevator's exact location, before then breaking through a brick wall to open the doors and rescue the people trapped inside.The rescue took nearly three hours. A Chicago Fire Department Spokesman told the Chicago Tribune that none of those trapped suffered serious injuries.]]></description>

      <title>OSIRIS-REx set to take Bennu asteroid sample with robotic arm</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA's OSIRIS-REx successfully stretched out its robotic arm for the first time in space, as it readies to take a sample from the asteroid Bennu.According to NASA, the OSIRIS-REx is an asteroid study and sample-return mission which launched from Cape Canaveral on September 8, 2016.The spacecraft is expected to reach the near-Earth asteroid Bennu on December 3, and will then prepare to collect a surface sample in July 2020.It will use the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism or TAGSAM, an 11-foot robotic arm with three articulating joints, a round sampler head, and three bottles of high-pressure nitrogen gas.Once the arm is unfurled and touches the asteroid surface, nitrogen gas is blasted out to stir up regolith, or loose dirt and rocks, which will then be caught by the sampler head.The entire process will take about five seconds. Collected particles will be stored in a canister with nitrogen allowed to escape, leaving between 60 and 200 grams of material.Once sampling is complete, and the material safe inside a heatproof Sample Return Capsule, the OSIRIS-REx will execute small maneuvers to back away from Bennu.The spacecraft will then journey back to Earth and eject the capsule just outside Earth's atmosphere, to land in the Utah desert in September 2023.Bennu is roughly 4.5 billion years old, and as an ancient relic of our solar system's early days, scientists believe it could shed light on how that system was formed.]]></description>

      <title>Venezuela creates smart card to get China-style social control</title>
      <description><![CDATA[VENEZUELA  Venezuela has taken a page from China's book by rolling out its own authoritarian surveillance tech in the form of smart cards.According to a Reuters report, Venezuela's new 'Fatherland' ID was inspired by China's smart cards, which allow the government to track a citizen's social, political and economic behavior.Venezuela initially wanted cards embedded with RFID chips, which can track location and data. Ultimately, they used QR codes developed by Chinese telecom giant ZTE to reduce costs.ZTE also built a database for the fatherland cards. The cards are linked to employment and income, property, medical history and political party membership.The Venezuelan government has previously provided incentives to cardholders to encourage adoption of the card  giving cash prizes for rallying voters, for example, or a Mother's Day bonus.Citizens are now being forced to get the cards in order to receive public benefits such as medicine, pension, subsidized food, and fuel.Describing the program as 'blackmail,' Hector Navarro, one of the founders of the Socialist Party in Venezuela, claims Venezuelans who have cards have more rights than those who don't.Mariela Magallanes, an opposition lawmaker in Venezuela, previously investigated unenrolled citizens being deprived of subsidized food boxes, and says the government knows who is vulnerable to pressure."]]></description>

      <title>Massive ancient termite mounds the size of Britain found in Brazil</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRAZIL  Scientists have uncovered tens of millions of termite mounds dating almost 4,000 years, in a remote part of northeast Brazil.According to a new study published in the journal Current Biology, the mounds were made by a species of termite called syntermes dirus, and spread across 230,000 square kilometers.Each conical mound is about 2.5 meters tall and approximately 9 meters wide.The termite mounds contain 10 cubic kilometers of soil, which is equivalent to roughly 4,000 Great Pyramids.Researchers believe the mounds were built as termites carved out extensive networks of undergrounds tunnels to survive, according to Science Magazine.The underground tunnel allows the termites move swiftly in order to feed on dead leaves of caatinga, a specific type of dry, thorny trees whose leaves only falls once a year.The researchers added, "This is the greatest known example of ecosystem engineering by a single insect species."]]></description>

      <title>Wreck of missing Argentine 
Submarine found</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ARGENTINA   Argentine Naval officials do not have all the answers yet but have begun investigations to pin down what caused the wreck.The ARA San Juan was on its way back from a routine expedition at the southern tip of South America when it reported technical difficulties.It first reported a short circuit caused by water that had leaked through the submarine's snorkel and dripped on the battery. Shortly after, officials lost contact with the submarine.Argentine newspaper, La Nacion, says a special investigation commission put together by the Argentinian Ministry of Defense reported that a second explosion may have occurred triggering issues in the control systems which then led to the vessel sinking and imploding due to high underwater pressure.  According to the BBC, the wreckage was found by Ocean Infinity  a seabed exploration company hired by Argentinian officials   in a ravine roughly 900 meters below surface. It was carrying 44 crew members.Family members of the crew are now demanding the government begin efforts to recover the remains of the vessel.]]></description>

      <title>Earth's interior sucking up more water than previous thought</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WORLD  Seismic activity around the Mariana Trench have revealed the earth around it could be taking in at least 4.3 times more water than previously thought, according to a new study in the journal Nature.The researchers deployed 19 seismographs to the bottom of the ocean around the trench, and seven land-based seismographs on the Mariana Islands. Two tectonic plates meet at the Mariana Trench, which is where the huge Pacific Plate seems to be sliding under the tiny Mariana Plate, thus letting vasts amount of seawater to pour through the cracks into the earth's crust 30 kilometers below the surface.The researchers believe that the seawater could turn into hydrous minerals due to the high temperature and pressure. The hydrous minerals would then be incorporated into the lower plate and sink deeper into the mantle as the tectonic plate sinks.Chen Cai, lead author of the study, told Live Science there is no missing water in the ocean and that the amount of water going into Earth's interior and coming back out should be equal. However, it appears that there is a disparity, with Chen adding that more studies should be conducted to find out more about the water cycles of our planet.]]></description>

      <title>Facebook hired right-wing PR firm to smear billionaire George Soros</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  Facesuck admitted on Wednesday it hired a right-wing PR firm to investigate George Soros after the billionaire publicly criticized the company. Faceblow's outgoing head of communications and policy Elliot Schrage was forced to fall on the grenade for hiring Definers Public Affairs in a memo first reported on by TechCrunch. Schrage said that, "In January 2018, investor and philanthropist George Soros attacked Facebook in a speech at Davos, calling us a menace to society."   Later, when a group called Freedom from Facebook emerged, Faceplant sent the Definers to find some answers. The Definers learned that Soros was apparently funding some of the groups members. Both CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg had said they had no knowledge Definers had been hired until the news was made public by a New York Times report last week.  Looks like the NYT report jogged Sandberg's memory, who then tried to walk back her denial saying that Definers work had "crossed her desk."Sandberg then tried to explain that the reason they hired a right-wing PR firm was not to spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Soros. Apparently, Facebites was just looking for good old fashioned dirt to smear on Soros instread.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SOUTH CHINA SEA  A new Chinese structure in the South China Sea maybe for military purposes, according to a report from an American think tank.Reuters reports that recent satellite imagery reveals a newly built platform on Chinese-claimed Bombay Reef in the Paracel Islands, that's topped by a radome and solar panels.The purpose of the new structure is unclear. It could be a navigational aid for transiting ships, but the same function can be served by buoys or an already existing lighthouse.According to U.S. based think tank The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, it's more likely to be military in nature. This is because the reef is directly adjacent to major shipping lanes that run between the Paracels and Spratly Islands.]]></description>

      <title>CDC suggests all of America should avoid romaine lettuce</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AMERICA  Health officials are warning U.S. consumers not to eat any romaine lettuce as it could be contaminated with a strain of E.Coli.The outbreak has already spread to 11 states across America, along with two provinces in Canada, according to the CDC.Thirty-two people have already become sick from eating contaminated romaine lettuce in the U.S., according to the BBC.The CDC is encouraging the public to throw out all romaine lettuce and to wash and sanitize drawers and shelves where the romaine lettuce was stored.The recent outbreak is believed to be caused by a strain of E. coli identified as O157:H7 which produces a Shiga toxin. Symptoms of infection can include diarrhea or hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure.In order to prevent E.Coli infections, the CDC encourages people to wash their hands thoroughly before and after preparing and eating food, wash fruits and vegetables under running water and to cook meat thoroughly to kill harmful germs.FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNN that he believes the recent E.Coli outbreak could be associated with the end of harvest season in California as most romaine lettuce in the country in harvested from that region.

According to Ladbible, the amazing ride is located at the Shuangliu Wanda Plaza shopping center in Chengdu.The pitiful looking ride consists of four horses strapped to metal frames as they are forced to walk around on a motor-driven platform. Suckers need to shell out 50 RMB, or about 7 bucks, for a four-minute, fun filledminus the funride. A sign posted next to the ride describes it as "different from traditional wooden horses, you can really experience the fun on horseback and let your child indulge. Let you and your child be brave."The unlucky horses reportedly are forced to carry little brats for about four hours a day.   According to the Shangma Equestrian Club, which owns and runs the ride, the carousel is a good way for the horses to get exercise. Noit's not.

      <title>NASA's new Mars probe
just days away from landing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA  Mars will be receiving another visitor from its neighboring planetNasa reports by the time NASA's InSight lander descends to Martian soil it will have travelled 480 million kilometers and spent six months travelling through space.  The probe will land on Elysium Planitia, a plain just 600 kilometers from Curiosity's landing site located near the equator.According to NASA, the InSight lander is packed with two cameras that will aid with navigation and an instrument deployment arm that will place research devices on the planet's surface.It carries three main instruments: A seismometer that measures Mar's seismic waves and detects meteor impacts, a heat probe that will penetrate 5 meters into the surface of the planet to measure its heat flow and interior temperature and two antennas called RISE that will help determine the size and composition of the planet's core. As InSight enters Mars' atmosphere it will emit radio signals subbed 'tones' these signals will be relayed to NASA by two space crafts flying behind the lander called MarCOs. The tones carry key information regarding the entry, descent and landing of the lander.  Engineers at the flight control center will be passing down a lucky jar of peanuts during the landing, a tradition that started in 1964 during the successful landing of Ranger 7  the first space probe to successfully transmit images of the moon back to Earth]]></description>

      <title>India struggling to retrieve U.S. missionary's body from island</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NORTH SENTINEL  Indian authorities have said retrieving the body of the killed American missionary from North Sentinel island could be difficult. According to CNN, police and the fishermen who reported seeing 26-year-old John Allen Chau's body last week, went close to the island on Friday and Saturday in an attempt to find a way to recover the body.   The police and fishermen saw a group of islanders armed with bows, arrows and spears guarding something on the beach, the New York Times reported.According to Dependra Pathak, a top police official in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, "we have mapped the area with the help of these fishermen. We have not spotted the body yet but we roughly know the area where he is believed to be buried." Pathak added the Sentinelese were patrolling the beach around the same spot Chau was killed. Instead of approaching to retrieve the body, police sketched out the crime scene and then sailed away. North Sentinel Island is home to one of the last remaining untouched hunter-and-gatherer societies left in the world. It's about the size of Manhattan with an estimated population of about a few dozen people. India has kept the island off limits in order to prevent Sentinelese from catching modern illnesses and to keep trespassers from being killed.According to Indian law, people are not allowed to travel within five nautical miles of the  island and the Indian Navy patrols is day and night.]]></description>

      <title>Engineers at MIT fly first
plane with no moving parts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  Engineers at MIT have managed to fly an airplane with no moving parts. The aircraft was designed to resemble a glider, it weighs roughly two kilograms and has a 5-meter wingspan. The plane has two rows of wires under its wing. The row at the front end of the wing carries 20,000 volts of positively charged particles called ions. The ions are then attracted to the row on the back end of the wing which carries a negative charge of 20,000 volts. As the ions move to the back row they collide with neutral air pushing it behind the glider and generating electroaerodynamic thrust, driving the aircraft forward. This air is called ionic wind.According to their study, published in the journal Nature, the team tested the glider inside a gym where it managed to sustain flight and travel 60 meters, making it the first solid state flight  or flight without moving parts like turbines and propellers.Engineers participating in the study hope this technology can be the first step towards designing aircrafts that are quieter and do not emit combustion emissions. Engineer Steven Barret says the team was inspired by the futuristic space crafts from Star Trek. Let's hope the technology they've developed lives long and prospers.]]></description>

      <title>Wild turkey wreaks havoc on Rhode Island town</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JOHNSTON, RHODE ISLAND  Everyday is turkey day in this small Rhode Island town, but that's not exactly a good thing.The Guardian reports that when three wild turkeys arrived in Johnston, Rhode Island in May, the locals warmed up to the new residents fairly quickly. They gave them snacks and took photos. Someone even made a Facebook page.It was all in good fun until the birds started coming after people. Animal Control managed to catch two of the turkeys, but the third managed to make a run for it.Six months later, the turkey is still on the lam. It's repeatedly halted traffic with its wily-nily crossing of the highway, and trapped people in their cars with vicious pecking attacks.The bird is both quick-witted and quick on its feet, and keeps outsmarting the humans. It's learned to recognize animal control vehicles, so officers have had to use undercover cars.They even got a net gun, only to have it malfunction as they crept up on the bad bird. And as if things weren't hard enough, the turkey's also started sleeping up telephone poles and trees to avoid capture.The mayor reckons the feathered menace won't leave because it's acquired a taste for Starbucks muffins and Smashburger fries. Then again, maybe it just enjoys turning the tables on humans.]]></description>

      <title>China's Orwellian social credit system to start by 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  The Chinese government has yet another trick up its sleeve to keep citizens on lock down.According to Reuters, China is planning to launch a social credit system that will assign  "personal trustworthiness points" as a means of monitoring citizens and businesses.Trustworthy individuals will reportedly be provided with more access to society while individuals who are blacklisted will be severely restricted.Credit history, contract obligation fulfillment, character traits, behavior, preferences, and interpersonal relationships will all be considered in calculating a credit score.Data gathered by the system could impact an individual's access to public services and employment. It may also affect a citizen's ability to start a business. People with high trustworthy scores could be given easier market access.Participation is currently not mandatory. Once it becomes required, however, people with low scores could be punished with slower internet speeds, denied travel, and access to certain restaurants, night clubs, golf courses.Beijing plans to implement its social credit system by 2020.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese scientist claims to create world's first CRISPR babies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  A scientist in China has been under scrutiny for allegedly using CRISPR, a gene-editing tool, to create the first gene-edited babies.In describing his process of gene-editing, He Jiankui said he first "washed" the sperm to separate it from semen and then placed the sperm into a single egg to create an embryo during in vitro fertilization.After the embryo was 3 to 5 days old, CRISPR-cas9 was used to remove a gene called CCR5.The scientist claims he previously experimented on editing the DNA of mice, monkey and human embryos in his lab for several years.He claims he altered the DNA to make the babies immune to HIV, according to the Associated Press. He also claims the gene surgery was a success and produced twin baby girls.The participants of the study were reportedly told that gene-editing was similar to a vaccine and were made to sign a consent form in which they were told that gene editing on an embryo has never been tried before and carries risks.An immediate investigation has been ordered into He's claims of having created the world's first genetically-edited babies, according to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.The hospital He claims to have conducted the research in has denied any involvement with the surgery and said the babies weren't born there.Shenzhen Hermonicare Women's and Children's Hospital also said they plan to conduct an internal investigation on two doctors in their hospital that the Chinese scientist claims were also involved.]]></description>

      <title>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is straightening itself out</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PISA, ITALY  The Tower of Pisa may be known for its distinctive tilt, but recent years have seen it becoming slightly more upright.The BBC reports that the Tower of Pisa was constructed on a layer of clay and sand that was softer to the south, and began to tilt by the time the third storey was being built.To compensate for this, the next five levels were constructed with one side shorter than the other, resulting in a structure that is not only tilting, but is also curved.By 1990, the marble tower was leaning six degrees, or 13 feet, according to CNN. Officials feared it might topple over and closed it to the public for corrective work.Cables were attached to the third storey to stabilize the tower. Counterweights and braces were added while soil was removed from the north side to allow it to straighten out.Experts say the Tower of Pisa is now stable, and has lost 1.5 inches of its tilt over the past 17 years, from its reopening in 2001 to the present.CBS reports that at its current pace, it may take another thousand years for the tower to straighten out completely. So tourists and Instagrammers shouldn't worry - the famous leaning landmark will still be available for photo-ops for a good long while.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT  Researchers have taken inspiration from a sea creature to create a new kind of water treatment.According to the study published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, coagulation is a chemical water treatment process that causes colloidal and suspended water-borne particles to group into formations and settle. Conventional coagulants like aluminum sulfate remove large particles but cannot capture smaller dissolved contaminants.Researchers from Yale and Peking University sought to address this issue. They modeled a nanocoagulant after the sea anemone Actinia to remove a broad range of contaminants in a single step.]]></description>

      <title>'Space bugs' onboard ISS 
could pose risk to astronauts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE    Researchers from the California Institute of Technology studied bacteria retrieved from the ISS space toilet and exercise platform.According to their study published in the journal BMC Microbiology, all five strains that were analyzed proved to be resistant to several common antibiotics such as penicillin, rifampin, cefazolin, cefoxitin and oxacillin among others. They showed a level of intermediate resistance for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin.Researchers reported that the microbes found on the ISS are a variety of the Enterobacter, a bacterium that causes diseases in newborns and people with weak immune systems.According to experimentation through computer modelling, there is a 79 percent chance that the bacteria could be pathogenic  or likely to cause a disease in humans.Researchers are concerned about the health risks the propagation of such bacterias could pose for astronauts in future missions. The team stated that ''in vivo" experiments would help further understand the true levels of pathogenicity of the bacteria in humans. For now the bacteria are not threatening the lives of astronauts living in the ISS, but researchers will keep a close watch in order to prevent health risks for future expeditions.]]></description>

      <title>China facial recognition nabs jaywalker, too bad it was a bus</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NINGBO, CHINA  A facial recognition system in China proved that it definitely recognizes faces, even ones on the side of a bus. According to Mashable, some cities in China have rolled out facial recognition tech at intersections in a bid to identify jaywalkers and then blast them with a good dose of public shaming. Beijing's goal is to dissuade behavior it deems unacceptable by recognizing the person's face, checking it with a database, then putting their personal information on public screens. According to Abacus, one camera at the Jiangxia Bridge East intersection in Ningbo knocked a home run when it nabbed one famous jaywalker. Unfortunately, it had to be called back after it turned out to be a bus ad. Apparently, the bus was driving through the intersection when the facial recognition scanned the face of a businesswoman on an advert and then plastered her face all over the public screen.  Ningbo's traffic po po later said over their Twitter knockoff Weibo that they made a mistake and that the system had been updated.]]></description>

According to WFLA, late last Wednesday night, the police got a call about a vehicle on the wrong trackliterally, as the car was on the railroad tracks. When the po po showed up on scene the driveraka Google Mapstold them "her GPS advised her to go this way." A Facebook post from the City of Duquesne Police Department said the woman was totally sober and had no medical conditions affecting her decision-making. When one of the commenters blamed the driver's common sense for not kicking in when the GPS told her to turn onto the tracks, the cops were kind enough to respond. "Just to be clear. This vehicle was going straight on the highway and veered off. There was no turn involved here."Unfortunately, Magellan's car had to be towed from the tracks and she was given a ticket for careless driving.]]></description>

They do not have the ability to warm themselves in cold water.Turtles with the condition suffer from various symptoms including, a decreased heart rate, low blood circulation, shock, pneumonia and death.Robert Prescott, director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society's Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, told the paper the sea turtles were "flash-frozen" in swimming positions.

      <title>Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest 'worst in 10 years': Brazil</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRAZIL  Brazil has recorded its worst annual deforestation figures in ten years.7,900 square kilometers of the Amazon rainforest was destroyed between August 2017 and July 2018, according to the BBC.This represents a 13.7 percent increase from last year's figures.Most of the deforestation took place in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Para.In addition to affecting water supplies, deforestation could also cause the rainforest to start releasing greenhouse gases instead of taking in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the National Geographic reports.Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist, said if sixty percent of the forest degrades to a savanna, it could result in five or six years' of fossil-fuel emissions being released into the air.Deforestation was responsible for forty-six percent of Brazil's greenhouse gas emission in 2017, according to the Guardian.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists propose 'dimming sun'
as solution to climate change</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA  Scientists from Harvard and Yale analyzed the possibility of 'dimming the sun' to battle climate change.  If this sounds like it's straight out of a sci-fi movie, it's because it's not real … yet.Fleets of specially designed aircrafts would fly roughly 20 kilometers above ground in the lower stratosphere.Once there the planes would spray tiny sulphate particulates to block sunlight in a process that is known as stratospheric aerosol injection.According to their study, published in the journal Environmental Research letters, this technique could cut the rate of global warming in half.Researchers who participated in the study state it would be a "remarkably inexpensive" process costing around $2 bn to $2.5 bn a year.CNN reported the plan doesn't cover greenhouse gas emissions and could have negative consequences such as extreme shifts in weather and endangering crop yields. It's important to note that the engineers behind this are not suggesting this is the ultimate solution to climate change, but just wanted to estimate technology costs of stratospheric aerosol injection.]]></description>

      <title>Pilot misses landing because he was catching some ZZZs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA  A small plane missed its landing in Australia by about 30 miles or so because the pilot was sleeping in the cockpit. According to the BBC, Maverick was the only person on the freight flight from Devonport to King Island in Tasmania on November 8.Apparently, the Vortex Air Piper PA-31 plane was set to finish a 150 mile trip and touch down at 7:15 local time. With some time to kill, the pilot set the aircraft on autopilot, and according to a Vortex Air statement, "unintentionally fell asleep while in command of the aircraft.""The issue became apparent when air traffic control was unable to contact the pilot in-flight and the aircraft traveled past the intended destination point," the statement said. According to The Australian newspaper, air traffic control made several radio calls to pilot while he was counting sheep. Goose eventually woke up and turned the plane around to land safely on King Island. Looks like the pilot had almost no sleep the night before due to a personal crisis. According to the AP, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority are investigating the incident.]]></description>

      <title>Researchers turn plastic bottles into versatile aerogel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SINGAPORE  Researchers from the National University of Singapore have found a way to convert plastic bottles into an ultralight super material with various applications.Eco-Business reports that the process involves plastic bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate or PET. These are first shredded into fibers and combined with several chemicals, including hydrochloric acid and polyvinyl acetate.The solution is put in a sonicator where it is mixed using sound energy, then freeze-dried to produce an aerogel that is soft, durable, and flexible. One plastic bottle can produce an A4 sheet of aerogel.According to a press release from the National University of Singapore, the aerogel is versatile, and can serve unique functions depending on the surface treatments. When coated with an amine group, it can be used in pollution masks to absorb dust particles and carbon dioxide.It can absorb large amounts of oil when incorporated with various methyl groups, and withstand temperatures of up to 620 degrees Celsius when coated with fire retardant chemicals.Researchers have listed several practical uses for the aerogels, like cleaning oil spills, building insulation, or as a lightweight thermal lining for firefighter coats.The fabrication process is also quicker and more cost-effective than conventional methods, and easily scalable for mass production.

      <title>Man's beer belly was actually 77-pound cancerous tumor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DOWNEY, CALIFORNIA  A man who for years was teased by his friends for his "beer belly" is now walking around minus a 100 pounds after finding out it was actually a cancerous tumor. According to CBS Los Angeles, 47-year-old Hector Hernandez noticed that something was wrong in July of this year. For years his belly had been getting bigger, but this arms and legs kept getting smaller. Hernandez finally went to get a CT scan, which revealed a retroperitoneal liposarcoma, a cancer that begins in the fat cells around the abdomen. According to Dr. William Tseng, a surgical oncologist at USC's Keck School of Medicine, these types of tumors are usually 20 to 30 pounds, but Hernandez's had grown to be a whopping 77-pounds.  Hernandez was tipping the scales at 300 when he went in for surgery. After a six hour procedure, he came out 100 pounds lighter. Doctors are going to keep a close eye on Hernandez, but at least for now he is cancer free.]]></description>
