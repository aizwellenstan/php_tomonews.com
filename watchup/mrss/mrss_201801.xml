      <title>Delta flight forced to turn around because of bird in cockpit</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DETROIT  A Hot-lanta bound Delta flight was forced to hang a u-ey after the crew found a bird flying around the cockpit. Before the flight, the pilot happened to see a sparrow fly into the cockpit, causing the flight to be delayed as crew and maintenance workers searched for the little feathered fellow. After a delay and unsuccessful search attempt, the pilot decided to take off. Wouldn't you know it, shortly after the aircraft took off, the sparrow reappeared again in the cockpit, so the pilot decided to turn the plane back around. After getting back to Detroit Metro Airport, crews were finally able to grab the little guy and get him off the plane. In the end, after a considerable delay, the flight eventually made its way down to Atlanta. No word on what flight the sparrow ended up taking.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese firefighters rescue man from jumping off a roof</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WENZHOU, CHINA  Firefighters in eastern China recently rescued a heartbroken man just in the nick of time to prevent him from making a fatal mistake.According to Chinese media The Paper, on December 27th an unnamed man in Zhejiang province's Yueqing[c] city was seen alone on the rooftop of an apartment. After getting a call about the situation, city police and firefighters arrived at the scene and tried to talk the distraught man down. However, he resisted and decided he'd rather leap off instead. Luckily, the firefighters and police possessed some quick reflexes and grabbed the man's arm before he went too far over the edge.After being pulled back to safety, the man reportedly held onto a firefighter and wept, and later embraced his parents when they rushed to the scene.The man later told the media he was sorry for his foolishness, he had thought about how his parents would react if he had gone through with it. And if he didn't already feel bad enough, local police warned the man that he could be punished for disrupting the peace and for wasting public resources.]]></description>

      <title>Better treatment for Alzheimer's in 10 years, predicts neuroscientist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  Alzheimer's currently has no cure, but breakthroughs in research could lead to better treatment in just 10 years.In an interview with WBUR, British neuroscientist Joseph Jebelli claims memory loss comes with age, but forgetting what certain everyday things are for could signal a more serious problem.Healthy brains shrink by about 10 percent between ages 50 and 80. Brain cells shrivel up slightly, reducing contact between each cell and causing them to function more slowly.In patients with Alzheimer's, toxic proteins cause a buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain, which causes cell death. Current medication only treats the symptoms, and can delay them for six months to a year.Researchers have been looking into ways of using sleep to treat the disease, since the brain uses cerebrospinal fluid to clean away the plaques and tangles during sleep.Scientists are also considering neural stem cells as a treatment for Alzheimer's, believing that the cells can be activated to generate new neurons  allowing the brain to heal itself.Jebelli believes the future of Alzheimer's treatment lies not in an outright cure but in being able to manage and control the disease enough to keep its symptoms at bay.]]></description>

      <title>What the hell is the keto diet?</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA  The diet that has been gaining in popularity reportedly can help those practicing it burn 10 times as much fat as a standard diet. The ketogenic  keto  diet was first introduced in the 1920s to treat epilepsy and diabetes, Business Insider reported. It involves eating only 50 grams of carbohydrates a day, roughly one plain bagel or a cup of white rice. The USDA recommends people eat 225 to 325 grams of carbs a day. On a keto diet, the body switches into starvation mode and burns excess fat stores for fuel.On the diet, healthy fats make up 80 percent of daily caloric intake, while protein intake should be 20 percent. For comparison, the average American gets 50 percent of calories from carbs, 30 percent from fat and 15 percent from protein, according to the CDC.  The human body breaks down carbs into glucose, to be used for energy or stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen. When carbs are taken out of the diet, the body burns up glucose reserves and then breaks down stored fat into fatty acids. These fatty acids move to the liver and are converted into ketones.The brain and other organs use up ketones in a process called ketosis. Some studies have found a low-carb, high-fat diet could may promote weight loss, improve focus, and hold off age-related diseases.]]></description>

      <title>Chocolate could be gone forever by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA  Scientists say chocolate is in danger of disappearing as early as 2050 due to global warming. Researchers from the University of California are now working with the Mars company to save the cacao plant from disappearing, Business Insider reported. Warmer temperatures and drier weather conditions will soon threaten the world's cacao plants. Cacao can only grow within a narrow strip of rainforested land about 20 degrees north and south of the equator, where temperature, rain and humidity are relatively constant year round.   Over half of the world's chocolate currently comes from two west African countries: Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.  Rising temperatures over the next few decades will make those regions unsuitable to grow cacao.Berkeley scientists are now using a technology known as CRISPR to modify of cacao plant DNA in order to see if it can be made to survive in different climates. Researchers hope to be able to develop cacao plants that don't wilt or rot at their current elevations under warmer conditions.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Hundreds of smartphone apps could be tracking their users' television viewing habits.According to The New York Times, various game apps use software named Alphonso, a program which collects television viewing data via smartphone microphone, reported the Times. The paper found the software on various apps designed for children.Alphonso says users can opt out of this and is made clear before users download an app. The company told The Times its disclosures comply with federal trade guidelines.Alphonso Chief Executive Ashish Chordia told the Times around 1,000 games, messaging and social apps use Alphonso software. He didn't tell the paper which apps or how many users Alphonso keeps track off. The Alphonso company website says the software uses automated content recognition to identify what ads and programing a user is watching within "a fraction of a second, in a completely anonymous fashion." The company collects this data for advertisers, reported the Times. Alphonso can also pinpoint what people are watching via audio signals in TV ads. The software can also track what films via people watch at the cinema based on audio snippets provided to the company from film studios, reported the Times, citing Alphonso Chief Executive Ashish Chordia. The company also gathers data from TiVO, televisions, and streaming devices from other manufacturers, reported the Times. This, the Times reports, can be combined with characteristics such as age, sex and income via large data companies.]]></description>

      <title>$2,500 virtual assistant could worsen Japan's population crisis</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  Japan otakus may be like the prospect of intimacy with anime holograms, but the country's population problem may have just gotten worse.Japan has a baby shortage, thanks in part to young Japanese who are shunning romantic relationships in favor of a two-thousand dollar holographic wife, reports Business Insider.Gatebox is technically a virtual assistant like Amazon Alexa, but instead of a disembodied voice, you get Azuma Hikari, a character that's exceedingly cutesy and likes to talk.It helps fill in an intimacy void, with the virtual character providing companionship without all the trappings of a messy, human relationship.It even sends you messages throughout the day like a normal friend, or you know, wife.All in all, Gatebox seems like a reasonably pleasant alternative to those of us who don't interact well with actual people.Except, virtual relationships don't result in babies that help ease a declining birth rate, so while that void of intimacy may be filled, consider the population going, going, and soon, gone.]]></description>

      <title>North Korea accidentally blew up one of its cities with a missile</title>

Instead it crashed in the city of Tokchon, located about two hours from Pyongyang. Everyone in the world at the time knew the test was a failure, they just didn't know how spectacularly. The missile was launched from North Korea's Pukchang Airfield, but things then went immediately south as the it flew 24 miles to the northeast blowing up industrial or agricultural facilities in Tokchon. In the meantime while North Korea is busy annihilating itself, what's Orangina doing? Bragging about the size of his bigly button.]]></description>

      <title>Woman trials first portable bionic hand with sense of touch</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ROME  An Italian woman has become the first woman to try out the first bionic hand with a sense of touch that can be worn outside a laboratory.BBC reports that scientists in Rome have unveiled a portable bionic hand which uses sensors and electrodes to restore a sense of touch, trialing the technology on Almerina Mascarello who lost her hand in an accident 25 years ago.Sensors on the prosthetic hand detect whether an object being held is hard or soft, and send electrical signals to a portable computer.The signals are converted into sensory impulses and sent to electrodes implanted in the upper arm, which then relay it to the brain.The process happens in real time, and Mascarello claimed she felt the sensation spontaneously, as though it were her real hand. Unfortunately, she had to give back the prototype once the six-month trial period ended.Scientists are now working on miniaturizing the electronics and making the technology clinically usable.]]></description>

      <title>China doesn't want the world's recycled plastic garbage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  China's ban on importing recycled plastic garbage is causing trash to pile up recycling facilities around the UK. China imported 7.3 million tons of waste plastic in 2017 from the U.S., the EU, the UK and Japan, Conversation reported.  But starting this year, it is now banning 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste.  Britain alone sends around two thirds  about 500,000 tons  of its recycled plastic garbage to China every year. Recycling companies are now scrambling to find other markets for their recyclables, the Telegraph reported.  Some UK recycling firms are now looking to Malaysia and Vietnam, however, both those countries have capacity issues. Unless other alternative markets can be found, the plastics will have to be sent for incineration or dumped in a landfill.]]></description>

      <title>What is the Ripple currency exchange?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Thanks to the Bitcoin craze, cryptocurrencies are being thrust into the limelight- and now it's Ripple's time to shine.According to CoinMarketCap, Ripple is currently the second most valuable digital currency on the market, second only to Bitcoin. It's both a payment network and a cryptocurrency. It uses blockchain technology, but is differentiated from other platforms by its ties with legitimate financial institutions, reports CNN Money.Ripple's currency is known as XRP and is not mined by users. The company has control, initially creating 100 billion coins, with 38 billion currently in circulation.The rest of the coins will reportedly be released into the market gradually- up to a billion XRP tokens a month.Other cryptocurrencies have a stored value and can be used to buy goods and services. But XRPs mainly cover transaction fees as an anti-spam measure, and are destroyed soon after.Ripple's main purpose is to facilitate global money transfers. Banks take 3 to 5 days to process cross-border payments, but transactions on the Ripple network are cleared in only 4 seconds.The platform also boasts low fees, and can handle up to 1,500 transactions per second, compared to only seven on Bitcoin.By and large, the core function of Ripple is markedly different from other cryptocurrencies available in the market. Whether or not it's a good investment is another thing entirely.]]></description>

      <title>Sydney dubbed the hottest place on Earth after temps soar to 47.3C</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SYDNEY  The U.S. northeast may be experiencing record-breaking low temperatures, but in the land down under, Aussies are melting from the sweltering heat.The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Sydney became the hottest place on Earth on January 7, with temperatures in the western suburb of Penrith reaching 47.3 degrees Celsius.It was a few degrees shy of breaking the record for hottest day in the area  a 47.8 degree temperature recorded in Richmond in 1939. The hot weather combined with strong winds increased bushfire occurrences, prompting certain areas to issue a total fire ban prohibiting open air fires, welding, barbecues, and throwing lit cigarettes, among others.The heat caused higher-than-normal ozone levels, prompting a forecast of poor air quality, which could affect those with respiratory problems.Extreme temperatures also affected train track infrastructure, and contributed to power outages, which affected roughly 3,000 properties throughout Sydney.The next few days are expected to be cooler compared to Sunday's scorcher, but still relatively hot.]]></description>

      <title>Pulse-emitting device helps those suffering from ringing in their ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN  A new device may hold the key to silencing the persistent ringing sufferers of tinnitus often hear.Tinnitus is characterized as a persistent ringing, or similar noise, that can heard in the ears. It affects around 25 million Americans, according to U.S. government information from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. It isn't a disease, but a symptom of something wrong in the auditory system. This can be anything from ear wax in the canal, hearing loss to more serious conditions such as diseases of the heart and blood vessels.The device, designed by University of Michigan researchers, works by emitting timed sounds and low-strength electrical pulses that direct damaged nerve cells back toward normal functionality. According to a University of Michigan news release, researchers tested the device on animals and 20 human patients for four weeks. The human patients were divided into two groups, one with a real device and one that only produced sounds. After four weeks the group with the real device reported an improved life quality with the sound usually generated by tinnitus having decreased.Details of the device and research were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  In the event the U.S. were to launch a nuclear attack, the president does not hit a "nuclear button."Instead, a mid-level military officer usually travels with the president at all times, who carries the "Presidential Emergency Satchel" also called the "The Football," Popular Mechanics reports.Inside the satchel is a black book with a list of strike options, a three-by-five-inch card with presidential authentication codes to confirm his or her identity; a list of secure presidential bunkers and instructions for using the Emergency Broadcast System.In the event the president chooses the nuclear option, he consults with his advisers on what contingency plans to activate from the black book. Next, the president's identity is confirmed to strategic nuclear forces by reading a code off the three-by-five-inch card, known as "The Biscuit."The president's orders are then passed down the chain of command to U.S. bomber, missile and submarine crews around the world. The system is made to be fast, but also has some measures in place to mitigate impulsiveness.]]></description>

      <title>The world's coral reefs are dying much faster than you think</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE DEEP BLUE  Warming waters are hurting the world's coral reefs almost five times more than they did 30 years ago.New research, published in the journal Science, says that hotter waters caused by global has impaired reefs by causing them to bleach more frequently than they did in the 1980s.The study looked at 100 coral reefs and found that the frequency of bleaching had gone from once every few decades, to once every six years.According to the U.S. National Ocean Service, coral reefs are sessile animals fixed in place.  Bleaching occurs when the reef reacts to stressful changes in temperature, light, nutrients and other conditions. This makes the animal eject the symbiotic algae in their tissue and turn pale white. Corals can survive and even recover, but continued bleaching eventually leads to death.  Corals reefs are critical to the world's fish population and are important for tourism, coast protection against heavy storms, typhoons and even tsunamis. According to the World Wildlife, corals account for almost US$30 billion each in goods and services]]></description>

      <title>World's biggest offshore wind farm to be built in the North Sea</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NORTH SEA  A sand bank in the North Sea could be home to a vast offshore wind farm by 2027  possibly the world's largest.The Guardian reports that a Dutch energy company is planning to build a massive offshore wind farm on Dogger Bank in the North Sea, which will include an artificial island equipped with a runway, harbor, and other facilities.The turbines harness wind energy to generate alternating current, which will be sent via cables to the island. Since alternating currents incur power losses when transported over long distances, converters on the island will change it into direct current before transmitting it to the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Norway.The current largest offshore wind farm, the London Array, can produce 630 megawatts of power.

      <title>China aims for total surveillance with facial recognition technology</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  Facial recognition is popping up all over China, as the government looks to technology to keep track of its people and what they're up to.According to the Washington Post, Chinese apartments equipped with keyless entry use cameras to scan and verify residents' faces. But although convenient, the technology is also being used by authorities to monitor individuals and identify alleged 'bad guys' and persons of interest.The project, called 'Sharp Eyes', intends to connect public security cameras with those in private compounds and buildings, to form a nationwide surveillance and data-sharing network.Sharp Eyes' aim is to compile information on citizens, including criminal and medical records, travel and purchase history, and social media use, and link it to a face and identity card.Its name derives from a Communist slogan, and is linked to Chairman Mao's attempts to get citizens to spy on each other.Supposedly, the system can track suspicious behavior to help eliminate crime, which in China can be anything from homicide to speaking out against the government.Ultimately, the goal is for total surveillance, and in a country where being an ethnic minority or an activist can get you flagged, that prospect is frightening.]]></description>

      <title>SpaceX to put Tesla Roadster on board its most powerful rocket</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TITUSVILLE, FLORIDA  SpaceX is set to launch the world's most powerful rocket into deep space, and with it a most unusual cargo: Elon Musk's own car.Space reports that the Falcon Heavy rocket features three Falcon 9 engine-cores that are powered by 27 Merlin engines.The powerful rocket has 2,500 tons of thrust on liftoff, equal to 18 Boeing 747s at full throttle. Its maiden flight is scheduled for late January.The Falcon Heavy is designed to get large payloads into space, and opens up the possibility of sending manned missions to the moon or Mars. But Instead of putting in concrete or steel blocks to act as mass simulators, the payload will be a red Tesla Roadster.A lot of risk is associated with the rocket, which could blow up on ascent. If successful, the Tesla Roadster will be sent into Mars orbit, where it will remain for a billion years.On top of this, SpaceX is also aiming to land and recover all three of the Heavy's first-stage cores.]]></description>

      <title>Gang of wild turkeys harassing Rocky River mail carriers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ROCKY RIVER, OHIO  A big mess of wild turkeys are preventing mail carriers from delivering the mail west of Cleveland.  The Rocky River branch of the U.S. Postal Service let the city know that carriers in some parts of the city wouldn't be able to deliver the mail because of the hostile turkeys, according to Cleveland.com.For the past three weeks, around 25 to 30 homes haven't been getting any mail thanks to the aggressive turkeys. Mail carriers unfortunately don't have anything to scare the turkeys off, so people have had to end up going to the post office to get their mail. Unfortunately the city can't go all guns and glory on the feathered foes due to a city ordinance. The city has instead told residents not to leave out any kind of bird food. Too bad Thanksgiving is over.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ROCHESTER, NEW YORK  Kodak shares are now soaring after the company announced plans to get into the cryptocurrency business.BBC reports that Kodak is launching an image rights platform with its own blockchain. Photographers register their images and instantly get paid per use with the company's own virtual currency, called  Kodak coins.To guard against copyright infringement, Kodak software will continuously search the web for violations and take care of licensing.The company is set to host an initial coin offering on January 31.Kodak's other initiative is the Kash Miner, a bitcoin mining rig box equipped with processors and a fan, that uses the same amount of electricity as a continuously-running hair dryer.The machines will be rented out to customers for two years, with an upfront payment of $3,400, plus 50% of all proceeds generated by the machine from mining Bitcoin.According to the company, customers should be able to earn more than $300 a month, or $9,000 overall.Still, many are skeptical. Some critics believe Kodak is merely getting into cryptocurrency to raise stock prices. Whether that really is the case  guess we'll soon find out.]]></description>

It's been a roller coaster of a ride for former Breitbart head, to former chief strategist to President Stable Genius, back once again to former Breitbart head.Things were all sunshine and rainbows for the former kingmaker until Fire and Fury was unleashed across bookshelves after the most consensual president of our times gave it the old Streisand treatment. In the book, Trump comes off like, really smart with Bannon having nothing but praise for the Drumph team. Conservative mega-donor and minority Breitbart owner Rebekah Mercer was less than pleased, but especially with Bannon's lukewarm apology  which he took five days to issue.SiriusXM was also serious when they axed its relationship with Bannon.]]></description>

      <title>Oprah could be our next president</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  Oprah Winfrey is thinking about throwing her hat in the ring in 2020 according to two of her close friends, CNN Money reported. Oprah gave a moving speech at the Golden Globes on Sunday night, which has now led to speculation she could make a run for the White House. According to sources, several of Oprah's inner circle have been urging her to make a run. It's just talk for now, but all that talk is already dominating the headlines and social media. Right after her Golden Globes speech, #Oprah2020 began trending.  But Oprah lacks political and military experience. Obviously that no longer matters.Well, it should. When is America going to realize that we don't need TV stars pretending to be president. Another problem is that the Democrats literally have no one in the chamber to go up against Small Hands in 2020.More importantly, who should Oprah pick for her VP? Lebron or Steph?]]></description>

      <title>Idiot leaves hatch open, causes nuclear submarine to flood</title>

It's equipped with torpedos and ballistic missiles, and cost a whopping $2.9 billion.Back in February, some genius left an external hatch open while the submarine was at harbor, inevitably causing seawater to pour in once it dove underwater.The vessel's entire propulsion chamber got flooded as a result of the human error, and led to severe damage.Water had to be pumped out of the submarine and the pipes replaced, since they were exposed to corrosive seawater.The navy at least knows not to risk using damaged pipes to supply pressurized coolant to a nuclear reactor. Now if only they can improve basic training.]]></description>

Hargrave is an English teacher at Rene A. Rost Middle School in Kaplan, Louisiana.Board members were about to call a vote to give superintendent Jerome Puyau a $30,000 pay bump. What? A thirty grand increase for a superintendent?  In a 12-minute video posted online, Hargrave calmly addresses the board only to be humiliatingly handcuffed and arrested.

      <title>New coral sowing technique could help with reef restoration</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CURACAO  Researchers have found a new way to restore dying corals, using a method similar to how farmers scatter seedlings onto a field.With the world's corals deteriorating at an alarming rate, and restoration often slow and laborious, a team of scientists from nonprofit group Secore International has come up with a better approach to sowing corals.According to Secore, the new method involves harvesting coral larvae and planting them on tetrapod-shaped cement substrates. In a few weeks, the larvae will turn into coral polyps which can be sown on the reef. The seeding units don't require manual attachment and only need to be wedged into reef's crevices. One day, they can be sown from boats or by underwater drone.Twelve months after the sowing, the scientists found at least one coral growing on half the units.They believe the technique can sow 10,000 corals in just 50 working hours, compared to the hundreds or even thousands of hours needed for common restoration methods.The team is currently working to refine each step of their novel sowing approach.]]></description>

      <title>Here's how alligators survive the icy winter</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OCEAN ISLE BEACH, NORTH CAROLINA  A video released Monday shed light on the unique way alligators adapt to icy winter conditions. The Charlotte Observer reports that in the video, alligators in Shallotte River Swamp Park in North Carolina were seemingly frozen inside a pond, with only their snouts visible above the ice.Alligators are ectothermic, which means they don't generate their own body heat, and rely on the environment to regulate their internal temperature. Most gators live in temperate climates. But occasionally, a bomb cyclone brings in an icy winter and the scaly creatures have to deal.When temperatures reach freezing, gators are known to stick their snouts out of the water before the surface ices over.This allows them to continue breathing as they lower their body temperatures and metabolism, falling into a hibernating state in a process known as brumation.Once it becomes warm and the water thaws, the cold-blooded animals will slowly begin thermoregulating their body temperatures.Days after the frozen gator video made its rounds online, an update was posted showing the gators now out and about, though apparently still grumpy from their winter nap.]]></description>

      <title>Elon Musk attended a banging party by accident</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Elon Musk attended a party at a Silicon Valley investor's house that got a little out of hand. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO said he attended the now infamous sex party at investor Steve Jurvetson's residence, but that he didn't see anything naughty. Apparently, Musk thought it was going to be a costume party. He was at the party for a few hours and bounced around 1 a.m. after talking some shop. The party was mentioned in a Vanity Fair piece from Emily Chang's new book "Brotopia". In Chang's account, an anonymous "Jane Doe" said she saw a bunch of people cuddling and was offered some powdered goodies. In November, Jurvetson parted ways with his venture firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and took leave from the boards of Tesla and SpaceX, following an internal investigation.]]></description>

      <title>Lawsuit claims Google employees block conservative staff members</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO   Googlers detest working with white conservative dudes, that's according to the allegations made in a new discrimination lawsuit.The suit was filed by ex-Google staff James Damore and David Gudeman, both are white male conservatives.Damore wrote a 10-page internal memo titled "Google's Ideological Echo Chamber," with citations, slamming the company's diversity policies. That triggered an internal debate within Google and the memo somehow got leaked to the media. Damore was subsequently fired.Damore and Gudeman's lawsuit, if true, details a company culture where employees can block and actively avoid working with staff over political leanings. It also claims Googlers created a blacklist of big conservative media dudes not allowed on Google property.The lawsuit also tells of two employees  one who identifies as a "yellow scaled wingless dragonkin," and the other as an "expansive ornate building"  doing presentations at Google.The lawsuit also claims the Big G's internal forums has little on straight couples but is lit up with alternative lifestyles including furries and polygamy. It's worth bearing in mind here that this all coming from fired staff, and that Google  as massive as it is  is still a private company from San Francisco, California.And it's not just these dudes who are suing them. Several women have filed a joint suit against them citing gender pay discrimination nd Google is also the subject of a  U.S. Department of Labor investigation over whether it has breached equal pay laws.]]></description>

      <title>99% of north GBR sea turtles now female thanks to global warming</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GREAT BARRIER REEF, AUSTRALIA  Rising temperatures have caused a major downturn in male turtle populations in the northern Great Barrier Reef.A new study, published in the journal Current Biology, has found that 99 percent of sea turtles in the Pacific Ocean biggest green sea turtle rookery are female. Researchers say this is due to warming global temperatures.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a sea turtle's sex is temperature dependent. Males are born at around 27.7 degrees centigrade, while females are born at around 31 degrees centigrade.According to National Geographic, an area further south holds a ratio of two females to one male sea turtle.  Worldwide is around 3 to 1, reports National Geographic, citing research looking at 75 rookeries worldwide.]]></description>

      <title>What triggered deadly debris flows in California?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MONTECITO, CALIFORNIA  More than a dozen are dead after a torrent of mud and debris swept through California's Santa Barbara County last week.The Ventura County Star reports that this deadly and shockingly common occurrence is called a "debris flow," though it's also commonly called a mudslide.Often at risk for debris flows are mountainous areas that have been ravaged by wildfire. Fire kills vegetation and nutrients in the soil, causing it to become hydrophobic or water-repellant.During intense rainfall, water that would normally be absorbed into the ground instead saturates it and causes the earth to liquefy into a flowing river of mud.Debris flows grow in size as they pick up boulders, trees, and other debris, and are powerful enough to uproot or destroy entire neighborhoods.Many of the deaths in Montecito reportedly occurred while most residents were asleep, after heavy rain fell in a short period of time around 3:30 a.m.]]></description>

      <title>Stage I of Taipei's circular metro line to open in June of this year</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI, TAIWAN  Construction is underway for a circular metro line that passes through the densely populated areas of Taipei and New Taipei City. The line will connect with the existing lines of the Taipei Metro system.The Circular line  or Yellow line  is an elevated, medium-capacity rapid transit system. All stations are designed with natural lighting, transparency, and spaciousness in mind.Stage I of the line is about 15.4 km (9.6 mi) long and consists of 14 stations. Dapinglin station, an existing underground station on the green line of the Taipei metro will serve as a transfer station for the circular line.The circular line will connect Dapinglin station in southern New Taipei City to New Taipei Industrial Park, in the western part of the city. Jing'an, Banciao, Touqianzhuang, will also serve as transfer hubs to train station and other MRT lines, while New Taipei Industrial Park connects passengers to the Taoyuan Airport MRT line. The Circular line's 17 driverless trains each consists of four carriages with a total of 68 carriages manufactured by Hitachi Rail ItalyTo ensure safety and punctuality, CBTC radio signaling systems will be installed on board to allow train traffic to be managed via telecommunication. International architect Emmanuelle Moureaux, who specializes in large-scale color projects, has been commissioned to design the color scheme for the stations and carriages. Constructed by Taiwan's RSEA Engineering Corporation, stage I broke ground seven years ago at a reported estimated cost of US$1.8 billion(NT$54.7 billion). Stage I of the circular line is scheduled to open to the public in June 2018.]]></description>

      <title>Cranberries lead singer Dolores O'Riordan dies at age 46</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  Cranberries lead singer Dolores O'Riordan died suddenly on Monday in a London hotel room. She was only 46.The BBC reports that no details have been released regarding the cause of death, which is as yet unexplained.According to the Washington Post, O'Riordan's musical career began in 1990, when she answered a newspaper ad from Limerick City band The Cranberry Saw Us, and got hired as their lead singer.The group eventually changed their name to The Cranberries, and rose to international fame in the mid-90s with hits like 'Linger' and 'Zombie'.But despite shining in the spotlight, O'Riordan struggled with fame, and reportedly battled mental health issues behind closed doors.In 2003, a decade after they shot to mainstream success, the band separated to pursue individual careers.O'Riordan collaborated with other musicians before then launching a solo career with two albums.By 2009, the band had reunited, and was doing well. O'Riordan's personal life, though was decidedly not. She got a divorce, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after being involved in an air rage incident.The Cranberries had been set to go on tour after releasing a new album in 2017, but had to cancel performances in Europe and North America, citing O'Riordan's back problem, reports CNN.Fans around the world are mourning the loss of such an iconic singer, and are sending condolences to her ex-husband and three daughters.]]></description>

      <title>UAE says Qatari jets intercepted two commercial flights</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED ARAB EMIRATES  The United Arab Emirates said on Monday Qatari air force planes had intercepted two civilian aircraft en route to Bahrain, however Qatar denies the allegations. The UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, imposed travel, diplomatic and trade restrictions on Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of funding terrorism, Reuters reported. The UAE General Civil Aviation Authority said two Emirati airliners carrying 277 passengers were met by Qatari fighter jets while flying between UAE and Bahrain.One of the flights was intercepted at 10:30 a.m., and the second at 11:05 a.m. at between 9,000 and 10,000 feet. The report did not say when the incidents occurred.   The UAE described the event as "a serious and renewed breach of international conventions and the safety of civil aircraft traffic."Qatar's foreign ministry claims that UAE fighter jets violated its airspace on Dec. 21 and Jan. 3. UAE has denied the claim.]]></description>

      <title>Photographer's terrible editing job on family portraits goes viral</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI  A series of family photos caught the internet's attention, thanks to the photographer's "amazing" photo editing skills.When Facebook user Pam Dave Zaring paid $250 to a professional photographer for a family photo shoot, they didn't expect the end product would turn out to be worse than what they actually look like.After delivering the jaw-dropping photos, the photographer claimed the images were so terrible because the "shadows were really bad" on the beautiful, clear, and sunny day and her professor never taught her to retouch photos. Pam Dave Zaring later uploaded the photos to Facebook with the opening line "okay, this is not a joke." The post then quickly went viral and has been shared over 380,000 times since it was first posted on January 12. Some commenters felt this was a marketing stunt to promote the photographer's business. The Kansas City Star journalist Max Londberg did some research and found a LinkedIn account associated with the photography business under the name Lesa Hall, and according to the account, Lesa Hall of St.Louis, studied photography in college.  The photography business also has a Facebook page filled with photos done with the same editing approach. Even photos of the Donald didn't escape the Lesa Hall treatment.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GAZA  Israel announced on Sunday that it destroyed 'terror infrastructure' that infiltrated Israeli territory.According to the Israel Defense Forces, authorities detected a tunnel running from the Gaza strip into Israel and Egypt, reportedly built by militant group Hamas.Israel has claimed to have an advanced system for detecting tunnels underground, but did not provide details.The concrete tunnel passed under the Kerem Shalom crossing, the main passageway for goods entering Gaza, and was positioned near oil and gas pipelines.Authorities determined it was an attack tunnel, and could be used by militants to go to Egypt from Gaza, in order to attack Israel from the Sinai Peninsula.On Saturday, Israeli fighter jets launched an airstrike from the Gaza side that destroyed the tunnel.Three others have been destroyed in the last two months, with the military vowing to eliminate all Hamas attack tunnels by the end of 2018.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TARTUS, SYRIA  Russia claims to have identified the source of a drone attack that targeted two military bases in Syria.CNBC reports that the drones were launched from a village in southern Idlib province, by forces aiming to destroy Russian relations with Iran and Turkey, according to RT.On January 6, Russian defense forces detected 10 drones approaching Khmeimim Air base, and another three targeting a naval base in Tartus, Syria.The drones were assembled using a simple engine and cheap materials.

      <title>Campaigns look to end plastic straw use &#x2014; good luck</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA  Plastic straws are increasingly drawing attention from conservation movements around the world. In the U.S. alone, Americans discard around 500 million plastic straws a day, enough to circle the globe twice, or fill 125 school buses, according to CNN. Straws normally are not recycled because they are often made from several different types of plastics, and they're small in size. Straw pollution contributes to the eight million tons of plastic dumped into the oceans each year, CNN reported. At the current rate, there will be more plastic than fish in the water by 2050. Campaigns in the U.S. and the U.K. have looked to reduce plastic straw use. Reusable glass straws, stainless steel, copper and bamboo all more sustainable alternatives than single-use plastic.]]></description>

By everything, we mean all the clothes that wouldn't fit in his checked luggage. That's 10 shirts and eight pairs of pants.

      <title>Japanese grocery accidentally sells poisonous blowfish meat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GAMAGORI, JAPAN  An emergency warning was sent out in a coastal city in Japan on Monday after packages of fugu were mistakenly sold to customers.The Japan Times reports that a grocery store in Gamagori accidentally sold five packages of assorted fugu or blowfish meat with its poisonous parts still intact.Three of the packages have been recovered, but two have yet to be found.The liver and internal organs of blowfish are known to contain tetrodotoxin, a lethal neurotoxin 1,200 times more potent than cyanide. One fish has enough poison to kill 30 adult humans, according to National Geographic.Tetrodotoxin targets motor neurons, causing numbness in the lips, loss of muscle control, and organ paralysis. A fatal dose could lead to respiratory arrest and death. There is no known antidote.Despite the danger, blowfish meat is a delicacy in Japan. But because of the high risk, only rigorously trained and licensed chefs are allowed to prepare the deadly dish.There are still those who die from blowfish poisoning, though these are mostly amateur cooks or sport fishermen who try to cut the fish up themselves.]]></description>

      <title>The meanings behind the tattoos on arrested Yakuza boss' body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOPBURI, THAILAND  Thai police recently arrested fugitive Japanese yakuza boss Shigeharu Shirai after pictures of his tattoos went viral on Facebook.The 74-year-old Yakuza boss fled his country after he was allegedly involved in shooting a rival gang member in 2003. Shirai's tattoos led to his internet fame when someone uploaded a photo of him playing a checkers game. Other pictures showed that Shirai is missing a part of his little finger, that is the result of Yubitsume[c], a self-administered punishment when Japanese yakuza gangs make a mistake or break a gang's code.While people are intrigued by Shirai's body art, tattoos were actually used as punishment for criminals in ancient Japan as it would make it difficult for them to re-enter society after they are released from the prison. However, the yakuzas see tattoos as a mark of pride as there are meanings behind each one.The samurai on Shirai's back is quite common among yakuza folks, it represents the samurai code: honour, courage, loyalty, and proper action. The flower on his nipple could mean three different things: a peony, lotus, or chrysanthemum. A peony represents wealth, elegance and prosperity, it also can relate to masculinity or a daredevil attitude. The lotus in Buddhist culture means the struggle for something to reach its full potential. A chrysanthemum represents the Imperial family and links to longevity and joy.According to Kotaku, the flower has yet to be coloured on Shirai's abdominal area is  called sujibori, a tattoo that has an unfinished story, while the water tattoo element on his lower back illustrates change, adaptation and life.According to Thai authorities, Shirai will be charged with illegally entering Thailand and then deported to Japan to face murder charges.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TEPOSCOLULA-YUCUNDAA, MEXICO  Scientists have come one step closer to unlocking the secrets of an centuries-old contagion.New research published in Nature Ecology and Evolution details a study looking at teeth from the remains of 29 skeletons at a centuries old burial site in Teposcolula-Yucundaa.Those at the burial site are said to have died during the cocoliztli outbreak, a 1545 epidemic that killed millions.The study linked the DNA found at Teposcolula-Yucundaa with a subspecies of Salmonella enterica connected to the deadly enteric typhoid fever. The cocoliztli outbreak lasted from 1545 to 1550. According to National Geographic, another study from 2017 found the same bacteria on the remains of a Norwegian woman who passed in 1200.But whether or not the Mexican outbreak was from colonial Europeans remains unknown.]]></description>

      <title>China wants to blow up space junk using giant lasers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[XI'AN, CHINA  China has come up with a new plan to rid the Earth of its space garbage, using giant lasers.Wired reports that Earth's orbit is currently cluttered with fragments from old satellites and rocket stages, called space debris, which number at least 20,000.Satellites and spacecrafts are frequently at risk of colliding with the fragments and being damaged by even small, pebble-sized pieces.To address this problem, Chinese researchers from the Air Force Engineering University in Xi'an have proposed a plan to launch a satellite-mounted laser that will emit short bursts of infrared light to target small debris. The laser will break down the space debris into tiny, harmless particles, and hopefully rid the Earth of its space junk.The plan sounds reasonable enough, but of course, with China, there's no telling if the space laser will actually be for cleaning, or be used as a tool for world domination.]]></description>

      <title>Texas middle school student denied lunch for 50 cent debt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FORT BEND COUNTY, TEXAS  A Texas mom says her 12-year-old son was denied school lunch from a cafeteria worker because of a debt less than a buck. Sixth-grader Matt Williams says he refused lunch at James Bowie Middle School for having a negative account balance of 50 cents.  "I was hungry, my head hurted, I felt kind of dizzy a little bit," Matt told KIAH. Apparently, before the Christmas break, Matt was trying to get a drink and a bag of chips. When it got time to pay, the lunch lady told him he didn't have anymore money left on his account and that he was out of luck. According the Matt and his mom, students and even faculty often carry negative balances and can still get food.  The principal has since reached out to Matt's mom to apologize.]]></description>

      <title>Your car is spying on you. Here's how</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  You probably know your phone is spying on you, but what you might not realize is that your car is doing it too.The Washington Post reports that connected cars can track and monitor location, driving habits, fuel usage, and even music preferences, and relay this information back to automakers.The data is supposedly meant to update car features and improve safety, and in some cases help law enforcement evaluate accidents or crashes.But it can also put consumers at risk. Location data can be used to infer sensitive information about a person's health, religion, or political affiliation, and a unique profile can be developed with enough data points.With no car privacy rule to regulate them, automakers can partner with data firms, and generate revenue when the information is sold to third party companies.Car companies technically inform customers about the data collection, but they're often buried in lengthy contracts.Despite claims that driver data is not shared without consent, a lack of transparency means customers don't know what happens to their data and how exactly it is used.]]></description>

      <title>Cape Town could run out of water in 90 days</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA  One of the biggest cities in South Africa may soon become the first major city in the world to run out of water.Cape Town is facing a water crisis, and has less than a hundred days before "Day Zero" on April 21, when the water supply is expected to run out, according to the South African.Years of extreme drought have caused storage levels in dams to drop below 30%. Once it falls to 13.5%, taps in the city will be shut off.Local authorities restricted water usage to 87 liters per person per day, but after only 39% of residents complied, the limit has now been lowered to 50 liters.Its four million residents are being told to take 2-minute showers, and have been banned from filling pools, watering gardens, or washing cars.Households that go over their water allowance will also be asked to pay higher tariffs.After "Day Zero", citizens will need to line up at one of 200 water collection points throughout the city, where each can collect a maximum of 25 liters a day.Authorities have also been looking into alternative ways to source water, like wastewater recycling, drilling into aquifers, or seawater desalination.]]></description>

      <title>Skyscraper-sized asteroid set to pass close to Earth in Feb 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  A massive space rock will fly past Earth in February  the largest that's expected to come close to the planet this year. Newshub reports that asteroid 2002 AJ129 is 1.1 kilometers wide, making it slightly longer than the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building.The asteroid is hurtling through space at a speed of more than 107,000 kilometers per hour, 15 times faster than the hypersonic X-15 aircraft.It is set to pass within 4.2 million kilometers from Earth on February 4, 2018, a distance NASA considers 'potentially dangerous' despite a low chance of a direct hit.If an asteroid this size were to collide with Earth, studies suggest debris could cloud up the atmosphere, blocking the sun and causing temperature drops that could trigger a mini ice age.NASA is currently incapable of intercepting an asteroid beelining straight for Earth. That technology won't be ready until after 2024.Best keep your fingers crossed that no giant space rocks decide to come knocking til then.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese iPhone workers allegedly exposed to toxic substances</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SUQIAN, CHINA  Workers at an Apple iPhone suppliers' factory in Suqian, China are exposed to toxic substances, according to an investigation.The report by New York-based China Labour Watch has criticised Chinese factory employees working at Apple supplier Catcher Technology work 10 hour days, six days per week.The report also claims that the workers face exposure to toxic substances. It claims some workers hands aren't adequately protected by the provided gloves and that protective ear plugs and eye wear are not always available.China Labour Watch says that some employees' eyes have experienced vision issues from cutting fluid and that noise in the factory can cause irreversible hearing damage.The report also claims the factory's wastewater was directly dispensed into the public sewage system. Analysis of this found that it exceeded local standards for water quality.In May last year, the report says 90 were sent to hospital following a chemical leak at the plant, and that five were in intensive care as a result. Investigation of the incident by the Administrative Committee of the Suzhou-Suqian Industrial Park said the cause was a mechanical failure, notes the report.Apple told the Guardian it investigated these claims, interviewed 150 factory workers and found no violations of it's code of conduct. The tech giant told the paper that workers were provided with protective equipment and that wastewater was treated appropriately.]]></description>

      <title>Cashier-free Amazon Go store opens to the public</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  Amazon's first cashier-free store in Seattle is now open to the public, nearly 14 months after it began a trial run for company employees.The New York Times reports that customers enter the Amazon Go store via an app on their phones, which generates a QR code that is scanned on an electronic turnstile.Cameras mounted on the ceiling do not have facial recognition technology, instead detecting motion and sensing depth to track shoppers through the store.This, combined with weight sensors on the shelves, helps the system identify what items are being picked up by which shopper.Once an item is taken off a shelf, it is added to a customer's virtual cart. If an item is picked up but later returned, the system removes it from the cart.Once the customer finishes shopping and leaves the store, the cost of items in the cart is calculated, and the total amount charged directly to the linked Amazon account.Despite having no checkout and no cashiers, the store has staff to check the IDs of shoppers purchasing alcohol. Employees are also on hand to restock shelves and prepare the store's ready-to-eat meals.Amazon has said it might open more Amazon Go stores in the future, but the plans are not immediate, and the company wants to focus on its flagship store for now.]]></description>

      <title>Compact nuclear power system 
could sustain life on Mars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARS  NASA is testing a nuclear fission reactor prototype that could enable long-term stays on the surface of the red planet.The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that the first humans on Mars will need to be able to generate power to transform the planet's water and carbon dioxide into liquid oxygen and fuel.To enable such a feat, NASA and the Department of Energy have come up with the Kilopower project, a nuclear power system that comes with a Uranium reactor core, which uses fission to generate electricity.Kilopower can generate 1 kilowatt of electricity, which can power a toaster, to 10 kilowatts, which can light up 100 bulbs.Four to five 10-kilowatt units will be needed to power the habit- charging vehicles, generating safe drinking water, and oxygen.The months-long testing for the kilopower prototype began in November at a Department of Energy National Security Site in Nevada.Though a flight test is at least six to eight years away, if all goes well, the technology could be ready by the mid-2020s to early 2030s.]]></description>

      <title>Bat researchers discover how brain maps where others are</title>
      <description><![CDATA[REHOVOT, ISRAEL  New research on bats published in the journal Science provides insights into how the brain maps the social geography of areas.Researchers trained pairs of bats, with one alpha male labelled as a teacher and the other a student, to retrieve fruit from a stand inside a room. They noted how student typically tracked the teacher's path toward the fruit.The bats were fitted with technology to record brain cell activity. Activity was normal in students bats acting on their own, but fired when tracking the position of the teacher. Researchers believe this was social place-cells in the hippocampus.Students bats also tracked objects like balls and dice but their brain activity responded differently. Researchers suspect this could provide insights into how that the brain cognitively maps out the environment socially, and physically.]]></description>

      <title>Brain-wasting zombie deer disease could strike humans next</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FORT COLLINS, COLORADO  A mysterious neurological disease is laying waste to North American deer, and scientists worry humans are next.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that since its discovery in 1967, chronic wasting disease has infected deer populations in 24 US states and Canada, and has also been found in South Korea and Norway.Chronic wasting disease is caused by prions, deformed proteins which accumulate in certain organs. Infected deer can live two years before symptoms like weight loss, thick saliva, and behavioral changes manifest, according to the CWD Alliance.The disease is contagious, and typically spreads via the saliva and feces of diseased deer, which can contaminate the environment and infect other animals.Prion diseases are typically limited to certain species, but may evolve to overcome the interspecies barrier and infect new hosts.Mad Cow Disease is one example, with humans contracting the disease from eating cows that had been infected by prions from sheep.While no humans have been infected by CWD, monkeys in a recent study reportedly contracted the disease after ingesting infected deer meat.Public health officials continue to monitor for any sign of brain-wasting diseases in humans. They have also warned hunters not to consume deer meat without getting it tested, regardless of how healthy the animal looks.]]></description>

      <title>Delta cracking down on fake service pets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ATLANTA, GEORGIA  Delta is tightening its regulations for passengers who travel with emotional-service pets. If an airline as crappy as Delta is doing something, it must be a problem. Delta says it's seen a big uptick in incidents involving poorly trained animals since 2016. More and more the airline is getting complaints of animals taking a leak, dropping deuces and even biting other passengers. Starting on March 1, passengers traveling with service pets need to show Delta proof of health or vaccinations for the animal 48 hours before flying.People traveling with emotional- or psychological-support animals will need a signed note from a doctor confirming the animal won't go berserk. In the past, Delta said passengers who have tried to use turkeys, possums, snakes and even spiders as support pets. From now on, if you're looking to bring hedgehogs, ferrets, insects, rodents, snakes spiders, possums, amphibians, non-household fowl or animals with horns, tusks or hooves on a flight, you're going to have to find someone other than Delta.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[FRESNO, CALIFORNIA  A sushi fanatic from Fresno ended up with a 5-foot-long tapeworm, and doctors think the ridiculous amounts of raw fish may be the reason.  The man went to the the ER and complained about bloody stool. The doctors did not think anything particular was up until the dude pulled out a tapeworm from a grocery bag. Turns out the tapeworm was actually 5-and-a-half feet long. The man said it felt like his guts were coming out on the can. He then tried to grab the little fellow, but it started moving.The CDC had released reports of contaminated Alaskan salmon being infected with Japanese broad tapeworm parasites. The man and his doctor figured out it was his daily feast of salmon sashimi that was most likely the cause. The guy is now taking medication and has given up sushi  for now.]]></description>

She eventually was busted at Heathrow when she was unable to present a passport.Hartman was put on a flight and sent straight back to Chicago. She's now being held on a $25,000 bond, and has to wear an ankle monitor to keep her away from any airports.]]></description>

      <title>Moscow testing a 100-megaton torpedo nuke, says Pentagon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A leaked draft of a Pentagon document suggests that Russia is working on an underwater thermonuclear torpedo.First reported by the Washington Free Beacon, the project  codenamed "Kanyon" by the Pentagon  was conceived to target coastal areas, naval bases and sea ports. The weapon is believed to operate autonomously, the New York Times reported, citing officials. Russia reportedly refers to the device as "Ocean Multipurpose System Status-6".According to Popular Mechanics, the weapon operates like a drone. It has a range of 6,200 miles, can dive to over 3000 feet and travel at 100 knots (around 115 mph). The warhead measures 5.5 feet wide and is 79 feet long, reported Popular Mechanics, citing submarine expert H. I. Sutton.The device can also wield a 100 megaton nuclear payload and reportedly has the radioactive isotope Cobalt-60, meaning area struck by it would be dangerous to humans for around a century. It is being tested by the Russian Navy on a Sarov-class submarine which carries it on its pressure hull, reported Popular Mechanics.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BENTON, KENTUCKY  Two are dead and 17 others injured after a teenage boy opened fire inside a Kentucky school.The Lexington Herald Leader reports that the incident at Marshall County High School in Benton, Kentucky began just before 8 a.m., when a shooter started firing at students in the common area.The rampage continued as the students ran for cover. A 15-year-old girl was shot and killed on the scene, while more than a dozen others were wounded.Five shooting victims were airlifted to a Nashville hospital, where one boy later died from head wounds. The four others are expected to survive after being shot in the head, arm, chest, and abdomen.Police have apprehended the 15-year-old male suspect, who will be charged with murder and attempted murder.The gunman's identity has not been disclosed since he's still a juvenile, but will likely be made public if the case is moved to adult court.At least nine US school shootings have been reported so far in 2018, but the incident in Kentucky is the year's first fatal school shooting.]]></description>

      <title>Artificially cooling the planet may do more harm than good</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COLLEGE PARK, MARYLAND  Scientists are looking to engineer the climate to fight global warming. But a new study shows it may do more harm than good.AFP reports that stratospheric aerosol injection is a form of geoengineering that involves spraying sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to form clouds that reflect solar radiation.Using computer models, a study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution found that spraying 5 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide above the equator every year for 50 years could drop surface temperatures by one degree Celsius.But if sulfur seeding is suddenly stopped, the planet would warm rapidly, with temperatures rising several times faster than the predicted rate.Plant populations would die out, and wildlife, especially amphibians and land animals, wouldn't be able to migrate quickly enough. The loss of just one species could impact an entire ecosystem.It just goes to show how tricky it is to mess with something as unpredictable as climate. So despite all the benefits we think geoengineering might bring, we're probably better off focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.]]></description>

      <title>Super Blue Blood Moon to bring Earth a 'lunar trifecta': NASA</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOON  NASA says Earth is in for a lunar trifecta of a "super blue blood moon" on January 31, 2018.Lunar orbit of Earth follows a 29-day cycle. The blue moon, like the one on January 31, occurs when there are two full moons in a calendar month.The moon will also be close to Earth during this time, meaning it will be brighter than normal. This is called a supermoon. When the moon passes through the Earth's shadow during the Jan. 31 lunar eclipse it will appear red. This creates the blood moon.Most of Asia, Australasia and the northwestern America will be able to see this super blue blood moon, while much of South America, Africa and West Europe will not.The rest of the world will be able to see it partially depending on their location.The last time a total lunar eclipse to coincided with a blue moon was in 1982, reports Time, citing NASA programmer Ernest Wright and ex-NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak.]]></description>

      <title>China successfully clones first monkeys from transferred DNA</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI  China has cloned monkeys using transferred DNA, possibly paving the way for human cloning.Nature reports that biologists in Shanghai have cloned two genetically identical macaques using the same technique that produced Dolly the Sheep.Somatic cell nuclear transfer involves taking the nucleus of a cell, which contains its genetic material, and injecting it into an egg that has had its own nucleus removed.The egg cell is then treated with enzymes to stimulate embryo development, just like a naturally fertilized egg.In all, the researchers created 109 embryos and implanted them into 21 surrogate monkeys, resulting in six pregnancies but only two live births.The macaques, named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, aren't the first primates to be cloned though  that distinction belongs to Tetra, a rhesus monkey created using a simpler embryo-splitting method.The Chinese team believes the monkey clones could be useful in medical research, specifically in the study of genetic diseases like Parkinson's or autism.]]></description>

      <title>Ring of Fire is ACTIVE, warns United Nations</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE PACIFIC  Recent volcanic and seismic activity in various Pacific Ocean nations prompted the UN to warn that the "Ring of Fire" is active.The warning, posted to the official UN Office of Disaster Risk Reduction Twitter feed, comes after eruptions and earthquakes hit areas in the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and Alaska this week.As the naming implies, it is a ring of hundred of volcanoes spanning 25,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean. Much of it was created through the subduction of tectonic plates.This is where oceanic crust of the earth clashes with heavier continental plates, and is forced underneath them due to the weight, reports DW. The resulting pressure is explosive and results in magma eruptions and earthquakes.Because of these subduction zones, the Ring of Fire is home to 452 volcanoes and around 90 percent of the world's earthquakes.]]></description>

      <title>How the flu can kill</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AMERICA  The flu season in the U.S. this year has been particularly harsh, already having claimed the lives of at least 30 children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   Although most people do not die from the flu, young children and people with other illnesses, such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes are at elevated risks. Adults can succumb to the flu in three ways: pneumonia, sepsis and heart attack. Pneumonia can develop in a person who is infected with influenza.Pneumonia causes the small air sacs of the lungs to fill with fluid or pus, sometimes leading to death. With sepsis, the influenza virus can trigger the body to release chemicals into the blood to fight infection that triggers inflammation throughout the body. That inflammation can then trigger multiple organ system failure. The third way the flu kills adults is by triggering heart attacks. A new study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a person is six times more likely to have a heart attack during the week after being diagnosed with the flu, compared to the year before or after the infection. Experts are urging people to get flu shots, even though it may not always prevent an infection from the flu virus.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BOSCAWEN, NEW HAMPSHIRE  A New Hampshire man bit a police dog while resisting arrest, and let's just say it didn't end well.Fox News reports that state troopers responding to a shooting incident had managed to detain three people, before being told a fourth one was hiding in a trailer on the property.The suspect ignored repeated commands to surrender, prompting the homeowner to break a glass door to gain entry.K9 Veda entered the trailer while the suspect was trying to hide under some clothes. After kicking and punching the dog and troopers, he got Veda in a chokehold and bit her on the head.The dog didn't like that one bit, and promptly returned the favor. Troopers tasered the suspect and finally brought him in.Veda has been cleared medically and is back on the job. Can't say the same for the perp, who really should've known better than to out-bite a trained K9.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SOMEWHERE IN CHINA  A man in China who was out shopping for an iPhone battery decided to bite it to see if it was real. Thought that only worked with gold.   Einstein was reportedly at an electronics store somewhere in China shopping for a replacement battery last Friday. Apparently in China, you bite into things to see if they're fake. It's even better when the thing you're biting into contains battery acid. The Chinese guy finds a battery and decides to go to town on it like it's chicken chow mein. The jaws of fury then cause an explosion that hilariously envelopes the man's head. Unfortunately, the guy made it through the accident with only his ego destroyed.]]></description>

      <title>SDV 1000W: South Korea's 10-person military submersible</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL  The South Korean Navy has a submersible that also doubles as a surface vessel.According to Korean Naval manufacturer VOGO, the vessel can be deployed via airdrop from a C-17 or C-130 aircraft. It can carry a crew of 10. On the surface the SDV 1000W can travel at 35 knots, or 40 mph via diesel engines and waterjet propulsors. While submerged it can travel at 6 knots or 7 mph using lithium polymer batteries and silent electric motors.Submarine expert H I Sutton reports that the vessel functions like a wet-sub, in that the crew still wear diving gear and receive oxygen from a sizeable on-board air system. This lets passengers exit underwater, but the vessel can also be run up a beach.]]></description>

      <title>Recurring snowfall on the Sahara evidence of global warming?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[VLADIVOSTOK, RUSSIA  Recurring snowfalls on one of the hottest places on Earth stems from global warming, says a top Russian meteorologist.The Russian News Agency reports that on January 7, a blanket of snow fell on the Sahara desert, near the northern Algerian town of Ain Sefra.The Sahara has been known to get as hot as 122 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. But while temperatures drop at night, it's unusual to see snow due to the dry air.In 1979, snow fell in the area for 30 minutes. It was 37 years before the next snowfall, but only a year passed between then and the most recent one, which saw 15 inches of snow cover.According to Roman Vilfand, Head of Russia's Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, the frequency of such an unusual weather phenomenon is evidence that global warming is on the rise. He adds that the same is true the current cold spell in the eastern US, an unusually warm Russian winter, and rainfall and flooding in Western EuropeWith the state of the climate as dismal as it is and with no signs of improvement, guess there'll be more extreme weather in our future.

      <title>Flat-Earther still planning to launch self in homemade rocket</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FLAT EARTH  Remember Mad Mike Hughes? Of course not, why would you.A few months ago, Mike made headlines over the flat Earth when he tried to raise money to launch himself in a homemade steam powered rocket a mile across the Mojave Desert.The plan was to shoot himself high enough to see that the Earth is just a disc. Unfortunately, paperwork and mechanical failures stopped the November launch from happening. Mike went back to the drawing board and redesigned his rocket and now says he's good to go on February 3. The plan is to fly straight up for a third of a mile and then let gravity take over. But does gravity really exist? Hughes eventually says he wants to shoot himself up 52 miles in the air by year's end to see for himself the shape of the Earth.  He says it'll cost him $2 million for the hot-air balloon, rocket pack and space suit to get him to his vantage point. Maybe Mike should hit up Kyrie Irving or  J.J.

      <title>Hackers using YouTube ads for cryptomining</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  Hackers are using YouTube as a way to turn passive viewers into cryptocurrency miners, according to cybersecurity firm Trend Micro.The issue was brought to light at the beginning of the week over social media with complaints that YouTube ads were raising red flags in anti-virus software, Mashable reported. A service called Coinhive was apparently taking over a viewer's CPU and using it to mine digital coins. According to Trend Micro, attackers used Google's DoubleClick ad software for traffic distribution.Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy and Spain were affected by the malvertising campaign. Google confirmed the cryptojacking threat, and eventually blocked the ads and removed the "malicious actors" from their platform.]]></description>

      <title>Raw pork delivered in shopping carts sparks investigation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA  Photos of raw meat being handled under iffy conditions at a California supermarket have gone viral, sparking disgust and outrage among netizens.The San Jose Mercury News reports that Loretta Seto was about to shop at 99 Ranch Market in San Jose when she spotted two men delivering slabs of raw, unwrapped pork in shopping carts. Seto snapped a photo of the carts and put it up on Facebook, along with a warning that the carts came from a Costco across the street. Assuming the carts were returned uncleaned, that means countless customers have probably been contaminated with nasty meat germs and don't even know it.Responding to the post, the market claims they've dumped the pork in the photos, but deny involvement and say they've filed a complaint with the vendor.That vendor is Jim's Farm Meat Co. in Winton, who in turn claims the meat left their facility wrapped and in a combo bin. They're not sure if the delivery method was a request from 99 Ranch, but are looking into the matter and have since fired the two delivery men.An investigation is also being carried out by the Santa Clara Department of Environmental Health, who caught wind of the issue from Seto's post.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. soldiers are accidentally leaking intel through fitness apps</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Information about location and staffing of U.S. military bases around the world has been revealed by a fitness-tracking company.The data was released by Strava in a data map that indicates all the activity tracked by users of the fitness app, the Guardian reported. The Global Heat Map published by Strava uses satellite information to plot the location and movements of its users over a two-year period by lighting up areas of activity. The app can be used on smartphones or fitness trackers to see running popular routes in cities, or track people in remote areas. Military analysts discovered over the weekend the data also reveals sensitive information about U.S. soldiers on active service. Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Institute for United Conflict Analysts, first discovered the oversight. "If soldiers use the app like normal people do, by turning it on tracking when they go to do exercise, it could be especially dangerous," Ruser said. In locations like Afghanistan, Djibouti and Syria, Strava users are almost all foreign military personnel, meaning their bases stand out brightly. Strava apps and devices can have their location services turned off. The company issued a statement urging users to visit their website to make sure they fully understand the privacy settings.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The U.S. Secret Service this week issued an alert, warning banks about an ATM exploit known called "jackpotting."According to online security blogger and journalist Brian Krebs, the Secret Service has been warning banks that attacks are taking place in the USA. Krebs, citing the Secret Service alert, reports that thieves use an endoscope attached to a phone to find an internal part of the ATM that'll connect with their laptop.After that, the cash machine appears as Out of Service and will be in control of the thieves, according to the Secret Service alert reported by Krebs. They can order the ATM to dispense currency to a collector, or "money mule", at a rate of 40 bills per 23 seconds.The Secret Service alert warms the exploit targets ATMs inside pharmacies and big box retailers as well as drive-thru ATMs, according to Krebs.]]></description>

      <title>Russian jet flies within 5 feet of U.S. Navy plane over Black Sea</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BLACK SEA  A Russian jet unsafely intercepted a U.S. Navy plane, the latest in a series of close calls between the two countries over the Black Sea.According to a press release from the U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, a U.S. EP-3 plane was conducting a reconnaissance mission in international airspace over the Black Sea on Monday when it encountered a Russian aircraft.The Russian military reportedly detected an unidentified aircraft approaching their airspace, and sent a Sukhoi SU-27 fighter jet to intercept it.The SU-27 came within five feet of the U.S. plane, crossing directly in front and causing it to fly through a trail of turbulent air.The intercept lasted a total of 2 hours and 40 minutes.According to the Pentagon, the EP-3 did not do anything to provoke the Russians, and that such actions increase the risk of miscalculation and mid-air collisions.But Russia's Defense Ministry denies any wrongdoing, claiming its jet flew in accordance with international law when it intercepted the U.S. plane, reports CNN.]]></description>

      <title>Trump team considers nationalizing 5G network</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  National security officials in the Trump administration are considering nationalizing a part of the country's mobile network to protect it against China, Axios reported. A PowerPoint and memo made by a senior National Security Council were obtained by Axios. The documents suggest the U.S. needs a centralized nationwide 5G network within three years. The government could pay for and build a single network or it could have wireless providers build their own 5G networks. The presentation talked about the need to build a network in order to compete with China's dominant position in the manufacture and operation of network infrastructure. The documents say that it would be faster for the government to build a network and then rent access to carriers like AT&T and Verizon.  They also argue that a secure 5G network is vital for the development of emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles or virtual reality, as well as to counter Chinese threats to US economic and cyber security.]]></description>

      <title>United bounces lady enroute to visit dying mother</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PUEBLO, COLORADO  United demonstrated how to #flythefriendlyskies last week once again, this time by ejecting a woman enroute to see her dying mom. Last week Carrol Amrich was flying from Colorado to Minnesota to see her dying mom. According to the New York Times, she checked in, scanned her ticket at the gate and got on the plane. According to the New York Times, the ticket was bought by Amrich's landlord Ines Preslas via Traveller Help Desk, and then changed to an earlier flight through United Airlines when they heard Amrich's mother's condition had gotten worse.But while she was strapped in, a gate agent came to remove her and said her ticket was refunded. "Nobody flies for free", the gate said to her, Amrich told the Times.Back in the airport, Amrich called Prelas and put her onto the gate agent. Prelas offered to pay for the ticket again via credit card, saying they could work out the details later. Sadly though the flight left, without Amrich.Next, Amrich drove 1,000 miles without stopping in a last ditch attempt to see her moribund mother, but by the time she got there her mom was gone. A customer rep for Traveller Help Desk told the Times by email that they were sorry for Amrich's loss, and had they been contacted directly all of this could've been avoided.Prelas said a United rep explained that changing the ticket through them wouldn't cause any problem, even though it had been booked through an online travel agency.]]></description>

      <title>Frozen meteor collected by villagers actually airplane feces</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FAZILPUR BADLI VILLAGE, INDIA  Indian villagers found what they thought was a frozen meteor, but turns out it was actually frozen feces.The frozen "meteor" reportedly crashed into a farmer's field on Saturday. Meteors can be worth lots of money, so people flocked to the field and gathered pieces of the rock to stash them in their refrigerators. The yellow-brown "meteor" was said to be around 20 pounds and had a transparent surface that resembled ice. A group of scientists from India's Meteorological Department conducted research on the samples of the "meteor", and surprise  the meteor was actually frozen human feces.Folks later learned that their refrigerators were preserving airplane poop this whole time,  so they had to clean everything in their houses that had come in contact with the "meteor".Aviation experts said human waste that leaks or is discarded from the sewage system of an airplane usually turns into clumps ice in the time that it takes to reach the ground.]]></description>
