      <title>Here's how the Bitcoin bubble could pop</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  Cryptocurrency Bitcoin swelled to $11,000 per coin on Wednesday, prompting intense speculation about the latest bubble and how and why it could soon pop.According to Bloomberg, developers divided on how to upgrade the Bitcoin network have led to fragmentation of the original currency into different versions, too much of which could be a problem. Bitcoin's history of being used to buy illicit materials from the dark web means regulators are watching and could crackdown any time, especially if it grows big enough to impact a nation's monetary policy.As an intangible asset, Bitcoins have previously been targeted by hackers, and may again fall victim to digital theft.Though the value bitcoin is volatile, at the moment, it's at an all-time high. But because the supply is virtually limitless, there is a risk of collapse in value if demand should ever go down.Experts have likened the bitcoin craze to the dotcom bubble, Tulip Mania, and other economic bubbles  all of which burst spectacularly.If they're to be believed, Bitcoin's downward spiral is only a matter of time.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[LONDON, UK  Meghan Markle, the Suits star will soon become a member of the British royal family after her recent engagement with Prince Harry, however, the TV star will not be known as Princess Meghan when she ties the knot with Prince Harry next year.Markle does not have royal blood in her ancestry, same as her future-sister-in-law, Catherine Middleton, who was later named Her Royal Highness, Princess William of Wales.Royal blood is the key to determining how a princess is named.

      <title>Giant asteroid 3200 Phaethon will pass close to Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA has announced that a giant space rock will be passing close to Earth next month, but assures everyone that the fly-by is friendly, and not cause for concern.CBS reports that 3200 Phaethon is an asteroid with a diameter of 3 miles that has been labelled 'potentially dangerous' because its orbit crosses paths with the Earth.Phaeton will be the closest to Earth on December 16, when it is projected to be within 6.4 million miles or 27 lunar distances of our planet. It hasn't gotten this close since 1974, and isn't expected to swing by again until 2093.Phaethon may be named after a Greek demigod who nearly destroyed Earth, but those worried about a catastrophic collision can rest easy, since the giant rock is in a relatively stable orbit, and isn't a threat.Astronomers believe the asteroid to be the parent body for the annual Geminid meteor shower, which happens when the Earth passes through Phaethon's debris field.]]></description>

      <title>Origami inspired soft robotic limbs are crazy strong</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University have developed origami-inspired artificial muscles that can lift up to one thousand times their own weight. The devices could be used on next-generation soft robots, to be deployed within the body or outer space, the LA Times reported. The scientists wanted to make robots that were soft and compliant yet had strength similar to hard-bodied systems. The group used origami techniques to create muscle-like devices that could allow for limb flexibility without the need for hard parts. They made devices that could shorten, curl, twist or bend when compressed and sealed them in a polymer bag and filled them with air or other fluids. Vacuuming the air out then allowed for movement to grip, lift and twist objects. The team discovered the origami muscles could squeeze down to a tenth of their original size or lift up to a thousand times their own weight. Soft robotic limbs could be used in the future on small scales within the body or on large scales for outer space construction.]]></description>

      <title>Robots are stealing all the good jobs</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA  Looks like 400 to 800 million people worldwide could be out of a job by 2030 thanks to good old automation. McKinsey Global Institute looked at 800 different jobs across 46 countries and found up to 20 percent of the global workforce could get kicked to the curb. Wealthy countries like the US and Germany will have to retrain about one-third of their workforces. Factory workers and fast food workers are in the most danger. Poorer countries won't have to worry as much about the rise of the robots  for now. Other jobs in jeopardy from automation are mortgage brokers, paralegals, accountants and office administrative workers.    Jobs that require more of a human touch like doctors, teachers, bartenders and lawyers should be okay. Wait a second  the world could always use FEWER lawyers.]]></description>

      <title>Morons behind 'Traveling Butts' Instagram arrested in Thailand</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BANGKOK, THAILAND  Two American tourists were busted by Thai authorities after taking photos of their behinds in front of a sacred Buddhist temple. Joseph and Travis Dasilva posted full moon snaps at the Wat Arun temple to their Instagram account "Traveling Butts". For some reason, the account is now deleted.These two buttheads had the creativity to take pictures of their rear ends at tourist spots around the world. They had more than 14,000 people dumb enough to follow them. Unfortunately, their trip has now been tainted after being arrested Tuesday night at a Bangkok airport and face public indecency charges. Beavis and Butthead caused quite the uproar after their photos were shared widely online, which led to a police investigation. The couple thought they could slip through the crack, but ended up landing right in it instead. The two each had to pay a $150 fine and have been handed over to immigration. Officials are now deciding if Moons over My Hammies will be busted under Thailand's computer crimes act which carries a punishment of up to five years behind bars.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  Elon Musk's Boring Company has put in a bid to build an express transit link between O'Hare airport and downtown Chicago. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the city would be accepting proposals to build an express service from the airport to downtown last Wednesday, according to Newsweek.  Soon after Musk tweeted, "The Boring Company will compete to fund, build and operate a high-speed Loop connecting Chicago O'Hare Airport to downtown." The loop would be a system of tunnels underneath the city that would use electric pods rather than a vacuum tube like the hyperloop concept. The proposed route would be less than 20 miles and would need to take less than 20 minutes, according to Mayor Emanuel. The Boring Company will need  to present plans on design, finance, construction, operation and maintenance of the Loop system. No taxpayer funding will be made available for the transit project.]]></description>

      <title>Canadian model might get eye removed after botched tattoo job</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ONTARIO, CANADA  A Canadian model could be losing one of her eyes after a botched procedure left it swollen and purple.The Washington Post reports that months ago, Catt Gallinger had her sclera stained by a tattoo artist who was also her then-boyfriend. The artist was horribly inexperienced. He didn't mix the ink with saline, and used a large needle instead of a small one.The injection went too deep into the eye, delivering too much undiluted purple ink in one go, and resulting in an infection. Gallinger felt intense pain shortly afterward, and began leaking purple ink from her eye.She was prescribed antibiotic eye drops, which only helped spread the infection. Soon, a clump formed around her cornea and her eyes swelled shut.Doctors were supposed to operate on the 24-year-old so they could cut out the lump, then do an amniotic tissue graft to replace lost tissue. But when Gallinger attempted to go in for surgery without sedation in November, she suffered the worst panic attack of her life.The missed operation has put her at a higher risk of eye loss, and though sedated surgery is still a possibility, she claims she's now considering eye removal.Gallinger has been open about her ordeal, and hopes it will serve as a cautionary tale to anyone wanting to get similarly risky procedures done.The Ontario government has since added a ban on cosmetic eye tattoos to avoid more cases like Gallinger's.]]></description>

      <title>Brown bear steals rifles from hunter, goes rogue in Siberia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[IRKUTSK, RUSSIA  A wild bear turned the tables on a hunter after making off with not one, but two of the man's firearms.The 57-year-old had taken refuge at a remote cabin in Siberia's Irkutsk region, and was out getting water when a brown bear snuck into his sanctuary, according to the Siberian Times.The animal seemed taken with some hunting rifles, and latched on to them. When the man returned, he spotted the bear and quickly ran into the woods, where he hid for several hours.By the time he came back to the cabin, the bear was gone, but so were his Vepr carbine and IZH shotgun. For the next few days, the hunter searched the taiga for his guns, but failed miserably.He finally called the cops, who are now investigating the bizarre incident. So far, they've found bite marks on a plastic bucket, and scratches on some logs at the cabin.No leads on the rifle-stealing bear, though, who's probably out somewhere having fun at getting to be the hunter instead of the hunted.Meanwhile, the actual hunter is facing a fine and could forfeit his right to buy and use guns for a year. All thanks to a gun crazy bear.]]></description>

      <title>Cathay Pacific crew saw NK missile blow up from plane</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEA OF JAPAN   A crew on board a Cathay Pacific flight saw a North Korean missile blow up over the Sea of Japan last week.  Cathay Pacific CX893 was en route to Hong Kong from SF on November 29, when the crew saw the missile from their plane as it was passing over Japan, CNBC reported. The crew watched the DPRK missile blow up and fall apart during re-entry. They immediately contacted Japanese air traffic control to report the event.Cathay says it has no plans to alter its routes in the region.It's not like you really have to worry about the North Korean missiles anyways. It's the US ones you need to watch out for.   Pyongyang's launched its latest ballistic missile test last Wednesday despite international sanctions and warnings.]]></description>

      <title>UK cop uses bare hands to stop van from falling off bridge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[YORKSHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM  A UK cop is being hailed a hero after stopping a vehicle from falling over a bridge using just his bare hands and sheer determination.According to a press release from the West Yorkshire Police, the van had been driving through icy conditions on the A1(M) in Yorkshire when it skidded off the road and was left dangling precariously over a motorway bridge.When traffic officer Martin Willis arrived on the scene, he realized the driver was still trapped and hanging upside down in the van.Not willing to let the van fall over the edge, Motorway Martin grabbed hold of a wheel to keep the vehicle from swaying. He held on for 15 minutes until help arrived.The rescue operation took two hours, but ended with the 22-year-old driver being rescued, and the van being pulled to safety. The poor driver suffered serious leg injuries and was immediately taken to the hospital.Motorway Martin, meanwhile, is getting applause from all corners of the internet, for acting swiftly and saving a man's life.]]></description>

      <title>Indian man found with 263 coins and 100 nails in his stomach</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DELHI, INDIA  Doctors in India who first thought they were treating a man with abdominal pain were shocked to find coins and nails in his stomach.After complaining of abdominal pains for about a month, 32-year-old Maksud Khan was admitted to Sanjay Gandhi hospital in Delhi on November 19th.Doctors initially thought Khan was suffering from food poisoning, but then they soon discovered that the cause of his pain was far more serious. The X-ray and ultrasound result revealed multiple metal objects in Khan's abdomen ranging from coins to razor blades. Khan underwent surgery on November 24 to remove the metal objects, during which a laparoscope was used to find them all. Doctors discovered 263 coins, 1.5 kg of nails, shards of glass, stones, shaving blades, and a rusted iron shackle inside Khan's abdomen.Doctors said Khan is now in stable condition, and is expected to heal without any long term damage. However, after talking to Khan's family, doctors believed the incident is caused by Khan's depression.]]></description>

      <title>Grandmother hilariously mistakes an opossum for one of her cats</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KANSAS  An animal-loving grandmother in Kansas was found to have an opossum hanging out among her stray cats. Eric Hertlein's grandmother has a big heart, especially for our furry little friends. She's set up a nice spot in her enclosed porch with beds and food, the Dodo reported. Looks like she's also been caring for a clever little imposter for the past few months.Her grandson Eric dropped by for a visit recently. When he went to check on the cats, his kitty-sense started tingling. Right there among the felines was an opossum chilling in his own bed. When Hertlein asked his grandmother about the little dude, she said she had named him Tete and that he'd first come to her house when he was an orphaned baby looking for food. So naturally, she took the opossum in. Since then, he's be coming back for the grub and witty conversation. Eric's grandmother really thought Tete was just a cat at first, but when she finally did see it was an opossum, she said, "well, he hasn't bothered me yet, so I'm OK with him being here!"Hey, if granny says it's cool. It's cool.]]></description>

      <title>Massive bubble of hot rock rising under New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW ENGLAND  First 150 characters of description should repeat as many keywords from title as possible. Do not exceed 150 characters in first graf. This is so that the subscribe link appears above the dropdown bar.Idyllic New England could eventually become a hotbed of volcanic activity, after scientists find a huge bubble of hot rock beneath the region.Using data from earthquake measurement devices, Rutgers University researchers analyzed the speed and direction of seismic waves to visualize subsurface conditions.According to a university press release, they detected a massive upwelling of hot rock under Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, after noticing the area was noticeably hotter than neighboring regions.Though the hot mass is slowly and steadily rising, it will take millions of years before it reaches the surface and reshapes the area's geography or create a volcano.Scientists say what's happening in New England may be similar to the onset of the Yellowstone supervolcano.It emphasizes how intricate and dynamic the Earth's subsurface features are, and definitely warrants further study.]]></description>

      <title>Flu season is going to suck this year</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA  The flu has arrived early in North America, as officials worry this season's outbreak could be severe. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the percentage of patients reporting flu-like symptoms reached the 2.2 percent threshold by late November, indicating flu season had begun, USA Today reported.Experts believe the U.S. could be hit hard by the H3N2 strain, the same strain behind Australia's especially bad flu season. The flu vaccine has been shown to be 10 percent against H3N2, according to a research paper in Eurosurveillance.  Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body around two weeks after vaccination, according the the CDC. These antibodies then help the body fight against virus infections that are in the vaccine. The seasonal flu vaccine is designed to protect against influenza viruses researchers predict will be the most common during the upcoming season, the CDC reported.]]></description>

      <title>Crytocurrency mining market NiceHash hacked for $68 mil</title>
      <description><![CDATA[INTERWEBS  The crytocurrency mining marketplace NiceHash has been hacked  for around $62 million in Bitcoin. After multiple reports of users complaining about emptied NiceHash wallets and a 12-hour service outage for 'maintenance,' NiceHash was nice enough to announce that there had "been a security breach involving NiceHash website."The company didn't disclose how much was stolen, however a wallet address passed around by NiceHash users suggest as many as 4,736.42 BTC were jacked, according to CoinDesk. The NiceHash team urged users to change all their passwords. What great advice. NiceHash is currently working with authorities, but the chance people who lost money will get any of it back are slim to none. Shout out to Mt. Gox! NiceHash was started in 2014 as a marketplace for miners to rent out their hash rate to others. The market cap for BitCoin is currently worth over $225 billion. The cryptocurrency's price has been skyrocketing all year, with the price currently sitting around $14,300.]]></description>

      <title>All-electric autonomous shipping container set to sail by 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NORWAY Two Norwegian companies have teamed up to build the world's first all-electric, autonomous container ship. Norwegian company Yara and maritime technology company Kongsberg have said the vessel will be ready by late 2018, according the New Atlas. The state-of-the-art ship will transport chemicals and fertilizers from a Yara production plant to nearby towns. The plan is for the boat to first be operated by a crew in 2018, before transitioning into remote operations in 2019 and then fully autonomous by 2020. By transitioning to an all-electric shipping pathway, Yara can cut down 40,000 truck deliveries a year, which translates into reductions in nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide emissions.]]></description>

      <title>Air Force developing EMP missile that could knockout NK rockets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The U.S. Air Force is developing a new, non-lethal cruise missile which officials say could knock out North Korean missiles. The system is called the CHAMP, which stands for Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project. It's a high-powered microwave weapon that can be delivered on an air-launched cruise missile from an American bomber, according to CNN. The Champ system is designed to fly at low altitudes into enemy airspace and send out strong electromagnetic impulses in order to jam enemy control-and-command systems. Cruise missiles fired by the enemy would then splash down in the ocean. The system is still in the development phase and also has drawbacks. Although non-lethal, the missile looks similar to the nuclear-capable variant and could be mistaken as an act of war if spotted by other countries. Another obstacle for the CHAMP system is that military equipment often has redundant wiring and insulation to protect from electronic attacks. The system would need to be able to disable all those electronics in order to successfully bring missiles down out of the sky.]]></description>

      <title>The world's biggest nuclear fusion plant is now 50% complete</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FRANCE  Construction on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in southern France has reached the important halfway milestone.The ITER project consists of 35 nations working on the most complex reactor ever built, consisting of over one million different components, Newsweek reported.  Fusion energy looks to replicate the same process that powers the sun by converting hydrogen atoms into helium through a process that occurs at extreme temperatures, the Guardian reported.   The ITER hopes to use hydrogen fusion controlled by massive superconducting magnets to create heat energy that can drive turbines to produce electricity. The energy produced would have zero carbon emissions, and could potentially be done at low cost if the production scale is large enough.The reactor will have to be able to sustain temperatures 150 million degrees celsius  10 times hotter than the sun's core. The massive donut-shaped tokamak reactor will be surrounded by giant magnets that take superheated plasma away from the metal walls of the container. This requires the magnets to be cooled to -269 degrees celsius. The next milestone for the project will be to get to "first plasma" by December 2025 in order to prove the concept is viable.]]></description>

      <title>Service dog gets triggered by musical 'Cats'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  Chaos erupted at a performance of 'Cats' on broadway, after a canine audience member got triggered by one particularly feisty feline.Humans dressed as cats who sing and dance for two hours may be a hit for most people, but man's best friend apparently doesn't like it. Sorry, Andrew Lloyd Webber.Page Six reports that during a recent performance at New York's Neil Simon Theater, a service dog got away from its owner and sprinted toward the stage during the opening number.The animal was particularly unhappy with the show's flirtatious female, Bombalurina, and caused a ruckus onstage when he began chasing after her.Fortunately, an usher managed to grab the dog before it caused any real trouble, and returned it to its owner. No animals or humans were hurt in the incident, and the show went on smoothly afterward.But while the production company seemed to have laughed the encounter off, people online are genuinely pissed. Netizens think the service dog was fake, pointing out that a legit one wouldn't have acted that way.Then again, the pup could still be in training, and well- it probably failed.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA A photo of a woman who thought a man was in the wrong place when he was waiting to board his first class seat has gone viral.  According to Emmit Walker's Facebook post, he was waiting in a priority line to board first class seating when the woman approached him.Apparently, because of how Walker looked, she thought he was in the wrong place.  Walker says he pulled out his first class ticket and told her he was in the right spot and she could board after him.Walker claims she wouldn't let it go, saying, "he must be military or something, but we paid for our seats so he still should have to wait". But Walker retorted with a clap-back of epic proportions that, he says, had everybody in line clapping.]]></description>

      <title>Wall Street can't wait to short bitcoin</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  With Bitcoin up over 1,500 percent this year, Wall Street traders are itching to get in on the action. But not to buy Bit, they want to short it. The largest U.S. options exchange, CBOE Holdings, announced that it's teaming up with the Winklevoss twins' Gemini Trust Co. to create Bitcoin derivatives.CBOE will use Gemini's bitcoin data to create futures on bitcoin. Essentially, this will allow a lot more investors to bet on the movement of Bitcoin without actually having to own any of the underlying asset  Bitcoin. This is where it gets interesting. Short selling Bitcoin can be way riskier than owning the asset yourself. When you own the asset, the most you can lose is your initial investment.When you short sell an asset (Bitcoin), your losses could be infinite, limited only by how high the price goes.]]></description>

      <title>Chunky squirrel steals pricey holiday treats</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MAPLEWOOD, NEW JERSEY  An American squirrel  aka a real fat one  was caught on camera nabbing expensive chocolates and some lip balm from a Jersey family's porch.  Every year, the Boudreaux family leaves out a bundle of Christmas, sorry, holiday treats for delivery people on their doorstep.  They put out candy, snacks, tissues, hand warmers and other treats. Michele Boudreaux said they've never had any issues until this year when she noticed the basket was raided shortly after she placed it outside. She said the thief was only taking the expensive treats, including 25 Ghirardelli chocolate squares. The family put up a hidden camera to see if they could catch the perpetrator in action. They were more than a little surprised to see it was actually a super chunky squirrel.Michele then later actually ran into Chunk mid-heist and watched him clear out their chocolate yet again. Oh yeah, he also took a Carmex lip balm. The chocolate has now been placed in a jar, but Michele still leaves out some squirrel treats for Chunk too.]]></description>

      <title>Woman gets crescent-shaped eye damage from staring at eclipse</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  A woman found out first hand how a solar eclipse fries your eyes, after coming away from the Great American Eclipse with a crescent-shaped eye burn.CNN reports that on August 21, Nia Payne had gone to her boyfriend's workplace at Staten Island to see the eclipse. She peeked at the sun with her naked eye for a few seconds before borrowing glasses from a woman nearby.The 26-year-old didn't know what eclipse glasses were supposed to look like, but claims the sun still seemed bright through the pair she had on.Hours later, she noticed her vision getting blurry, and she began seeing a weird dark spot. She lost partial vision in her left eye the next day.Doctors examining her eyes were shocked to find that the damaged area in the left retina was crescent-shaped, making it look exactly like the eclipse.They suspect that the glasses she used were either defective or fake, which allowed solar radiation to penetrate through and cause retinal damage.The condition, known as solar retinopathy, is permanent and is currently untreatable. Instead, Payne has had to retrain her vision to cope, but she'll probably have a permanent crescent-shaped void in her sight for the rest of her life.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  The man responsible for the attempted suicide bombing on the Big Apple's Port Authority tunnel came to the U.S. 6 years ago via so-called "chain migration."According to the New York Times, Akayed Ullah came to the U.S. in February 2011 from Bangladesh via, what officials call, "extended family chain migration." He is the nephew of a American citizen.Ullah is said to have lived in Brooklyn as a legal permanent resident with his parents, brother and brother's wife. His father died some time ago, reported NBC New York, citing a witness talking to News 4.The 27-year-old also stayed at an apartment building on Ocean Parkway in Kensington. It's here he's believed to have assembled the explosive, reported NBC New York.From March 2012 to March 2015, Ullah held license to operate as a for-hire driver but not as a yellow taxi driver, Taxi and Limousine Commission spokesperson told ABC 7 New York. Prior to the attack, he worked as a electrician at a building site in Manhattan, reported the New York Times.Ullah told investigators his attack was inspired by Islamic State.

      <title>China is building the world's largest surveillance network</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  China is building its surveillance network, and could soon be keeping a close eye on each and every one of their 1.3 billion citizens.The Straits Times reports that roughly 176 million AI-equipped surveillance cameras are currently installed all over China, with the number set to increase to 626 million by 2020.Citizens' ID profiles, social media photos, and other personal details are being filed in a database and connected to security cameras nationwide.The advanced surveillance system uses facial recognition technology to instantly identify the name, gender, and age of any pedestrian, and the type and color of any vehicle.The same technology is being used by commercial and private institutions for financial dealings, keyless entry, and even to thwart toilet paper theft.The system can also scan faces and compare them with the police database, allowing authorities to locate and apprehend criminals at large.The network claims to boost safety and security and reduce crime, but has ironically been dubbed Skynet, after the futuristic AI from the Terminator films.That Skynet ended up trying to exterminate humanity, but maybe the Chinese version won't end up being such a nightmare.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  A Bangladeshi man set off a homemade explosive device in one of Manhattan's busiest transit hubs, in what authorities are calling a terrorist attack.According to the New York Times,the incident occurred in the underground passageway between the Port Authority Times Square subway stations.27-year-old suspect Akayed Ullah had strapped a pipe bomb to his body using velcro and zip ties, and detonated the device around 7:20 a.m.The powder-filled pipe was ignited using a Christmas light bulb, matches, and a 9-volt battery, but failed to detonate properly. One cap was blown off, but the rest of the pipe remained intact.Ullah sustained burns and lacerations to his hands and abdomen, and was taken to the hospital after being subdued by police.

      <title>Englishwoman loves chandeliers so much she's engaged to one</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEEDS, UNITED KINGDOM  A woman from Britain has a thing for lights, so much so, she got engaged to one. Amanda Liberty said she popped the question to her favoritest chandelier on Valentine's Day."You can't control who you fall in love for and things just went from there," Liberty said in a recent interview. The 33-year-old first saw the light of her life on eBay last year, and it was love at first light. Her fiancée Lumiere is a 30-inch-wide antique chandelier from Germany. Even though she's hitched to Lumiere, Liberty still snuggles up with the rest of her 25 chandeliers on the regular. Liberty first got into lights after purchasing her first chandelier. No word on if the lights get into her. Either way, the future looks bright for the happy couple.]]></description>

      <title>Did scientists just find the world's oldest living creature? Not exactly.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GREENLAND  News claiming that scientists found a Greenland shark that is 512 years old and possibly the oldest living creature is way off mark.The Science study they all link too is actually from last summer. Writing on Instagram, the study's lead author Julius Nielsen said, "Please note that we have not found any sharks to be 600 or 500 years old." Nielsen explained the shark in question was estimated to be between 272 years old and 512 years old. Though the Greenland sharks are always cool, whatever the weather. They chill in frozen waters, and aren't apex hunters like other sharks. These fish live like vultures, scavenging fish, or even the remains of reindeer and polar bears.]]></description>

      <title>Net Neutrality is dead, but now ISPs can start 'innovating'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The FCC voted on Thursday to can Obama-era net neutrality rules.Net neutrality required ISPs to offer equal access to all web content without charging people for higher-quality delivery or giving certain websites preferential status. Supporters of the repeal say it will free up internet providers to innovate. Opponents worry the internet is going to start looking a lot more like cable TV. Broadband providers could start splitting the internet up into different packages. Without net neutrality, some are concerned the internet could be split into a fast lane with big internet and media companies, and a slow lane for everyone else.]]></description>

      <title>Surgeon admits marking patient's livers during transplant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BIRMINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM  Some doctors get up to all sorts of no-good when you're old cold on the surgery table.The Telegraph reports that liver surgeon Simon Bramhall was quite the Zorro, using an argon beam to mark his initials on the livers of two patients during transplant surgery.Argon bean markings aren't harmful to the liver and normally disappear over time. One female patient's liver didn't heal properly though, and another surgeon was shocked to discover the initials during a follow-up operation.Bramhall was suspended immediately after the discovery, but ended up resigning later after going through disciplinary hearings.The surgeon has since pleaded guilty to two counts of assault by beating for marking his patients, and will be sentenced on January 12.But while most doctors were scandalized, one of SB's former patients think it's not such a big deal, since at the end of the day, it's more important to save lives.Still, that's some twisted sense of narcissism.]]></description>

Two of the ticks were found with a dinosaur feather. One was wrapped around it. Researchers say the finding the is the first direct evidence that ticks fed on feathered dinosaurs. Scientists suspect the feather belonged to an unknown type dinosaur or a ancient bird species called enantiornithine.]]></description>

      <title>Robotic blimp drone to explore Giza Pyramid hidden chamber</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PARIS  Researchers are developing a blimp-like drone that can explore a newly discovered hidden chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza. Research institutions Inria and the French National Center for Scientific Research are designing the drone to squeeze through a 1.5-inch hole, before unfolding and inflating, Digital Trends reported. "The main challenge is to insert a complete exploration robot in a hole that is as small as possible," Inria researcher Dr. Jean-Baptiste Mouret told Digital Trends. "It's important to use a hole as small as possible because we want to leave as few traces as we can. This is what we call 'minimally invasive robotics.' We chose a diameter of 1.5 inches because it is a good trade-off between the size of the hole, the kind of machines that can bore holes, and the current robotic technologies."The blimp model was chosen over conventional multi-rotor drones because it's safer the surrounding environment during exploration. The blimp drone can make contact with obstacles without damaging the monument. They are also more stable than multi-rotor drones, which is important for taking photos in low-light conditions. The camera equipped drone will be remotely operated by radio, however can also operate autonomously via small onboard sensors.]]></description>

Huh!?  Maybe Trump should just ban all words over two syllables and force everyone to speak in superlatives.]]></description>

      <title>Japanese macaques like to get it on with the deer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MINOO, JAPAN  When Japanese male macaques were spotted mounting female Sika deer back in January, some passed it off as misdirected mating.But when it became clear females were getting in on some action too, one thing's for sure: macaques really like to do it with deer. According to a study published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, adult male macaques often reject their adolescent female counterparts, so the ladies in heat end up turning to another species for satisfaction.They thrust and grind their lady bits on the backs of their stag mates, which only tolerate them because they get groomed in return.Females get pretty excited, and were seen making squeaking sounds, biting their stags, and pulling on their antlers. Some were observed intruding on a session and displacing the original partner. They're also very demanding, and throw tantrums if the deer walk away from them. Japanese macaques are known to have playful interactions with deer, and sometimes use them for transport. Scientists say the relationship may have started out this way, and that the monkeys were awakened at some point and continued to use the deer]]></description>

      <title>Eighth planet discovered orbiting around distant star Kepler-90</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  An AI algorithm sifted through data from the Kepler space telescope and uncovered an eighth planet in the Kepler-90 star system.Google AI has discovered another planet orbiting Kepler-90, making it the first star known to support as many worlds as our sun, according to NASA.Though Kepler-90 is sunlike and its system is similar to ours, all eight planets' orbits are closer to their star than the earth is to the sun.The new planet, dubbed Kepler-90i, is 30% larger than Earth, and completes an orbit around its sun every 14.4 days.But with a rocky landscape and a surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the planet is likely not habitable.Astronomers say it's possible that more planets are lurking around Kepler-90. They are planning to use the Google AI to analyze more data to hopefully uncover more exoplanets both in Kepler-90 system and beyond.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Twitter began deleting and suspending users under new guidelines laid out by the site this week. Certain groups and users from all sides of the supremacy rainbow were kicked off the social network platform.By closing these accounts, isn't America's Weibo just drawing more attention to these people and their screwball ideologies?Elsewhere, Gab.Ai., a self-described pro-free speech platform like Twitter, is reportedly gulping up ex-Twitterers and new users from the left, right and center.]]></description>

      <title>Israeli bus company to invest millions in electric road tech</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TEL AVIV, ISRAEL  Israel transit service Dan Bus Company will invest $2.2 million in technology that turns regular roads into electric power sources.Electric buses in Tel Aviv currently need to be charged via cable at departure stations, but this could soon be unnecessary, reports Globes.ElectRoad has developed technology that powers vehicles from the road while driving, using conduction coils to wirelessly charge them through magnetic induction.With this innovation, there is no need for batteries or cable charging. It also boasts zero emissions, high efficiency, and low cost.The startup will be focusing on public transportation, and will begin with laying charger coils underneath designated lanes to power the buses traversing the road daily. Eventually, ElectRoad says it may even be possible to share energy between vehicles.]]></description>

      <title>Facebook to demote posts hunting for Likes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  Facebook said on Monday it's going to start demoting posts that are just fishing for likes. As Facebook has grown in size, so has the annoyingness of their News Feeds. Users are increasingly getting bombarded with irritating posts that tell people to like, share or comment.This method is mostly used by brands and companies looking to expand their footprint. The social media giant has tweaked its algorithms to detect posts that are merely "engagement bait" and says it will show them less in the News Feed. Facebook said it will have stricter demotions for repeat offenders. The changes will be put in place over the next few weeks to give publishers some time to come up with other ways to game the system. The question we are really wondering though is, who still really uses Facebook?]]></description>

According to Vets4Pets.com, many cases of Alabama Rot have been reported across the British Isles over the last several years.

      <description><![CDATA[HOLLYWOOD  The Rotten Tomatoes audience score for the Star Wars: The Last Jedi could be fake news, if claims by a Facebook user are shown to be true.Sitting currently at around 56%, the fan claims to have hacked it with an army of fake bot accounts and the claim may not be without merit. Bleeding Cool news found Last Jedi reviews in the audience reviews section of of the Shape of Water's RT page. This could easily have been a few misprogrammed bot reviewing the wrong film.We took a closer look at some of these user profiles.On the user ID pages of most of these negative reviewers, we were presented with Page Not Found.  Evidently, these could be the bots we're looking for. Bleeding Cool News also reports that the rate of audience reviews for The Last Jedi has been incredibly fast.Thor Ragnarok has 80,000 audience ratings and it's been out for over 6 weeks. Justice League has over 116,000 user ratings in a month. The Last Jedi meanwhile got over 100k user ratings in just a few days.]]></description>

      <title>3 dead in catastrophic Amtrak train derailment in Washington</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DUPONT, WASHINGTON  Several are dead and many more injured after a train on a new Amtrak service route derailed in Washington.The New York Times reports that on Monday morning, Amtrak Train No. 501 was on its inaugural run from Seattle to Portland with 77 passengers and seven crew members onboard.While approaching a curved overpass around 7:33 a.m., the lead engine ran off the track and sent passenger coaches tumbling onto Interstate-5 below.Thirteen of the 14 cars were derailed  some crashed into several vehicles on the road, while one was left dangling over the highway. According to the Washington State Patrol, least three are confirmed dead and over 100 are injured.Passengers say they felt a wobble before suddenly being catapulted forward. Some had to kick out the windows to escape, since the emergency doors didn't work properly.It has yet to be determined if the crash was due to speed, but the train was reportedly not using positive train control technology, which automatically slows trains exceeding speed limits.Washington Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency following the deadly derailment, while Amtrak temporarily suspended service south of Seattle.]]></description>

      <title>Your smartphone may be giving you brain cancer &#x2014; or not</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA  The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) released a set of new guidelines last week dealing with cell phones and radiation risk. The department issued a guidance on how to reduce exposure to radio-frequency energy released by cell phones, despite hard evidence that exposure poses any health risks, Ars Technica reported. Some studies have suggested long-term use of smartphones could be linked to brain or salivary gland cancer, low sperm count and headaches, according to the CDPH, KQED reported. The guidelines suggest to avoid holding your phone to your head when talking on it. Send texts instead of talking. Avoid carrying your phone in your pocket, bra or belt holster. Carry it in a bag or a backpack. They also suggested to avoid using your phone with its sending high levels of radio-frequency energy, such as when you're driving, streaming content or when your signal is weak. Try not to keep your phone by your head while you're sleeping.]]></description>

They doled out the bribes, mostly to government official to unblock markets and make the climb to the top easier.To top it off, the company went to great lengths not to get caught. They used burner phones, vanishing messages, and secret servers so nothing would be recorded.But you know, life finds a way.]]></description>

      <title>China is now flying douchey tourists to Antarctica</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HONG KONG, CHINA  China claims it has flown its first commercial flight to Antarctica carrying 22 tourists. The trip consisted of a 15-hour flight from Hong Kong to South Africa, refueling in Cape Town and then another 5.5 hours to Antarctica. After reaching Antarctica, it was another five to six hours to the South Pole, where the plane landed on a 1.5-mile long runway carved into the ice, the BBC reported. The Chinese tour operator claims Chinese tourists no longer have to book through foreign agencies.  Although the trip from Cape Town onwards is actually organized and run by tour operator White Desert. White Desert regularly flies trips to the pole. So in reality, the Chinese are running the tours in cooperation with other foreign agencies.  Chinese tourists now make up the second largest group of tourists to the eighth continent, second only to U.S. tourists. The number of Chinese tourists in Antarctica has grown from 100 in 2008 to 3,944 in 2016.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[EARTH  The winter solstice arrives on Thursday, making it the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The Earth's axis has a 23.5-degree tilt, which is responsible for the seasons. As Earth makes its way around the sun each year, the Northern Hemisphere spends half of the year tilted slightly towards the sun during summer, and half the year tilted slightly  away during winter, the New York Times reported.  The winter solstice will occur at 11:28 a.m., the moment the North Pole is tilted farthest from the sun and the South Pole is tilted closest to it, according to the Baltimore Sun. Although it's the shortest day of the year in the north, the length of daylight varies by longitude and latitude.]]></description>

      <title>Baby born after being frozen as an embryo for 24 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE  The longest known frozen human embryo to result in a successful birth was born last month in Tennessee.Emma Wren Gibson was born on November 25 from an embryo that was cryogenically frozen 24 years ago, CNN reported. Emma's parents, Tina and Benjamin Gibson, chose embryo adoption after realizing they were unable to have children.  The Gibsons selected Emma after viewing around 300 donor profiles listing basic genetic information about the genetic parents. They were surprised to find out the age of the embryo when it thawed on March 13 at the National Embryo Donation Center. The embryo that led to Emma was created for in vitro fertilization by an anonymous couple and placed in cryogenic storage on October 14, 1992. The previous record was set in 2011 when a New York woman gave birth to a boy born from an embryo created 20 years earlier, the Washington Post reported.]]></description>

      <title>Facebook to stop flagging fake news because it doesn't work</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  Americans who get their fake news from Facebook will no longer have to see red flags next to their favorite stories. Yay!!! In December 2016, Facebook started showing a "disputed" warning next to stories deemed fake by third-party fact checking websites. However, research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, actually just entrenches deeply held beliefs.    Facebook's new master plan is to now show "related articles" next to the fake stories. Because people with entrenched beliefs always like to read other views. But is Facebook really to blame for all this fake news nonsense? Maybe the U.S. should stop producing so many gullible idiots.]]></description>

      <title>What is toxic shock syndrome?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  In 2012, model Lauren Wasser lost part of her right leg to a rare but potentially life-threatening condition which she claims came courtesy of her tampon.Toxic shock syndrome is typically associated with menstruating women, and is caused by toxins from the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, reports the Washington Post.TSS is linked with tampon use, since the synthetic fibers and high absorbency provide the ideal breeding ground for the bacteria.According to Mayo Clinic, symptoms include gastrointestinal distress, a sudden high-fever, low blood pressure, a sunburn-like rash, and redness of the eyes, mouth, and throat.Toxic shock progress rapidly, and can lead to kidney failure. Though fatal, it is treatable with antibiotics and fluids if diagnosed early. Another variety of the syndrome is caused by group A streptococcus bacteria, with those having cuts or burns, or having had recent surgery especially at risk.Toxic shock syndrome is rare enough that there's little information on how to prevent the onset of the disease.]]></description>

      <title>Woman charged $350 for leaving honest hotel review</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NASHVILLE, INDIANA  A guest at an Indiana “hotel” claims she was charged $350 and threatened by a lawyer after writing an honest and negative review.Luckily, the questionable business practices at the Abbey Inn & Suites in Brown County caught the eye of the Indiana Attorney General’s Office, which filed a lawsuit on Dec. 15 alleging the inn violated the Indiana Deceptive Consumer Sales Act, CBS News reported. Katrina Arthur and her hubby stayed at the inn in March 2016 and were treated to a nightmare from start to finish. The room was in shambles, but luckily they had hairs and dirt in the sheets. The sweet aroma of sewage permeated the air, the water pressure was non-existent and the AC was busted. The staff were also nowhere to be found. After their stay, Katrina got an email from the inn asking for her to write an online review, which she did and blasted the establishment. For her troubles? The inn charged her $350 bucks. Between Sept. 2015 and Nov. 2016, the Abbey Inn actually had a policy in place that let them charge people for writing bad reviews. Naturally, it was almost impossible to find little piece of info.  Hopefully Arthur will get her $350 back. The moral of the story, when you see that an inn’s two biggest selling points are hot tubs and a wedding chapel (in that order), stay someplace else.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BOYNTON BEACH, FLORIDA  'Cash me outside' girl Danielle Bregoli is dishing out Christmas miracles this year, and no one is happier than mom.TMZ reports that the 14-year-old presented her mother with a $65,000 check to pay off the mortgage, in what is arguably the best Christmas present ever: debt relief.Bregoli posted a video on Instagram of her handing over the gift, and mom responding with teary-eyed disbelief.It's a touching display, especially since the relationship between the Bregoli ladies was once fraught with stealing, aggression, and a bunch of other drama.The younger Bregoli became an overnight viral sensation in 2016, when she went on the Dr. Phil show and uttered her now-famous catchphrase.The teen was savvy enough to capitalize on her fame, selling merchandise and charging for TV and event appearances. She's currently pursuing a music career, and now goes by the rap name Bhad Bhabie.Though judging by her Christmas surprise, we'd say Bhabie really ain't so Bhad.]]></description>

      <title>Clerk scares off knife-wielding robber by pulling a gun</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEWPORT, MICHIGAN  With all the guns floating around the U.S., this Einstein from Newport, Michigan decided to try and rob a gas station armed only with a knife. Video released by Michigan State Police shows the smooth criminal entering the BP at 10:40 p.m. The guy pulls his knife and demands cash. The clerk reaches behind the counter like he's going to take out money, but instead pulls out a piece and points it right at knife man. The robber does a quick reassessment of the situation and chooses to high tail it out of the store. Police say the suspect is a white male with brown hair between 5'5" - 5'7" and drives a light-colored grey or tan, older model mid-sized car. Luckily, few people fit that description so this should be pretty open and shut for the police.]]></description>

      <title>Wild truffle found growing on Paris rooftop</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PARIS  Wild truffle was found growing on a Paris rooftop, making it a first for the city.  The foodie's fungus was discovered chillin at the base of a hornbeam tree in a hotel rooftop garden close to the Eiffel Tower, the BBC reported. Food connoisseurs are excited because truffles are usually found farther south in warmer climates, where they are dug up by specially-trained dogs or pigs.The type of truffle found in Paris isn't the most prized, but it still goes great with scallops, sausage or potatoes.  The 25-gram winter truffle was taken to the National Museum of Natural History. Paris has been pushing for more urban gardening, and has a goal of developing about 100 acres of office and building rooftops over the next two years. Well, now that you can grow truffles up there, they'll probably be a lot more volunteers.]]></description>

      <title>Airport facial recognition scans draw scrutiny for violating privacy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  A report has found that an airport biometric program is improperly gathering data on Americans, and violating their privacy.According to a report from the Georgetown Law Center for Privacy and Technology, the Department of Homeland Security has installed facial scanners in nine international airports across the U.S., as part of their biometric exit program.The program is part of efforts to nab travelers who are overstaying their visas, or using fraudulent documents. Passengers' faces are scanned at the boarding gate, and matched to a DHS database for verification.Face scans are mandatory for foreign nationals, but U.S. citizens on international flights can opt out and have their documents manually checked.It's unclear though, if American passengers are being informed of this option.According to Homeland Security's own data, 1 in 25 travelers are erroneously rejected by the system despite using valid credentials.The technology also reportedly had high error rates, and often inaccurately identified women and African Americans.]]></description>

      <title>Male rub-on contraceptive goes into human trials</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND  Government researchers in the U.S. are getting ready to test a topical contraceptive gel designed to lower sperm production.The clinical trial will begin in April and run for around four years, and will be the largest study conducted to test a hormonal form of male birth control, MIT Technology Review reported. Researchers at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development are working on a hormonal gel that reduces sperm count when applied to the skin. The gel contains two synthetic hormones  nestorone and testosterone. The nestorone blocks the testes from making enough testosterone to produce normal levels of sperm. The synthetic testosterone is needed to prevent hormonal imbalance caused by the nestorone.More than 400 couples in the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Sweden, Chile and Kenya will participate in the clinical trial. Couples will use the treatment for over four months while their sperm levels are checked.  Men in the study will take home a bottle of the gel and rub around half a teaspoon of it on their upper arms or shoulders every day. The gel takes about a minute to dry. According to researchers, the gel can lower sperm count for about 72 hours.]]></description>

      <title>Apple admits to intentionally slowing down older iPhones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Data from a benchmarking firm confirmed long-held suspicions that Apple has been intentionally slowing down older iPhones.The tech giant has confirmed as much, but claims it's not a conspiracy theory to get you to buy their newer models, and is instead a battery issue.CNET reports that lithium-ion batteries degrade over time, and can only hold an 80% charge after 500 charge cycles. This, along with cold climate or a low charge, affects performance.Older iPhone models tend to draw more power than their batteries can handle, which can cause the device to suddenly and unexpectedly shut down. To prevent this, Apple's new iOS update throttles CPU speeds on older models, in order to limit how much power is drawn from the battery.A number of users have worked around the issue by replacing their batteries, which reportedly restored the phones to their normal speed.Critics have slammed Apple for its lack of transparency, pointing out that users should have been informed of the issue and possible solutions. Most mistakenly believed they needed to upgrade to newer models, when really, a battery replacement would have sufficed.]]></description>

      <title>Great American Eclipse created bow waves in our atmosphere</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  The total solar eclipse in August 2017 left bow waves in the Earth's upper atmosphere, like a boat sailing through water. On August 21, researchers from MIT's Haystack Observatory and the University of Tromsø in Norway were able to find "the first unambiguous evidence" of atmospheric bow-waves.  The team published their findings in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The bow-wave theory says that a total solar eclipse will create high-pressure pockets under the moon's shadow that then slice through low-pressure air as the path of totality moves across the planet. These air pockets then generate small bow waves in the atmosphere.During the August eclipse, the scientists collected data from around 2,000 satellite sensors placed across North America. They detected tiny bow waves in Earth's ionosphere, the section of the atmosphere that begins 37 miles above the surface. The researchers said their study, "reveals complex interconnections between the Sun, Moon and Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere."]]></description>

      <title>Woman claims United gave away her first class seat to Texas rep</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  United Airlines is again embroiled in a controversy after a passenger said she was booted from her seat to make room for a Texas lawmaker.The Houston Chronicle reports that on December 18, Jean-Marie Simon was in Houston, waiting to board the last leg of her round trip D.C. to Washington flight.Simon bought first class tickets and was supposed to be in seat 1A, but the gate agent who scanned her ticket found that it wasn't in the system, and asked if she cancelled her flight.Her seat had apparently been taken, and she was given a $500 voucher and reseated in Economy Plus.Simon soon found out that her seat had ultimately been given to U.S. Rep Sheila Jackson Lee, a Houston democrat. Another congressman on the flight also told her Jackson Lee made a habit of bumping passengers off flights, and it was the third time he'd personally seen her do it.Simon also says a flight attendant approached her after she snapped a photo of Jackson Lee, and threatened to have her removed if she caused problems.Responding to the incident, Jackson Lee claimed she never asked for special treatment, before then saying Simon may have easily targeted her as an African-American woman.Simon flatly denies the racism accusation. She has since written United CEO of her ordeal, but only received an apology from a resolution manager.The 63-year-old private school teacher has yet to receive a formal apology from the company.]]></description>

ANA Flight 175 was set to fly from LAX to Tokyo, but four hours into the journey, the crew discovered an extra passenger on board. Two brothers with similar names were booked on separate flights on two separate airlines to Tokyo, but somehow both got on ANA Flight 175.  Model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen happened to be on the flight with her hubby with the pipes, John Legend, and gave live tweet updates as the eight hour u-turn unfolded, according to CNN. Yeah, it must have been horrible sitting in first class for eight hours and then having the media write stories about your ordeal - first world problems.  What Teigen should have done is made John give the 226 passengers a little in-flight concert. Now that would have been an epic flight to nowhere.]]></description>

      <title>FBI investigating bros who got on wrong LAX-Tokyo flight, but how on Earth did it happen?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[L.A.  The FBI may charge two brothers who allegedly boarded an L.A. to Tokyo flight with the same boarding pass, reports ABC News. The flight was forced to turn back four hours into its journey when airline staff discovered an "unauthorized person."  The mishap happened after a pair of Tokyo-bound brothers, booked on different flights, were somehow allowed onto the same ANA flight on December 26.According to ABC News, the feds allege that one used a duplicate boarding pass to do so. Law enforcement told CNN that the brothers had similar names. While this case is suspect, there have been genuine flight mix-ups in the past.Aviation expert Buck Rodger told CNN that there are three checks for passengers. These are boarding gate checks, in-flight destination announcements and assigned seating. Rodgers said that a combination of faults from these can create a flight mix-up.Federal investigators are looking into the case but have not charged anyone, reported the BBC.]]></description>

It causes flu-like symptoms, and can kill 80% of those exposed within 24 hours, unless antibiotics are administered.South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bought 1,000 doses of anthrax vaccine for agents or civilians.
