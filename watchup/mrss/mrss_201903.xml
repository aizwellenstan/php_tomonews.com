      <title>China unveils ambitious Greater Bay Area plan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  China's State Council has revealed details of a plan to promote economic cooperation among several major cities in the Pearl River Delta.The Greater Bay Area plan will integrate and transform Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in China's Guangdong province into 'a global center of technology, innovation, and economic vibrancy.According to HSBC research, the region is currently home to 70 million people, and produces 37% of the country's exports and 12% of its GDP. With closer integration of the cities, China hopes this output will increase.The South China Morning Post reports that the plan is for cities to serve as key hubs for different sectors. Hong Kong will be the international finance, transport, and trade center, while Macau will serve as a hub for tourism and platform for trade with Portuguese-speaking countries.Other core cities include Guangzhou as the provincial capital and administrative hub, Shenzhen as the center for technology and innovation, and Dongguan as a high-tech manufacturing hub.Infrastructure is being developed to increase connectivity between cities. This includes the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, which is the world's longest sea crossing bridge, and the high speed rail link from Hong Kong to the Mainland.According to the BBC, the Greater Bay Area is being set up to rival Silicon Valley, and major metropolitan areas like Tokyo, San Francisco, and New York. But while the Greater Bay Area's GDP already surpasses that of San Francisco, it lags behind New York and Tokyo.The region could face challenges in economic integration, since Hong Kong and Macau have their own monetary, legal, and political systems separate from the Mainland. Talent distribution across the 11 cities may also be an issue, since most will be drawn to the bigger cities like Hong Kong and Guangzhou.The Hong Kong Free Press reports that the plan has been met with skepticism by the island's pro-democracy lawmakers, who allege that the development of Mainland cities will come at the expense of Hong Kong.A Bloomberg opinion piece notes that 'Hong Kong seems to be the likely loser', adding that the plan is vague on how integration will affect Hong Kong and Macau's special status.]]></description>

      <title>Chunky rat rescued from manhole in Germany</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BENSHEIM, GERMANY  A not so slim rat will live to eat another day after getting rescued by a whole bunch load of rescue workers from getting stuck in a manhole cover.According to the BBC, animal rescuer Michael Sehr told local media, "she had a lot of winter flab and was stuck fast at her hip  there was no going forward or back."Sehr is from the local professional animal rescue in Rhein Neckar[b] and was first on the scene, but Fatatouille was too much for him to handle, so he called in the big guns. According to the local fire department, a whole mess of volunteer firefighters responded to the Sunday afternoon call. The manhole cover was lifted up and propped up on wedges while Sehr went in and got Slim Shady free. The team then did a quick photo shoot with Fats before releasing her back into the sewer. The animal group posted the shots and the whole rescue video up on their Facebook page.  As for the rat, she said she's going to cut out carbs and maybe look into Atkins or Paleo, possibly some juice cleanses. But for sureno gluten.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese teen turns mom's $119 into $2,500 in just 8 days</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DEZHOU, CHINA  A teen in Dezhou in China's Shandong Province proved to be a savvy young entrepreneur after he turned a two-grand profit from a mini game arcade in just 8 short days.According to China Press, the 14-year-old got the idea after seeing similar stalls at the plaza during winter break, and thought it might be a good way to earn some dough.The kid borrowed 800 RMB, or about $119, from his mom, and used it to buy 400 glasses and about 300 ping pong balls.The game's pretty simple: each glass has money ranging from 5 to 100 yuan or about 75 cents to 14 bucks.To play, people fork over $10 for 10 ping pong balls. If they manage to land the ball in a glass, they get to keep whatever moolah is inside.Needless to say, the place was a hit. The teen earned 17,000 RMB, or $2,500, in 8 days, with enough extra to pay off two assistants. He could have earned more, too, except it was time to go back to school.And don't think he forgot his momma either. Son of the year says he's getting her a new phone.Best kid ever.]]></description>

      <title>Failed Russian Venus probe could crash back to Earth this year</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  A failed 1970s Russian Venus probe which has been trapped in Earth orbit could crash back into the planet this year. According to Space.com, the Cosmos 482 Venus probe was launched on March 31, 1972, but due to a rocket malfunction, failed to escape Earth's orbit. A large portion of the failed spacecraft still remains in orbit today as space junk, but according to experts could fall back to Earth this year.According to Don Mitchell, who studies Soviet space history talking to Space.com, when the Cosmos 482 mission failed, a heavy frame of tanks and equipment were jettisoned from the probe and burned up in Earth's atmosphere. However, the Cosmos 482 Venus entry capsule is still adrift, orbiting the Earth every 112 minutes. The lander mass is 1,091 pounds (495 kilograms) and is equipped with significant thermal protection. According to satellite watcher Thomas Dorman talking to Space.com, the failed probe could fall back to Earth this year or mid next year. According to Space.com, previous estimates had the probe falling between 2023 and 2025.]]></description>

      <title>How the Democratic party will stage its primary debates</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The Democratic National Committee has announced that it will limit the number of presidential debate participants to 20 candidates. The debates will be held in June and July on two separate consecutive nights depending on the number of candidates who qualify. The Associated Press reports that candidates will qualify for the debate if they earn at least 1 percent support in three separate national or early primary state polls conducted from January 1 to two weeks before the debate.They can also qualify if they receive campaign donations from 65,000 people across 20 different states, with a minimum of 200 unique donors per state. Candidates will be assigned randomly to the two stages regardless of their polling percentages.Efforts for a fairer and less poll-driven selection process for the nominees comes after voters in the 2016 elections felt the DNC was biased against the then outsider Senator Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton won the primary but went on to lose to Republican candidate Donald Trump.These claims stemmed mainly from allegations by former DNC chair Donna Brazile. In her book Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House, Brazile accuses Clinton of rigging the primary elections in her favor by signing a joint fundraising agreement with the DNC and the Hillary Victory Fund.The exact dates and locations for the debates are yet to be confirmed. The DNC announced that NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo will broadcast the June debates on back-to-back nights, and CNN will broadcast the July debate on back-to-back nights.

      <title>Iceland allows more than 2,000 whales to be killed</title>
      <description><![CDATA[REYKJAVIK, ICELAND   Iceland's government has announced it will be allowing whaling companies to kill more than 2,000 whales within the next five years, reports the Associated Press.According to the Animal Welfare Institute Iceland has had a bumpy relationship with the International Whaling Commission after it imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling back in 1986.Iceland withdrew from the IWC but came back in 2002 and continued to hunt whales under a special permit that allowed them to kill protected species under the guise that it was being done for scientific purposes.Now, the Icelandic government is allowing whale hunters to kill over 2,000 whales per year over the next five years.The Associated Press reports that the Icelandic government has announced that whaling will be permitted for at least another five years.Iceland's Fisheries and Agriculture Minister Kristjan Thor Juliusson announced that whalers would be allowed to harpoon 209 fin whales and 217 minke whales every year until 2023.The World Wildlife Fund lists fin whales as an endangered species.Iceland has four harpoon-equipped vessels. According to the Directorate of Fisheries, in 2018, they hunted 5 minke whales and 145 fin whales.According to the University of Iceland, whaling is profitable for the country, bringing in roughly $11.8 million per year between 2009 and 2017.However, the AP reports that politicians are increasingly opposing whaling practices as they believe it damages the country's image and affects tourism which is a growing industry in the country. Last December, Japan announced it would be withdrawing from the IWC in order to resume commercial whaling for the first time in 30 years.]]></description>

      <title>Man coughing blood for 2 months finds massive throat leech</title>
      <description><![CDATA[YIBIN, CHINA  A 60-year-old Chinese man in Yibin had an itchy throat and bloody cough for about two months, turns out it was only a leech. According to Red Star News, the man named Li had been trying to find a cure but kept getting misdiagnosed. He finally figured out why things have been sucking for him so much after he saw a specialist at a hospital in Xingwen County. Dr. Zhang Dadong performed an endoscopy on Li and found a big old 10 cm long leech chilling in his windpipe. The doctor called in some help and a team of them helped sedate and finally pull out the leech using some forceps. Looks like Li, who is from countryside town of Daba, ingested the eggs when he drank some untreated water. The larva then hatched in his throat and had a buffet blood feast for about two months, growing to quite an impressive size. The doctor advised people from the area to boil their water first before drinking it.]]></description>

      <title>SpaceX Dragon capsule successfully docks with ISS</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA  An unmanned SpaceX Dragon capsule has successfully docked with the International Space Station as part of its demonstration mission, according to the BBC.  According to Reuters, the 16-foot-tall (4.9 meter) Crew Dragon capsule was launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Kennedy space Center at 2:49 a.m. on Saturday and deployed into orbit 11 minutes later. According to the BBC, the Dragon test vehicle autonomously attached itself to the international docking adapter. The BBC reports the Crew Dragon approached the ISS using lasers and software to guide itself in, while astronauts aboard the space station monitored the docking.  According to BBC, the capsule's "soft capture" contact with the space station occurred at 10:51 GMT, with a full and secure docking confirmed around 10 minutes later. According to Reuters, the capsule was carrying 400 pounds of supplies and test equipment, and a test dummy named "Ripley."Ripley is equipped with sensors around the head, neck and spine to monitor how a flight would feel for a human. The Crew Dragon is scheduled to stay at the ISS for five days, while the three crew members of the space station perform tests on the capsule to see how it is holding up in space. On Friday morning, after being checked out and loaded with cargo, the capsule will undock from the ISS and then plunge back toward Earth. Parachutes will deploy during the capsule's decent, where it should plunge into the Atlantic Ocean near Florida for retrieval.]]></description>

      <title>Canada monitoring negative behavior of 'at risk' people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ONTARIO, CANADA  Canadian authorities are using databases to track 'at risk' individuals, according to a Motherboard investigation.Canadian authorities are using a shared database called 'The Risk-driven Tracking Database' or RTD to track so-called 'at risk' individuals. The RTD is part of a larger Canadian pre-crime policing network called 'The Hub' that partners law enforcement, school staff, social workers, healthcare workers, and local governments.Police and civilian agencies can access this database to gather information of individuals believed to be at risk which includes people living in dangerous neighborhoods and those that could become criminals or victims, allowing them to intervene in case of emergencies.Individuals are registered into the RTD if local authorities report abnormal behavior to The Hub. This data can then be used to request intervention from other law enforcement agencies or institutions.Authorities can input an individual's sex, location and age group including other 'risk factors' such as mental health, criminal involvement, negative behavior and physical health status.Currently, there are only two RTDs, one in Ontario and the other in Saskatchewan. However, according to the Correctional Service of Canada, there are roughly 100 active Hubs in the country as of 2016.]]></description>

      <title>Mysterious Planet Nine could be discovered in a decade</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PASADENA, CALIFORNIA  New research suggests we might be able to spot the mysterious Planet Nine sooner than we thought. In 2016 scientists from California Institue of Technology published research in the Astronomical Journal that found new evidence of the existence of Planet Nine. The scientists used mathematical models and computer simulations to map out the hypothetical planet's orbit after finding abnormal alignments of six objects in the Kuiper Belt suggesting that a larger object's gravity was pulling them.The Kuiper Belt is a ring of icy objects located beyond the orbit of Neptune. Within it are several thousand celestial bodies, several of which have their own moons.Planet Nine remains unseen. However, a paper published last month by the same Caltech team in the journal Physics Reports suggests that it could be detected within a decade.Results also showed that its mass is probably five to 10 times the mass of Earth.They estimate Planet Nine to be about 400 astronomical units away from the sun, which is the equivalent of 60 billion kilometers or 37 billion miles. These new estimates suggest that the planet is closer and potentially brighter than previously thought, making it easier to detect in the coming years.In a second paper published in the Astronomical Journal, the same group of researchers calculated the percentage of potential bias of their observations. Results showed the probability was just one in 500.In a Caltech press release, Konstantin Batygin, one of the lead researchers of both papers said, quote, 'The prospect of one day seeing real images of Planet Nine is absolutely electrifying. Although finding Planet Nine astronomically is a great challenge, I'm very optimistic that we will image it within the next decade.']]></description>

      <title>Nanoparticle injections let mice see infrared light, study finds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANHUI, CHINA / WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS  Researchers from China and the U.S. used nanoparticles to enhance the vision of mice, allowing them to see in infrared, according to a new study published in the journal Cell.A team of researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China and the University of Massachusetts Medical School injected nanoparticles into the eyes of mice that gave them the ability to see infrared light without compromising their normal vision.Humans and mice are not able to see infrared light naturally. Both species can only see to light in the visible spectrum.According to the study, the pupils of the mice that received the nanoparticles injection were constricted. This meant their eyes were able to detect infrared light even during the day. Mice that only received a buffer solution did not have constricted pupils.Jin Bao, one of the researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China, explained in the study that nanoparticles were able to anchor to the photoreceptor cells in the eyes, also known as the rods and the cones, and convert the infrared light to make it appear as a green color.The nanoparticles do this by capturing the longer infrared wavelengths and sending out shorter wavelengths in the visible spectrum. This is then absorbed by a rod or a cone, which then sends sends a signal to the brain, tricking the brain into believing that visible light has hit the retina.This technology could be used in security and military operations in the future, according to the study.Senior author Tian Xue said in the study this technology is exciting because it could "eventually enable human beings to see beyond our natural capability."]]></description>

      <title>US deploys THAAD missile system in Israel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JERUSALEM  The U.S. deployed its most advanced air and missile defense system in Israel for the first time, according to U.S. and Israeli military officials on Monday, Reuters reports. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, deployment was intended to test the U.S. military's ability to rapidly deploy such weapons around the world, according to a spokeswoman for U.S. European Command. According to Reuters, Lockheed Martin builds and integrates the THAAD system, which is designed to shoot down short- medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Raytheon builds its advanced radar. According to Army Technology, the THAAD system is designed to protect against incoming ballistic missiles at ranges of 200 kms and altitudes of up to 150 kms. According to Army Technology, the THAAD battery typically operates nine launch vehicles each carrying eight missiles, with two tactical operations centers and a ground-based radar. THAAD intercepts incoming ballistic missiles in their final phase of flight, according to Reuters. Radar first detects incoming threats, identifies the target and engages. An interceptor missile is fired from the launcher, and then uses kinetic energy to destroy the incoming missile.  According to Reuters, the deployment comes amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran over Israel's bombing campaign in Syria and comments in which Iran's foreign minister said he could not rule out the possibility of military conflict between the two countries.]]></description>

      <title>'Keto Crotch': The smelly side effect of the popular diet?</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA  The Keto diet is currently in the news for the wrong reasons. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low carb plan where healthy fats make up 80 percent of a person's daily calories, and protein 20 percent.This involves eating roughly 50 grams of carbohydrates a day, equivalent to a bagel or a cup of white rice. In comparison, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends 225 to 325 grams of carbs a day.When carbs are taken out of the diet, the body burns up glucose reserves and then breaks down stored fat into fatty acids.The New York Post cites social media users on Reddit threads and Twitters boards as saying the diet is making women smelling a bit strange "down there."Women are complaining about "keto crotch," a strong odor coming from their private parts once they've taken on the keto diet."Liza De Fazio, a registered dietitian nutritionist, told Insider that the keto diet could change the pH levels of the body, which may result in a different odor than usual.However, California-based obstetrician and gynecologist Jen Gunter refuted the dietician by tweeting: "Food does not change vaginal odor ... if your sweat or breath smells of ketones then everywhere else will too."]]></description>

      <title>Deep sleep important for brain to clear out toxic proteins: Study</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ROCHESTER, NEW YORK  The depth of one's sleep can affect the brain's ability to adequately remove waste and toxic proteins, according to a new study published in the journal Science Advances.An increase of toxic proteins such as beta amyloid and tau in the brain are often linked with Alzheimer's disease, according to a University of Rochester Medical Center news release.The researchers injected six mice with six different anesthetic regimens to replicate different stages of sleep.This was to identify if a certain phase of sleep could be associated with the glymphatic system, which the brain uses to clear waste.The scientists determined the best glymphatic system activity takes place in the stage that was most similar to a human's deep, non REM, short-wave sleep, efficiently stimulating the cleaning process of the brain.Mice that were given anesthetics which did not lead to slower brain activity had a decline in glymphatic activity, according to the study.The study reinforces the link between poor sleep and Alzheimer's disease, and the importance of deep sleep for the brain's cleaning system to work effectively.]]></description>

      <title>Self-driving cars may be more likely to hit black people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ATLANTA  If you happen to be of a darker persuasion, you might want to keep your head on a swivel next time you see an autonomous vehicle, because according to a new study, it might not see you. According to a new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology, the darker your skin, the more likely you might be to getting hit by a self-driving car, because automated vehicles may be better at detecting whiter pedestrians. According to Vox, researchers wanted to see how well self-driving cars detected people with different skin colors. They analyzed a large dataset of images that had pedestrians and divided them up into light-skinned and dark-skinned groups using the Fitzpatrick scale, a system for separating human skin tones from light to dark. The researchers found that the dark-skinned group was less accurately detected by five percentage points than the light-skinned group.  They found the difference to still be significant when they controlled for variables like time of day or the occasionally blocked view of pedestrians. The study is called "Predictive Inequity in Object Detection," and has yet to be peer reviewed. Another area researchers might want to analyze is whether detection can be affected when white people are in blackface. Better yet, can black people can increase their chances of survival by putting on whiteface?]]></description>

      <title>Man charges obese passenger $150 for encroaching on his seat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE FRIENDLY SKIES  A man hilariouslyor horrificallycharged a large and in charge passenger sitting next to him on a flight $150 for encroaching on his seat. The anonymous man wrote about his experience on a Reddit AITA forum and has since taken off. The guy was apparently flying on a five-hour cross country flight and specifically chose a row with no middle seat and picked the aisle seat. He then goes on to say, "a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats." Karma immediately kicks in, with the large passenger cruising over to the window seat next to the guy. "He sits down and is easily seeping into about ⅓ of my seat," he goes on. "I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable."So after about 60 seconds of that, the guy lets the bigger gentleman know that this isn't going to fly. The larger man tried to take up less space, but let's say he hit a bit of turbulence.After talking to a flight attendant, she says big guy could buy a second seat, but that idea crashed because the flight was full. Other ideas that didn't take off were booking another flight and sitting next to someone else that wouldn't mind. So that's when the guy said he would "put up with" the situation for $150 bones. The big fella instantly agreed and handed over the benjamins, saying he "appreciated" it.]]></description>

      <title>Teen spikes step dad's drinks with cattle tranquilizer to be funny</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LIMA, WISCONSIN  A Wisconsin teen was busted for spiking his step dad's drinks with cattle tranquilizer, and apparently did it for funsies.According to the criminal complaint, Tyler Rabenhorst-Malone is facing felony charges for placing foreign objects in edibles and second degree recklessly endangering safety.It all began in January 2018, when the 17-year-old's stepfather went to the doctor for some pretty odd symptoms- he was stumbling, slurring his speech, breathing heavily, and had a droopy face.Doctors chalked it up to one too many energy drinks, stress, and not enough snooze. But when it happened again, step figured something else was up.In April, Mom reported that a box of oxytocin mixed with rompun went missing from the barn.Step dad soon got suspicious that it was his step son was, and found two used syringes shoved in a corner of the barn that he thought the boy was using to mess with his drinks.After he gave samples to the po-po, the state lab found both the drinks and syringes tested positive for Xylazine, which is used to sedate large animals.When confronted, the teen told officers he never wanted to hurt his dad, and just did it to be funny.Not funny now that you're about to go to jail though, is it?]]></description>

      <title>Kylie Jenner named youngest self-made billionaire ever</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA  The youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner family has officially been named the world's youngest self-made billionaire by Forbes.Kylie Jenner was just a child when her sisters started filming popular reality show Keeping up with the Kardashians back in 2007.Since then, she has constantly courted controversy for things like getting lip injections at a young age and for allegedly undergoing plastic surgery.All this worked in her favor and exponentially increased her social media following. Kylie even acknowledged this in an interview with Forbes saying, "It's the power of social media, I had such a strong reach before I was able to start anything."The 21-year-old acquired the bulk of her fortune through Kylie Cosmetics, a makeup company she launched in 2015 when she was just a teenager, according to Forbes.Kylie launched the company with the infamous Kylie Lip Kits, directly through social media to her tens of millions of fans.The company has since gone on to be worth at least US$900 million, with Kylie owning 100 percent of the company.However, many have argued that the 21-year-old can't be "self-made" because her family are well-known reality TV stars, and gave her the platform to succeed and build her cosmetics company.]]></description>

      <title>London patient is second to be cleared of HIV</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A case study published in the journal Nature details the successful treatment of a patient in London, who is now in long-term HIV remission.CNN reports that a man known as the London patient has become the second person in the world to be cleared of HIV after the Berlin patient more than a decade ago.According to the New York Times, the two men achieved the milestones after undergoing bone marrow stem cell transplants intended to treat their cancer.In both instances, patients received stem cells from donors with a rare genetic mutation of the protein CCR5, making them HIV-resistant.HIV typically uses the CCR5 on the surface of immune cells to enter those cells, but is unable to latch on to the mutated version of the protein.According to the New York Times, the transplanted immune cells replaced the London patient's vulnerable cells, and destroyed the cancer without any harmful side effects.He remained on antiretroviral drugs until stopping in September 2017. The Guardian reports that blood tests have shown no signs of the virus for the past 18 months.Anton Pozniak, president of the International Aids Society, says the findings reaffirm the belief that AIDS is curable.He told the Guardian that the hope is there will eventually be a safe, cost-effective, and easy way to achieve results with gene technology or antibody techniques.]]></description>

      <title>'Broken heart' syndrome linked to the brain, new study finds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ZURICH  A new study published in the European Heart Journal says that the brain might be linked to broken heart syndrome.Also known as takotsubo syndrome, a broken heart is often caused by shock usually after a stressful or emotional event.The syndrome has similar symptoms to a heart attack such as breathlessness and chest pain, according to the study.The study goes on to suggest that an increase of stress hormones could be linked to the broken heart syndrome.The researchers looked at brain scans of 15 patients with broken heart and found decreased connectivity between the limbic system, which processes emotions, and the autonomic nervous system which controls breathing and heartbeat.Jelena Ghadri, a researcher involved with the study, was quoted by the BBC as saying "Emotions are processed in the brain so it is conceivable that the disease originates in the brain with top-down influences on the heart."According to the BBC, it could take weeks, days or even months for the heart muscle to recover from the syndrome.]]></description>

      <title>Self-powered sensors track firefighters during blazes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HAMILTON, CANADA  Researchers have created a motion-powered, fireproof sensor that can track movements of people who work in high-risk environments like firefighters, steelworkers and miners, according to a McMaster University press release.  McMasters researchers, working with partners at other colleges, have created a low-cost sensor that is about the size of a button-cell battery. According to the release, the sensors can be incorporated into the sole of a boot or under the arm of a jacket, wherever motion creates a pattern of constant contact and release to generate the energy the sensor needs to function. By harvesting electricity from movement, the sensor uses triboelectric, or friction-generated, charging for power.The sensors can track the movement and location of a person in a burning building, a mineshaft or other hazardous locations, alerting those outside if movement stops. The key material in the sensor, a new carbon aerogel nanocomposite, is fireproof and never needs charging from a power source. The sensors have been successfully tested at temperatures up to 300 degrees Celsius without any loss of function. The development teamfrom McMaster, UCLA and University of Chemistry and Technology Praguedescribes the new device in a paper published in the journal Nano Energy.]]></description>

      <title>No link found between measles vaccine and autism, study finds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COPENHAGEN, DENMARK / STANFORD, CALIFORNIA   A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine has confirmed that getting a Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccination won't cause a child to develop autism.Researchers involved in the study examined more than a half a million Danish children born between 1999 and 2010 to see if there was a link between getting vaccinated and receiving an autism diagnosis.The study found that the vaccine isn't linked to an increased risk of autism. The researchers explained that a vaccination wasn't likely to cause autism, adding that it also is not responsible for autism cases that appear after vaccination takes place.The news comes in wake of several measles outbreaks in the U.S. Many parents there refuse to have their children vaccinated against the disease because they believe vaccinations cause autism.There are six measles outbreaks across the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Symptoms include high fever, red eyes, and a rash that begins on the face.The CDC says the virus is contagious as it stays in the airspace when an infected person has coughed or sneezed. 90 percent of those not immune to the virus will likely become infected.The CDC also recommends getting the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine to prevent any new outbreaks.]]></description>

      <title>China's plans to explore Mars and build a power plant in space</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING   China plans to build the first solar power plant in space and embark on a mission to Mars.China intends to build a solar power station that would orbit earth at a distance of 36,000 kilometers, according to reports from China's Science and Technology Daily.Components of the solar power plant would be sent to space where they would then be assembled, according to CNN.Pang Zhihao, a researcher from the China Academy of Space Technology, told the newspaper the solar station would be able to draw energy from the sun without any interference from Earth's atmosphere.A receiving station will be built in the northern Chinese city of Xian. The electricity could hypothetically be beamed to Earth via microwaves or lasers, although more research needs to be done on the effects these would have on humans and animals.In addition to the orbital power plant, China also has plans to send a rover to Mars.The country has opened its first Mars simulation base in China's Qinghai Province. The area resembles the Martian surface with its dry and arid climate, according to Global Times.China's Mars mission is being called the Mars Global Remote Sensing Orbiter and Small Rover, or HX-1.The lander will touch down on the northern hemisphere of Mars, according to the State Council of the People's Republic of China's website.The lander will contain a rover with six wheels and four solar panels and will be able to explore Mars by itself.]]></description>

      <title>Satellite images show North Korea rebuilding nuclear missile site</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NORTH KOREA  Beyond Parallel and 38 North, websites that monitor North Korea, have noticed activity at the country's Tongchang-ri[g][h][i] satellite launch facility.Also known as the Sohae[j][k] launch facility, Beyond Parallel released images of the site being partly constructed. The photos are said to show partially built structures, including a vertical engine test stand and rail-mounted rocket transfer.The vertical engine test stand was partly dismantled in August 2018, according to Beyond Parallel. The outlet referred to the ongoing activity at the missile base as "deliberate and purposeful."However, 38 North founder Joel Wit, said on Twitter that movement at the missile testing site provides "no evidence" that North Korea is preparing to launch another ICBM.The news follows the recent Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam where both sides didn't come to an accord on denuclearization, CNN reports. CNN quotes Trump as saying he would be "very disappointed" if Kim Jong Un has restarted North Korea's missile program.]]></description>

      <title>Genetically tweaked microbe can make plastic from plants</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MADISON, WISCONSIN  A genetically engineered microbe is the key to producing biodegradable plastics from a common plant waste material.According to research from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, N. aromaticivorans is a type of soil bacteria that can digest lignin from plant cells and turn them into smaller hydrocarbons.Lignin is a polymer found in the cell walls of woody plants, which although abundant, is difficult to break down. It has such little value that paper mills that have been stripping lignin from wood for centuries merely dispose of it in boilers.During digestion, the bacteria turns lignin into 2-pyrone-4, 6-dicarboxylic acid, or PDC. By removing three genes from the microbe, University of Wisconsin-Madison scientists were able to make PDC the end point for the digestion process.UWM researcher Miguel Perez says bioengineers in Japan used PDC to make a variety of materials for consumer products, and found it performs the same or better than petroleum-based additives in PET polymers, like plastic bottles or synthetic fibers.As a plastic alternative, PDC would naturally break down in the environment, but wouldn't leach compounds as it degrades.Researchers have so far managed to turn 59 percent of lignin's compounds into PDC, but suggest greater efficiency might be achieved with further gene-tweaking.The study is published in the journal Green Chemistry.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[PARIS  Life on a photogenic Parisian street has turned nightmarish for its residents, who now have to deal with all the crazy things people do "for the 'gram."According to radio station France Info, Rue Cremieux in Paris' 12th arrondissement is a small cobblestone street lined with pastel-colored houses that's become a huge hit on Instagram.So while there are no cars on the picturesque street, there are hordes of tourists who come day in and day out, all to strike a pose...or fifty.Over 30,000 photos on Instagram are hashtagged Rue Cremieux, making it one of the most popular photo spots in Europe.For people who actually live there though, it sucks. Residents told the radio station that while weekdays are relatively quiet, weekends bring rappers, screaming bachelorette parties, and other rowdy visitors.One local documented the shenanigans on the Instagram account Club Cremieux, which shows flash mobs, photo shoots, and random yoga poses on people's doorways.Fed up residents are now demanding that the city install gates at each end of the street to keep out annoying 'grammers at night and on weekends.The city of Paris has until the end of summer to figure out a working solution. Otherwise, everyone might just take to the streets.]]></description>

      <title>China leaked chat log reveals massive scope of CCP spying</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  A leak of around 364 million online records in a Chinese database has exposed the massive scope of state surveillance in China, according to the Financial Times. According to security researcher Victor Gevers at Dutch non-profit GDI Foundation, who found the database, the files show GPS locations, file transfers, identity card numbers, and chat logs. According to Gevers, the database was freely accessible online to anyone with the IP address, and user profiles were stored together with photographs, addresses and locations. He also added that the main database was providing information to 17 other servers depending on which area the data came from. According to the Financial Times, a large number of the records had the names and addresses of internet cafes on them. According to AFP, Chinese law requires internet cafes to record the identities and "relevant" online activity of users, and provide them to the public security bureau on request. This has lead to the growth of internet cafe monitoring software. The records in the databases have labels referring to Chinese social-media apps like WeChat and QQ, in addition to WeChat payment records and QQ account numbers. According to the AFP, Gevers also found another publicly accessible database that contained personal information such as ethnicity and GPS tracking data of 2.6 million people in Xinjiang.

      <title>China drops English propaganda rap</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING   China seeks to appeal to the masses by releasing English rap song promoting the CCP's annual meeting, reports The Guardian.It's no secret, China is very much eager to show off and with the Chinese communist party's annual meeting right around the corner, they're taking their propaganda to a whole new level.They decided they'd propagate their message to the entire world this year via a bizarre rap song titled, 'Two Sessions': To the World from China'. The track was released by Xinhua News, China's official state-run press agency, and was delivered by a Chinese rapper called Su HanThe video is a weird combination of stock footage-like videos mixed with shots of Su Han rapping what seems to be lyrics directly translated from Chinese using Google. He talks about how the 'joy of success is like a weekend car ride around the pool' and how he will school us in 'Chinese manners'.  The rap song tackles some real-life issues though, like poverty. In Su Han's words, 'Poverty's such a travesty, a clumsy tragedy.' True that Su Han, true that.However, not all his lyrics are that… eloquent. At one point he urges us to 'Eject all the rapaciousness like shaking off nephrolithiasis.' For those who don't have their medical lingo on check, nephrolithiasis is the medical term for kidney stones. So yeah he's telling us to shake off our rapaciousness (?) like we would shake off our kidney stones.]]></description>

      <title>Women accused of killing Kim Jong-nam await trial</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA  One of the women suspected of murdering Kim Jong Un's elder half-brother, Kim Jong-Nam is set to testify in court next week, reports the AFP.In February 2017, Kim Jong-Nam was traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Macau when he was reportedly poisoned by two women, now identified as Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam and Siti Aisyah from Indonesia. Citing unnamed police sources, state news agency Bernama reported that one woman sprayed chemicals on Kim Jong-Nam's face and immediately after, the second woman held a cloth over his face for 10 seconds. Reuters reported that traces of the deadly nerve agent VX was found on the women's clothing. VX blocks signals between the nervous system and the body's muscles. This causes muscular paralysis which results in death via asphyxiation.Malaysian officials also identified four other men at the airport who are suspected of being North Korean agents that directed the attack.The Washington Post reports that U.S. officials believe Huong and Aisyah were following direct orders from Pyongyang while Huong claims that she thought she was participating in a prank television show. Huang is believed to have been recruited by North Korean officials while working at a bar in Hanoi. North Korea has denied any type of involvement, however, the four agents who were identified by Malaysian officials fled the country soon after the attack took place.Kim Jong Nam and Kim Jong Un are both sons of former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, however, they were born to different mothers. Some speculate that Un felt threatened by his elder brother and orchestrated his assassination.]]></description>

      <title>Japanese AI cameras can spot shoplifters before they steal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  A Japanese startup has developed AI camera software that can detect if someone is likely to shoplift, according to Bloomberg.Vaak has developed artificial intelligence software that looks for potential pilferers by analyzing security camera footage for fidgeting, restlessness and other potentially suspicious body language. According to Bloomberg, the AI uses algorithms to look through security-camera video and notifies staff about possible shoplifters via a smartphone app. According to Next Shark, Vaak Eye looks at more than 100 characteristics, including a person's face, clothes, movement, stride, direction and even purpose. Demonstration videos show the software identifying a person's sex, age, location, belongings and actions while calculating a suspiciousness rate estimate. The software also keeps track of every store item a person picks up and for how long each things is held. According to IT Media, as of Dec. 12, Vaak Eye has detected at least seven shoplifters in test stores. The images of the suspects were subsequently given to po po. Vaak Eye is currently keeping an eye out in 16 stores around Tokyo. So if you're going to be in Tokyo, you better start watching your back.]]></description>

      <title>This is why 'ji32k7au4a83' is a super common password</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  If you're a person that's on the hunt for an ultra secure password, try this oneji32k7au4a83. Last week, hardware/software engineer Robert Ou asked over Twitter why ji32k7au4a83 was such a commonly spotted password on HIBP. According to Gizmodo, Have I Been Pwned is an aggregator started by security expert Troy Hunt to help people find out if their email or personal data has shown up in any big data breaches. The site can check if your password has shown up in any big data breaches, and in this case, ji32k7au4a83 been identified in 141 breaches by HIBP. But why? Blame the Taiwanese. According to Ou's Twitter responses, the password is coming from the Bopomofo system for typing Mandarin. So in Taiwan, when you want to write the Mandarin phrase "我的密碼", you type in ji32k7au4a83, which in English literally translates to "my password." Guess it's time to update '123456'.]]></description>

      <title>Homeless man, NJ woman admit to GoFundMe scam</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PHILADELPHIA  A homeless man and a New Jersey woman admitted to concocting a fake story on GoFundMe that raised over $400,000 in donations, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Military vet Johnny Bobbitt, 36, pleaded guilty in court to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Bobbitt faces six to 30 months in prison for this charge.Katelyn McClure, 28, admitted to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She's looking at up to 33 months in a federal pen. According to the Inquirer, what's even better is Bobbitt, McClure and her former boyfriend Mark D'Amico are still staring at conspiracy and theft-by-deception charges in a pending case brought by Burlington County prosecutors.The three amigos are accused of suckering 14,000 donors around the world who gave money to help Bobbitt get off the streets. Dumb, dumber and dumbest told donors Bobbitt came to McClure's rescue when she ran out of gas on an exit on Philly's I-95 one chilly night in fall of 2017.The story touched hearts as it instantly went viral, with the trio even going on national television to help sell the lie.   Too bad it all started to go haywire after Bobbitt sued the couple for not getting his fair share of the loot. Prosecutors say D'Amico and McClure blew the money on a BMW, a trip to Sin City, and trips to casinos and Disney parks. Disney parks!? Classy. D'Amico was not in court with Bobbitt and McClure, and federal prosecutors have not commented on their plans. Whatever they are, can't be good for D'Amico.Lesson of the dayif it sounds too good to be true...]]></description>

      <title>Man proves hipsters look alike by mistaking hipster photo as himself</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  An angry bro threatened to sue a magazine after claiming his photo was used in an article, only to later learn that it wasn't actually him.According to CBC, MIT Technology Review published an article in February on the "hipster effect", a phenomenon in which anticonformists all end up looking the same. With the article came a Getty stock photo of a stereotypical bearded hipster decked out in flannel and a beanie, which pissed off a reader claiming the photo was of him.On Twitter, editor-in-chief Gideon Lichfield wrote that the man accused them of slandering him by implying he was a hipster, and threatened to sue.He even had some unkind words about the study, which was simply a mathematical model explaining how folks who turn away from mainstream fashion will see their individual style choices sync up eventually.All in all, nothing scandalous, unflattering, or even remotely controversial.The publication contacted Getty Images to check that everything was A-ok, which in turn prompted Getty's legal team to dig into the matter.Turns out the model in the photo didn't have the same name as the angry emailer. And when Lichfield's team wrote back to the dude saying as much, he conceded, but didn't offer up an apology.So ironically, by misidentifying himself as the hipster in the photo, the man ended up proving the study's premise true. Guess that's 1 point for science and a glaring 0 for the beard.]]></description>

      <title>China building water absorbent 'sponge cities'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WUHAN, CHINA  China is fixing faulty drainage systems, urban flooding and water scarcity by building 'sponge cities', reports The Guardian.  Cities in China are facing many obstacles including rapid population growth, urbanization and climate change. That being said, water has been one of its main problems, particularly faulty drainage systems, urban flooding and water scarcity.China's solution to this? Building water absorbent cities. Let us explain.In 2013, China announced that its major cities would undergo water infrastructure development that would enable them to absorb and process water. The on-going project is called the Sponge City program and began in the Central City of Wuhan in Hubei province.All cities participating in the program have to guarantee that 20 percent of their urban areas have sponge features by 2020. These sponge features must be able to retain 70 percent of the city's stormwater, reports The Guardian.These sponge features include rain gardens, green space, artificial wetlands, swales and new drainage systems. In the city of Wuhan, 20 percent of the city's urban land would cover roughly 170 square kilometers out of its total urban area of 860 square kilometers.The program currently includes 30 cities. The new target requires them to ensure that 80 percent of their urban land will be capable of absorbing and re-using rain and stormwater.]]></description>

      <title>NASA preparing for first all-female space walk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BAIKONUR, KAZAKHSTAN  On March 29 NASA will conduct the first all-female spacewalk in history, reports Interesting Engineering. What a perfect way to end Women's History Month!Christina Koch and Anne McClain will be part of Expedition 59, which will also be supported on the ground by a team of women, with Mary Lawrence and Kristen Facciol serving as lead flight director and lead spacewalk flight controller.Women make up less than 11 percent of over 500 people who have been to space. Before this spacewalk, expedition teams had always been all-male or mixed.NASA calls spacewalks EVA's which stands for extravehicular activity. Spacewalks are conducted mainly for maintenance, conducting experiments or testing new equipment.McClain and Koch were both selected by NASA in 2013 and each was one of 6,100 applicants. Their class was the first in NASA history that had an equal number of male and female candidates.McClain is a major in the U.S. Army and a pilot and Koch is an electrical engineer who has worked on expeditions in the South Pole and the Arctic. Can you imagine what their resumes look like?The expedition will be a first for both women. McClain is already aboard the ISS as part of Expedition 58 but this will be her first spacewalk. For Koch, it will be her first spaceflight.And for all women on Earth, this is a giant leap for womankind.]]></description>

This technology uses two main techniques: computer vision and supervised learning, The Guardian reports.Computer vision is used to clearly identify facial expressions while supervised learning is used to train the algorithm to recognize expressions it has already seen.The company has already gathered data from 7.5 million faces in 87 countries, according to Affectiva's website.The company uses EMFACS or Emotion Facial Action Coding System to recognize facial expressions such as a scowling face for anger or a smiling face for happiness.The Guardian quotes Meredith Whittaker, from the research institute AI Now, as saying that recruiting companies and schools are already using this technique to assess facial expressions of candidates or students.She added that the technology could harm an individual if the analysis isn't completely accurate.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese guy throws coins in plane engine for good luck</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANQING, CHINA  A Lucky Air flight had some bad luck after a guy chucked a few coins at the engine before the flight for good luck. According to a Lucky Air Weibo post, Flight 8L9960 from Anqing to Kunming on Feb. 17 had to be scrapped after ground crew found two coins on the ground near the left engine. After the crew made an announcement, a 28-year-old male passenger named Lu ratted on himself and said he had tossed the coinage at the plane to keep the flight safe. The flight was immediately canceled with all 162 passengers minus Lu having to wait until the following day to be rebooked for flights to Kunming.  Lu was detained by the airport authorities. Lucky Air says the fortunate incident cost them twenty grand and have said they plan to take legal action against Lu. Funny thing is, this isn't even the first time this has happened. According to the Weibo article, this is at least number four, which everyone knows in Chinese is super lucky.The Lucky Air post then actually went on to explain the importance of engines and why they are allergic to coinsyikes.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin pursues 'sponge city' plan to deal with climate change</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  As heatwaves and urban flooding become increasingly common across northern Europe, Berlin's local government is pursuing a "sponge city" approach to address the effects of climate change.According to a report by Deutsche Welle, municipal officials are taking steps to transform Berlin into an urban sponge to allow nature itself to help cool temperatures and reduce runoff from storms.Moss and grass are being planted on rooftops to absorb rainwater. Buildings are being painted in light colors to reflect heat instead of absorbing it.Carlo Becker, the architect of Berlin's Sponge City strategy, explained to Bloomberg that the idea is to use rain water to cool the city naturally by imitating the natural water cycle.The city also plans to add more green spaces and urban wetlands to efficiently absorb rain water.Heike Stock, the official in charge of managing the program, told Deutsche Welle the idea of the urban sponge is to "avoid sealing up too much of the ground surface with concrete or tarmac" and to allow water to be absorbed into the ground through permeable surfaces.]]></description>

      <title>All you need to know about the Boeing 737 Max 8</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED STATES  The United States has told airlines the Boeing 737 Max 8 is safe to fly as investigators found two black box recorders from Sunday's downed Ethiopian Airlines jet, according to Reuters. According to Reuters, China and Indonesia have both grounded their 737 Max 8 fleets on Monday, citing safety concerns. Investigators in Ethiopia found two black box recorders early on Monday that will help authorities figure out what brought the plane down in a crash that killed 157 people. The accident comes months after the same model jet crashed in Indonesia killing 189 people. The 737 Max 8 is a single-aisle plane that has a quieter cabin, more legroom for passengers and was designed to be more fuel efficient. The plane measures 39.52 meters long, with a wingspan of 35.9 meters. It is equipped with LEAP-1B engines and has a range of 6,550 kilometers.  According to the New York Times, the 200-seat Boeing 737 Max 8 has been a popular plane after being introduced in 2017, with more than 4,000 planes ordered in the first six months.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA  A paraglider in Australiaaffectionately known as the Florida Down Underwas given a proper welcome by a couple of kangaroos. In a hilarious clip posted to Twitter by SBS News, the high flyer is seen touching down after a two hour journey. According to ITV News, Paraglider Dundee came down, sticking a nice landing in a national park, when he immediately gets greeted by two kangaroos. The paraglider offers a friendly, "What's up skip?" However, it's clear one of the kangaroos is in no mood for cheeky puns, so the joey pops him twice. The marsupials then decided to get their hop on and bounce after messing with the paraglider. What's even better, there was no phone reception in the Namadgi National Park, so dude had to pack up his paraglider and hoof it for several miles before he was able to call someone to come get him.]]></description>

      <title>Northern Red Sea coral expected to survive despite global warming</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EILAT, ISRAEL  Coral reefs near the Israeli city of Eilat are thriving despite years of extensive farm fishing and climate change.Scientists in Israel have found that coral reefs in the northern Red Sea are unusually  resistant to rising sea temperatures and acidification, according to a study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology last month.Coral in the Red Sea had been damaged by cages that were used for fish farming from 1995 to 2008. The cages have since been removed and the coral has flourished, even as coral reefs are in decline nearly everywhere else around the world.Researchers at the Inter-University Institute for Marine Sciences in Eilat theorize that the coral's resistance came about due to natural selection 18,000 years ago, when corals that were able to survive in warmer water migrated from the Indian Ocean through the Bab al-Mandab strait, where water temperatures were higher.The Associated Press quotes Jacqueline De La Cour, from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Watch, as saying this gives us hope that species would be able to adapt to survive.]]></description>

      <title>Facebook removes (then restores) Senator's anti-big tech ads</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  Facebook had removed ads placed by Warren's presidential campaign which called for tech companies, such as Facebook, to be broken up before the ads were restored, Politico reports.Warren and her team released an article on Medium last week, which says that tech giants have too much power these days and have "bulldozed competition."It also says that companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook must be broken up to promote fair competition in the marketplace.Warren also pointed out that these companies have made money out of selling private information and have hurt small businesses and "stifled innovation" in the process.To promote this campaign policy, Warren released the ads onto Facebook and elsewhere.Facebook initially took down the ads saying that it "goes against Facebook's advertising policies."Politico quotes a spokesperson from Facebook saying that the company has since restored the ads "in the interest of allowing robust debate."Warren posted a tweet saying: "Curious why I think FB has too much power? Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power."]]></description>

      <title>Chinese man's eyeball pops out after fall, doesn't realize till later</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JINAN, CHINA  A man from eastern China probably didn't see this coming when he knocked a few back while at home and slipped, SEE-riously injuring his eye. According to a Pear Video report, the spectacle occurred last Monday night when a 26-year-old guy from the Lixia district in Jinan took a tumble inside his house and knocked himself outamong other things. It's all fun and games until someone loses an eyeshould probably be some kind of Chinese proverb in this case.  His family found him the next day passed out in a pool of blood, so they rushed him to the clinic. Unfortunately, they didn't notice he was sporting a new Nick Fury look. He was later transferred to the Shandong Qianfoshan Hospital, where doctors realized something didn't look right with the man. Family members rushed home and called the hospital once they put eyes on the missing eyeball, according to Dr. Ma Baofeng from the ophthalmology department talking to local reporters. According to the doctor, the eye had been on its own for at least six hours before the patient showed up at the hospital, making it impossible to pop back in. It's still unclear what caused the eye-popping incident, but you can probably blame it on the alcohol.]]></description>

      <title>Mercury in Retrograde explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  When Mercury is in retrograde, it appears as if the planet is moving backwards when viewed from Earth's sky.This is because Mercury completes an orbit faster than Earth does, according to reports from NASA.According to Vox, as Mercury passes Earth, Earth's line of sight will shift so that Mercury will appear to retrograde for around three weeks when viewed from our planet.This is because both Mercury and Earth are orbiting the solar system at different speeds at the same time, creating an illusion that the planet is moving backwards.Mercury is currently retrograding from March 5 to March 28 and will retrograde two more times later this year, according to Newsweek.Dr. Mark Hammergren, an astronomer at Adler Planetarium, told Mental Floss that there is zero evidence that a planet retrograding is something we should worry about.]]></description>

      <title>Woman attacked by jaguar after crossing barrier to take selfie</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LITCHFIELD PARK, ARIZONA  A woman in Arizona learned the hard way that zoo barriers are there for a reason, after a close encounter with jaguar claws.CNN reports that the lady, who's in her 30s, was at the jaguar enclosure at Arizona's Wildlife World Zoo, Aquarium, and Park on Saturday, when she crossed the barrier for a photo op.She was attempting to take a selfie when the female black jaguar whose cage she was cozying up to pounced and swiped at her with its claws.According to ABC15, Adam Wilkerson and his family heard her screaming and saw the jaguar claws-deep in her arm. Wilkerson's mom shoved a water through the cage to distract the cat, and he pulled the woman back as soon as the claws were off.Paramedics were called to treat a nasty gash on the lady's left arm. She was taken to the hospital to get stitches, but was released the same day.Needless to say, there was little to no sympathy for the selfie-taker on social media, and most were more concerned that the jaguar would be put down for the attack.The zoo was firmly on their cat's side, and announced on Twitter that she'd keep all nine of her lives, since really, it was the human's fault.Though to the human's credit, she did apologize to zoo officials for all the negative publicity from her ill-advised photo op.]]></description>

      <title>North Korea's fake elections leave Dear Fat Leader off the ballot</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PYONGYANG, NORTH KOREA  North Korea just held its rubber stamp parliamentary elections and shockerthe authoritarian leadership won in a landslide.According to the BBC, one interesting thing about the fake elections was that Kim Jong-un did not appear on the ballot. If confirmed, this is the first time a North Korean dictator has not run for its pretend parliament. The regime uses the elections to legitimize its iron grip over the country, much in the same way the China uses fake elections to elect their rubber stamp National People's Congress.In North Korea's ballot, each voting slip has only one state-approved candidate on it. Well that makes deciding who to vote for easier. State media announced the names of the 687 deputies selected to the Supreme People's Assembly on Tuesday. According to the BBC, voting was mandatory for all North Koreans above the age of 17. The play parliament is chosen every five years and the turnout is always around 100 percent. But it's clear from this year's turnout that no rigging took place as the turnout was only 99.99 percent. According to NK's official news agency KCNA, that's because some were "abroad or working in oceans" so were unable to participate.]]></description>

      <title>Celebrities and coaches charged in college scam</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS  Celebrities, CEOs and college coaches from elite universities are charged for participating in a college admissions bribery scam, reports the Associated Press.Fifty people, including Oscar nominee Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin from Full House as well as CEOs and college coaches, were involved in a bribery scam in which dirty rich parents paid their kids' way into top ranking schools.Among these universities are Yale, Stanford, the University of Southern California, Wake Forest and Georgetown. The cases span from 2011 to 2019.During a press conference, FBI Special Agent Joseph Bonavolonta said the parents spent anywhere between $200,000 and $6.5 million for their children's admission.According to a cooperating witness, Loughlin allegedly paid $500,000 so both of her daughters could be enlisted as recruits for the USC rowing team. The thinking behind this was that it could help facilitate their admission. Neither had experience in the sport.According to court documents, Loughlin's husband even provided a cooperating witness implicated in the scam with staged photos of their daughters on a rowing machine for the application.Their younger daughter, Olivia Giannulli, who is a 'lifestyle' Youtuber with nearly 2 million subscribers was under fire just last year for posting a video in which she said, "I do want the experience of like game days, partying … I don't really care about school, as you guys all know."Olivia has faced a lot of backlash after the allegations of bribery became public. On an Amazon sponsored-video where she gives a tour of her USC dormitory, a YouTube user commented, "Dorm room bought by Amazon, college admissions bought by mommy.﻿"Court documents show that Laughlin and her husband were told to say that their payment was a donation that would go to underserved kids. Both their daughters were accepted to USC.Huffman, on the other hand, paid a $15,000 bribe to alter her older daughter's SAT scores. The bribe was also disguised as a donation.No students were charged according to Andrew Lelling, the US attorney for Massachusetts. In a press conference, Lelling said, "For every student admitted through fraud, an honest, genuinely talented student was rejected."]]></description>

      <title>Doomed Ethiopian Airlines plane smoked, rattled before crash</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA  Witnesses have come out to describe what they saw moments before the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.The CEO of Ethiopian Airlines told CNN that pilots of Flight 302 reported 'flight control problems' to air traffic control. This suggests the plane wasn't responding to inputs, and pilots were losing control of the aircraft.Witnesses interviewed by Reuters said they had seen smoke billowing out behind the plane, and heard a loud rattling noise, like straining and shaking metal.The farmer whose field the plane crashed in said it made a sharp turn above a field of panicked cows, while another eyewitness claimed it was trailing clothes and papers as well as smoke.The aircraft was trying to climb and lift its nose, according to two other witnesses, but failed and crashed nose-first into the ground before then exploding.According to Reuters, the debris field was roughly the size of two soccer fields.Reuters reports that investigators have recovered the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, which will be sent overseas for scrutiny.

      <title>A second Boeing 737 Max goes down in less than a year</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JAKARTA, INDONESIA  Boeing is under scrutiny as two of its aircrafts have crashed in less than a year.In October of 2018, Lion Air flight JT610 flew from Jakarta and crashed in the waters off of Java."The aircraft was also a Boeing 737 Max 8 which ended up killing all 189 passengers and crew members aboard, according to the Washington Post.An investigative report release in November of last year says a malfunctioning sensor was one of the reasons the flight crashed.The aircraft's sensor sent faulty data to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which caused an alert that the plane was in danger when it was not.This led the system to automatically position the plane's nose downward in order to prevent a stall.Since the reading was erroneous, the pilot had to struggle to correct the plane's position.The pilot was unsuccessful in his attempts to save the plane, which crashed into the sea 11 minutes after take off.According to the Washington Post, investigators are looking to see if there are similarities between the Lion Air crash and the recent plane crash in Ethiopia as both flights crashed shortly after take-off and at low altitudes.China, Indonesia and Singapore have now banned all 737 Max 8 aircrafts from their airspaces in the wake of the two plane crashes, The New York Times reports.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C.   Now US regulators are demanding Boeing make modifications to improve the aircraft, reports Al Jazeera.   The US Federal Aviation Administration is demanding Boeing make improvements toanti-stalling software and the aircrafts' maneuvering system. The FAA has given Boeing until the end of April to finalize the improvements.In an open letter to civil aviation authorities, the FAA stated that Boeing is also updating training requirements and flight crew manuals to go with the new updates to the maneuvering system. These updates include changes to the airplane flight manual, flight crew operations manual and airplane maintenance manual.According to CNN, some airlines are temporarily suspending 737 MAX 8s from flying following last Sunday's crash. These include airlines from China, Singapore, Indonesia, Mexican airline Aeromexico, Argentine airline Aerolíneas Argentinas, Cayman Airways and Comair Airways. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines among other airways have announced they will not suspend the aircraft.

      <title>Mystery database lists breed ready status of 1.8M Chinese women</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  Weird things have come out of China, but probably none as disturbing as this list straight out of The Handmaid's Tale.According to the Guardian, Dutch internet expert Victor Gevers was searching for open databases in China when he stumbled on an insecure data cache with info on over 1.8 million Chinese women.Screenshots Gevers posted of the database to Twitter shows fields labelled in English. It details names, addresses, phone numbers, and marital status, but also lists oddly specific and troubling information, such as location and whether or not they're 'breed ready.' Gevers said on Twitter that the women's ages range from 15 to 94, with the average being 32. The youngest breed ready lady is 18, the oldest 39. Eighty-nine percent are single, 10 percent divorced, and 1 percent widowed. More than 80 percent of them also live in Beijing.There's also fields in the dataset labelled "Political" and "hasvideo," followed by links to Facebook  which is still banned in China.According to Gevers' Twitter account, the database has been unavailable as of Monday afternoon.There's no telling what kind of organization the database was made for, but folks on Twitter are speculating that it could be a government registry, or a dating app.]]></description>

      <title>NASA spots hopping water on the surface of the moon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOON  Data from NASA's lunar orbiter has shed light on water movement on the moon's surface.According to NASA, scientists previously thought moon was arid, with water existing mainly as ice pockets in craters near the poles. But in recent years, they have identified surface water in sparse molecule populations bound to regolith, or lunar soil.Observations gathered by an instrument on NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter indicate that water moves around the dayside of the moon.Water molecules remain bound to the regolith until surface temperatures peak during lunar noon. They then thermally desorb and either bounce to a nearby location that is cold enough, or stick to the moon's weak atmosphere until temperatures drop and they can return to the surface.Scientists have hypothesized that hydrogen ions in the solar wind may be generating most of the moon's water. But as the supply doesn't decrease even when the moon is shielded from solar winds, it suggests water builds up over time instead of raining directly down.A paper detailing the findings has been published in the journal Geophysical Research LettersPlanetary Science Institute senior scientist and lead author Amanda Hendrix says lunar water can be used to make fuel or for radiation shielding or thermal management. This could make future missions more affordable as these materials don't need to be launched from Earth.]]></description>

      <title>Man survives being swallowed by whale</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PORT ELIZABETH, SOUTH AFRICA  A South African diver almost became the modern-day Jonas after being swallowed by a 15-meter-whale, reports Sky News.Dive tour operator Rainer Schimpf was filming a sardine run off the coast of South Africa's Port Elizabeth Harbor. His goal was to shoot some sharks hunting fish. Little did he know he'd be the one turning into chow.Schimpf told Sky News that as he was concentrated on looking for the sharks when the water around him suddenly turned black. Out of the blueliterallyhe felt a weird pressure on his hips. That's when he realized he was inside the mouth of a Bryde's whale.Bryde's whales are huge, they can weigh up to 20 tons and just one flick of this beast's flipper could easily crack some ribs. Knowing this, Schimpf decided to just wait  the big fella out and see if it would eventually let him go.Lucky for Schimpf, he didn't taste like krill. He resurfaced after the whale spat him out feeling a bit dazed and confused. His first reaction? Asking the team photographer if he got the shot."It's important to note that whales are not blood-thirsty human-eating machines. In fact, the whale Schimpf encountered was probably as confused as he was when it munched down on him.Whales are normally quite peaceful, eating shrimp, crabs, anchovies, mackerel, sardines, and other small fish and crustaceans. Okaymaybe these little guys don't think whales are so peaceful, but you get the idea.That being said, it might have been Schimp's quick reflexes that saved him. Schimpf told Sky News, 'there was not really time for fear at that moment, just pure instinct.']]></description>

      <title>U.S. grounds Boeing 737 Max aircraft after new evidence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The U.S. and Canada have joined a growing list of countries that have banned the controversial Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, following two fatal crashes that took the lives of 346 people.CBS reports that Canada's transport authority banned all Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 planes from its airspace on Tuesday. A day later, the U.S. announced it would also be grounding the aircrafts.President Trump told reporters at the White House that planes currently in the air will go their destinations, and then be grounded until further notice.According to CNBC, the Federal Aviation Administration cited new satellite evidence showing that the flight track of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 was similar to the Lion Air flight that crashed in October.According to CBS, investigators of the Lion Air crash believe pilots battled the aircraft's automated anti-stall system, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, possibly due to wrong information from sensors.Whether or not the same is true for the Ethiopian Airlines crash has yet to be determined.CNBC reports that investigators have recovered Flight 302's black boxes, and will be sending them to France for analysis this week. Over 40 countries and regions, including the EU, China, India, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil, had already grounded the 737 Max 8 and 9 due to safety concerns days before the U.S. decision.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW TAIPEI CITY, TAIWAN  A son got the umbrella beating of a lifetime from dear old dad after he was caught creeping around the ladies' dorm.According to UDN, 24-year-old IT engineer Chen snuck into the female dorm at Taiwan's Tamkang University Friday night disguised as a woman.Photos from the New Taipei City Police Department show Chen wearing a long skirt and coat, wig, glasses, and a surgical mask. He also had a scarf around his neck to hide his Adam's apple.He wasn't a very convincing crossdresser, though, because students flagged his odd appearance and constant trips to the fourth floor bathroom. A couple of ladies also caught him trying to snap shots of them in the shower, and cornered him in a stall. They also alerted an instructor, who in turn called the cops.Officers picked the perv up and found he was carrying a pinhole camera with a memory card full of nasty voyeur shots. Naturally, they did what any self-respecting Asian cop would do, and called his folks.His old man was so pissed at his pervy ways that he chased him inside the police station and beat the crap outta him with an umbrella.Chen has been transferred to the Shilin District Prosecutor's Office, where he's facing charges of Offenses Against Privacy.]]></description>

      <title>China's Muslim concentration camps continue abuses</title>
      <description><![CDATA[XINJIANG, CHINA  The U.S. State Department slammed human rights violations in China's Muslim concentration camps throughout Xinjiang as the worst "since the 1930s."According to Reuters, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought up abuses by Iran, South Sudan, Nicaragua and China in the department's annual "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices," but told the press China was "in a league of its own when it comes to human rights violations."At the same briefing, Michael Kozak, head of the State Department's human rights and democracy bureau, commented on the abuses of Uighurs in Xinjiang saying, "rounding up, in some estimations … in the millions of people, putting them into camps, and torturing them, abusing them and trying to basically erase their culture and their religion and so on from their DNA. It's just remarkably awful."That's a pretty accurate description of Chinese society as a wholeremarkably awful.  China initially lied about the concentration camps, even though the entire world knew they were lying. Beijing then tried their typical sideshow antics of saying they had boarding schools rather than concentration camps. To be clear, even blind people can see they're concentration camps. The State Department report says Chinese goons have arbitrarily locked 800,000 to probably more than two million Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and other Muslims in camps with the sole purpose of erasing religious and ethnic identities.]]></description>

Apparently, the mother, in the process of getting from the boarding area at the terminal of the King Abdulaziz International Airport to the aircraft forgot one little thingher baby. In a video posted to YouTube, the pilot is heard asking an air traffic controller, "May God be with us. Can we come back?"   The guy in tower is then heard asking other colleagues what the proper protocol is for baby chilling at terminal with no mama. "The flight is requesting to come back," he tells someone else. "A passenger forgot her baby in the waiting area, the poor thing." Seriouslyand to think, it's only just beginning for this kid.

      <title>Flight delayed after Chinese passengers throw coins for luck</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JINAN, CHINA  Chinese women were escorted off a flight for throwing good luck coins at the plane's engine before the trip, delaying the flight for two hours, reports Beijing News. There are several things you can do ensure your travel plans go smoothly. Print out copies of your passport, label your luggage, pack extra toiletries and oh...Don't throw coins into the plane's engine.Apparently, this isn't common knowledge. According to Beijing News, two women on board a Lucky Air flight from Jinan to Chengdu delayed the flight for two whole hours after being spotted tossing coins at the plane's engine like it was some sort of wishing well.Sure enough, nothing bad happened on their flight...because they were kicked off of it. After making sure the coinage hadn't wrecked the engines, airport authorities escorted the ladies off the plane.Lucky Air hasn't confirmed whether or not it will take legal action against the women. If they do, these ladies are going to have to drop some coin and lawyer up.China has had the good fortune to have this preflight ritual happen at least five times, three of which have happened on Lucky Air flights. Guess they are pretty lucky to keep getting such awesome passengers.]]></description>

      <title>Facebook's big tech data deals are under criminal investigation: NYT</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  Facebook is now under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors for data-sharing deals it struck with other tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Sony, according to the New York Times. Two anonymous sources told the New York Times that at least two high-profile electronic companies have been subpoenaed to provide records to a grand jury in New York. The files are said to concern the companies' partnerships with Facebook.Facebook had previously let companies view users' friends and contact information among other data, according to the New York Times.

      <title>Japan's space agency and Toyota are making a moon car</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JAPAN  Japan's space agency and Toyota are teaming up to build a lunar exploration vehicle as part of the country's plan to get astronauts on the moon by 2029, The Japan Times reports.Toyota and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency are to construct a pressurized self-driving moon rover that will use the car manufacturer's fuel cell vehicle technology.According to Forbes, a fuel cell vehicle or FCV uses a fuel cell of compressed hydrogen and oxygen. These molecules react with each other to create electricity for the vehicle.Toyota said in a press release, that these fuel cells only emit water and can generate a lot of energy.The rover will be six meters wide and 3.8 meters tall. This is around the size of two microbuses, according to a JAXA news release.With 13 cubic meters of space, the vehicle is expected to have a 2 to 4 passenger carry capacity.According to Toyota, the rover will be able to travel more than 10,000 km on the moon's surface. The country is planning a series of manned missions to the moon between 2029 and 2034, The Japan Times reports.]]></description>

      <title>Slovenian woman saws off  hand to get insurance payout</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA   A woman in Slovenia is being accused of deliberately losing her hand in order to claim hundreds of thousands of euros in insurance money.According to the BBC, relatives took the 21-year-old to a hospital in January following what they claim was an accident with a circular saw while sawing branches.But the cops weren't buying it, instead accusing the lady and her family of insurance fraud.Police told ABC News that the woman had taken out five different insurance policies in the months leading up to her "accident" and would've gotten €400,000 or about $430,000 for her injury, with monthly payments of $3,388 for ten years.They believe the woman, with one of her accomplices, cut off her left hand just above the wrist and deliberately didn't bring it to the hospital to ensure a permanent disability. But they were foiled when doctors called the po-po to retrieve the hand, and then sewed it back on.The woman and a 29-year-old relative have both been detained, and could face up to 8 years in prison if convicted of insurance fraud.But hey, at least she's got her hand back.]]></description>

      <title>Florida woman shoots boyfriend for snoring too loudly</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COCOA, FLORIDA  A lady in Florida went crazy on her new boyfriend after a booze-fueled argument about his loud snoring.According to the arrest affidavit, Lorie Morin and Brett Allgood had been dating for all of three weeks when their night troubles came to a pretty violent head.Allgood was anything but a silent sleeper, and his super loud snoring disturbed Morin so much one night that she elbowed him in the ribs to wake him up. He spent the rest of the night on the couch.In an attempt to make it up to his girlfriend, he showed up the next day with flowers, chocolates, a bottle of her favorite rum, and snoring strips.Booze was maybe not the best idea though, because several rum cokes later, Morin suddenly started ramming into Allgood about his snoring.While he tried to leave to avoid a fight, crazy drunk lady picks up her shotgun and blasts him in the side. When the cops showed up, she fed them a fake sob story about the gun accidentally going off while they were packing stuff.Luckily, Allgood survived his shooting and later set the story straight. The cops arrested Morin after getting her to fess up to everything.According to court documents, the 47-year-old is being charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery.]]></description>

      <title>Recent 737 Max 8 crashes unrelated says aviation expert</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED STATES  Despite some similarities between the two recent Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes, aviation expert Peter Lemme talking to Scientific American believes they are unrelated.Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on Sunday shortly after takeoff killing all 157 people on board. The Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft was the same type involved in the Indonesia Lion Air Flight 610 crash five months earlier. Both flights appeared to have difficulties sustaining a normal climb, and fell shortly after takeoff.A possible cause of the Indonesia crash was a malfunction in the automated anti-stalling feature called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. According to Scientific American, because Boeing outfitted the Max with bigger engines, their placement relative to the plane's center of gravity causes a tendency for the nose to tip upward. The MCAS is designed to automatically push the nose back down when this happens, preventing the aircraft from stalling, or losing lift.  In the case of Lion Air, experts suspect a faulty sensor may have triggered MCAS to engage when the plane was flying normally, causing the nose to repeatedly dip. Using data from FlightRadar24, Lemme studied how Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 flew in the six minutes before disappearing from radar. With Flight 302, the plane got to 1,000 feet, which at that point lost about 400 feet of altitude. The plane then flew level for about 30 seconds, about 500 to 600 feet above the ground, which according to Lemme is not normal.  The airspeed continued to increase to over 300 knots at under 1,000 feet above ground. After that 30-second period, the plane began to climb normally until they disappeared from radar. Now that the black boxes have been recovered from Flight 302, investigators will see what information they reveal about the cause of the crash.]]></description>

      <title>An Asteroid NASA wants to sample is spinning very fast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  Asteroid Bennu has been found to revolve quicker over time, according to research published in Geophysical Research Letters.NASA's OSIRIS-REx began approaching the asteroid last year. The spacecraft travelled 2.2 million kilometers from Earth and stationed itself 19 kilometers from Bennu.The discovery was made via ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope. Scientists looked at data from 1999, 2005 and 2013 and observed that the asteroid was increasing its rotational speed over time. According to the study, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will independently determine Bennu's speed of rotation by flying closer to the asteroid."The scientists believe that sunlight may be causing Bennu to spin faster as it hits the asteroid from various angles. This is known as the YORP effect.Asteroid Bennu is currently traveling across space at 101,000 kilometers per hour and is able to complete a rotation every 4.3 hours.According to the study, Bennu's speed of rotation has increased by around 1 second per century. The asteroid is estimated to be around 4.5 billion years old.OSIRIS-REx was sent to collect data and sample the asteroid using the Osiris Visible and Infrared Spectrometer and Osiris Thermal Emission Spectrometer.The spacecraft will use its Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism to extract rocks and dirt from the surface of asteroid Bennu in July of 2020.It is expected to travel back to Earth and drop off a capsule containing asteroid samples in September 2023.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists reverse time
using quantum computer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOSCOW   A team of researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology used a quantum system program to reverse the state of a quantum computer a fraction of a second into the past.According to the paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, they performed the experiments on two quantum bits, also known as qubits. Qubits are represented by a one, a zero or both at the same time.During the first stage of the experiment, the two qubits were unaltered. In the second stage, called 'degradation,' scientists used a computer program to alter the order of the previous stage, causing the qubits to become a random assortment of ones and zeros.This process is then followed by the time reversal stage. At this time the program reverses the chaotic effect on the qubits. Finally, during the 'regeneration' stage, the qubit reverts to the same original state before it had been disrupted by the computer program.The program was able to successfully restore 85 percent of the cases where two qubits where involved.Through this program, the researchers were able to create a state that evolved against the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the state of entropy or disruption of the universe increases over time. Meaning that changes of a state in a closed system can remain static but cannot be reversed.The researchers used the example of cue balls on a pool table. Imagine them formed in a pyramid shape at the center and then being hit, causing them to disperse.Now imagine the process in reverse. The balls retrace the path they took when they were hit and return to the original triangular formation. This is similar to what the researchers accomplished with quantum bits.Although this doesn't mean we will be traveling through time on a DeLorean anytime soon, it will help us achieve a deeper understanding of quantum physics and time.]]></description>

      <title>China 'indirectly benefiting' from Google, says US general</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  One of the highest-ranking U.S. military officials said this week that Google's collaboration with China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military, reports Reuters. U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford spoke on the matter during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing this week.During the meeting he said, quote: "We watch with great concern when industry partners work in China knowing that there is that indirect benefit." End quote. In contrast, Google has been withdrawing from partnerships with the U.S. Military. In 2018, the tech giant said it would no longer be competing for a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. Google stated that the reason behind this was that the company's principles did not align with the DoD project.In June 2018, Google announced it would not be renewing a contract that allowed the U.S. military to analyze aerial drone imagery after it had expired.A spokesperson from Google told CNN that although they have backed out from projects with the Pentagon they are still working closely with the military in other ventures.The spokesperson also added, quote, 'We deeply respect the US military and we are working with them to solve problems in areas like cybersecurity, logistics, transportation, and planning'. End quote.'Google's collaboration with China has made the world a bit uneasy. Last March, Google's plans to create a censored search engine called Dragonfly tailored specifically for China ended after it caused internal conflicts among the company's privacy team, according to reports by The Intercept.Prior to the internal issue, human rights groups including Chinese and Uighurs protested against the Dragonfly project outside Google's offices around the world.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NIMBIN, AUSTRALIA  It's not everyday your phone is an actual lifesaver, but in the case of this guy Down Underthat's exactly what it was.According to the BBC, police say a 43-year-old man in the town of Nimbin, about 110 miles south of Brisbane, had a bit of a dust up with another man on Wednesday. According to the po po, it all went down when the attacker, carrying a bow and arrow, got into it with the man outside his house. The guy then took out his phone to photograph Rambo First Blood Part II.This caused the suspect to try out his best Hawkeye impression and let one loose. Amazingly, the arrow only pierced the guy's phone, knocking it back into his face. Luckily, he only suffered a small cut.   Robin Hood, 39, was later busted at the scene by authorities. According to the cops, the two guys knew each other. Robin Hood Men in Tights was charged with assault and property damage offences, and is scheduled to appear in court next month.]]></description>

      <title>You may be able to use your face to pay for a China subway ride</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SHENZHEN, CHINA  A subway station in Shenzhen is testing facial recognition software to allow riders to pay the fare with their face, according to the South China Morning Post. At the Futian station, rather than using a ticket or scanning a QR code on a smartphone, commuters can scan their faces on a tablet-sized screen at the entrance gate. Their fare is then automatically deducted from their linked accounts. And all you have to do is register your biometric facial data beforehand with the subway operator, who will definitely be sharing that with the CCP, if they don't have it already. The plus side to this system, you don't have to worry about forgetting your subway card again. The downside...it makes it that much easier for Emperor Xi and his goons to keep constant tabs on everyone. The algorithms for the facial recognition tech were designed in a lab run by Shenzhen Metro and Huawei. Shenzhen Metro did not give a timeline as to when this big brother tech will roll out at all stations. China has already been using facial recognition to pay for things. At KFC stores across China since 2017, people can buy fried chicken by scanning their face. Wow...that's pretty earth-shattering considering how hard it is to buy fried chicken is this world. But seriously, it's only your biometric data. And don't worry, China would never do anything sketchy with that data like spy or keep tabs on people.]]></description>

      <title>Man develops brain infection after cleaning ear with cotton swab</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COVENTRY, UNITED KINGDOM  A man in the UK developed a skull infection years after getting part of a cotton swab lodged in his ear.According to a case study published in BMJ Case Reports, a 31-year-old from Coventry was rushed to the hospital after collapsing and suffering seizures.Doctors diagnosed him with necrotising otitis externa, which is a bacterial infection that started in the ear and spread to the bone, targeting the lining of the skull. The man had reported pain and discharge from his left ear ten days before he was hospitalized, along with nasty headaches, nausea, and vomiting. More worryingly, he'd been starting to forget people's names, and later admitted he had been experiencing intermittent ear pain and hearing loss for the past five years.A CT scan revealed two inflamed patches full of pus in the base of his skull, right beside his left ear canal.Doctors went in to treat the infection, but instead found the tip of a cotton bud surrounded by wax. They removed the Q-tip tip and put him on hospital rest and a two-month course of antibiotics, according to the Coventry Telegraph. The man is now infection-free, and will probably never use a cotton swab ever again.]]></description>

      <title>Russian submarine capable of carrying six nuclear devices</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOSCOW  Russia's state media has announced that its navy will begin to test a war submarine capable of carrying six thermonuclear warheads.According to The Barents Observer, Russia's new war submarine called 'Belgorod' will be the world's longest submarine ever built, measuring 184 meters.Russian state media, TASS, reports that the Belgorod will be able to carry six underwater drones called 'Poseidon'.Each of these drones is capable of carrying nuclear warheads weighing up to 2 megatons. Their operational depth is 1,000 meters, making them difficult to intercept.Foreign Minister of Norway Ine Eriksen Soreide told The Barents Observer that it was 'worrying that countries are developing new nuclear capabilities.'According to Russian state media, the Belgorod will be deployed by summer 2019.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[MANHATTAN, NEW YORK  New York's mayor has plans to expand Manhattan's coastline to safeguard the island from the effects of climate change.Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to artificially extend the southern tip of Manhattan to protect it from rising sea levels and storm surges, the New York Times reports.According to a Lower Manhattan Climate Resilience Study, 37 percent of Lower Manhattan will be at risk from a storm surge by 2050.In an op-ed published in New York Magazine, de Blasio said the coastline of Lower Manhattan will be extended as much as 500 feet into the East River.Landfill will be used to extend the coastline. This would create a rising berm that would be above future sea levels, according to the New York Times.He added that grassy berms in parks and removable barriers will also be used to protect the island from storm surges.According to de Blasio's op-ed in New York Magazine, the coastal extension project will cost around US$10 billion.]]></description>

      <title>Green tea reduces risk of obesity in mice</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COLUMBUS, OHIO  Research from Ohio State University has found that green tea lowered the risk of obesity in mice.The scientists tested their hypothesis on a group of male mice. Half of the mice were fed a high-fat diet while the rest were fed healthy meals.They further separated the two groups into two sub-groups.Half of the mice that were fed a high-fat diet had a green tea extract mixed into their foods while the other half did not. The extract was also placed in the meals of 50 percent of the mice that were fed a normal diet.Researchers observed that mice on a high-fat diet mixed with green tea had gained around 20 percent less weight than those whose diet didn't consist of any green tea.The green tea fed mice were also found to have lower insulin resistance and healthier microbes in their body, according to the study.Lead author of the study Professor Richard Bruno, speaking on the Ohio State University website, said, "This study provides evidence that green tea encourages the growth of good gut bacteria, and that leads to a series of benefits that significantly lower the risk of obesity."]]></description>

      <title>China college class requires students get WeChat friends</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ZHENGZHOU, CHINA  A Chinese professor apparently gave his students one of the dumbest college assignments of all timeadd as many possible friends on WeChat. According to the BBC, students unlucky enough to be taking the the Internet and New Media course at Henan University of Economics and Law were given the pointless assignment on March 10.  It's weird taking a class in China on the internet, when all they have is a insanely censored and policed intranet. Anyways, according to the students, they need to add at least 1,000 new WeChat buddies to pass the assignment, which accounts for 30 percent of their final grade. Think of WeChat as basically a WhatsApp knockoff. To get full marks on the assignment, students are required to add 1,667 friends. Some students reached out to Pear Video to complain about the assignment. In response, a teacher from the college tried to write a letter to explain the idea was to prepare students for real life. "This assignment comes from a core module in the course. What we're saying is that afterwards, when these students look for work, they will have the basic skills necessary for this type of social media operation."So basically, it's teaching them nothing. Apparently, the Pear Video story has been seen more than seven million times on Weibo, China's Twitter knockoff, and has attracted more than 10,000 comments. No wonder Chinese people send their kids to study in the U.S.]]></description>

      <title>Boeing 737 Max 8 pilots trained on iPads instead of flight simulators</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  As investigations continue into the causes of recent Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes, pilot training has now become a focus, according to the New York Times. Specifically, if pilots were sufficiently prepared for the new software on the aircraft. When the plane was introduced, Boeing thought that pilots who had flown earlier models didn't need additional simulator training and U.S. regulators agreed. According to the New York Times, normally for new plane models, pilots train for hours in huge flight simulators. This didn't happen with the Max line of planes. Instead, many pilots with 737 experience learned about the plane by looking at an iPad for two hours. Part of the reason was that as Boeing rushed to finish the plane, flight simulators made for the Max weren't ready. Greg Bowen, the training and standards chair at the Southwest pilots association, was told by senior leadership at the airline the engineering data necessary to design simulator software was still being finalized right up until the plane was nearly completed. According to Bowen, "they were building the airplane and still designing it. The data to build a simulator didn't become available until about when the plane was ready to fly."What's more troubling is that the training that was provided by Boeing did not cover any of the new software that would be used in the 737.]]></description>

      <title>Moisturizer could reduce risk of age-related disease, study finds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Scientists have found that using a skin moisturizer might reduce the risk of developing diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes.A small pilot study by the University of California, San Francisco found that inflammation of the skin may play a role in chronic illnesses.Around age 50, our skin begins to lose moisture and the skin's permeability barrier starts to break down. The barrier acts as a shield to retain water in our bodies and keep pathogens out.In younger skin, inflammatory cytokines are released to help repair cracks in the barrier.As the skin ages and the barrier weakens, more cytokines are released by the immune system.Cytokines eventually enter the bloodstream, and according to the study can cause inflammation that affects the rest of the body.The study had 33 participants between the ages of 58 and 95. They were asked to apply moisturizer twice a day for a month.The moisturizer contained cholesterol, free fatty acids and ceramides  all of which are essential for skin health.The scientists observed that the cytokine levels of the participants were found to be nearly equivalent with people in their thirties at the end of one month.In a news release the University of California, San Francisco said the researchers now plan to conduct a large scale study to test if moisturizing creams can actually delay or prevent age-related diseases caused by inflammation.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE  A team of researchers have detected planets forming around a young star similar to the sun according to a press release from ALMA.  According to the paper published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, DM Tau is located in the Taurus constellation 470 light-years away from Earth. It is between three and five million years old and weighs roughly half the mass of the sun.The researchers spotted the system forming using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array known as ALMA.ALMA is a radio telescope that captures radio waves from the universe. It is located in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.Using the ALMA, scientists were able to view two rings of dust forming around the star. The inner ring is 4 astronomical units, known as AU,  from the star and the second ring is 20 AU away. Scientists believe this is where the planets are forming.The team hopes to gain a better understanding of the origin of planets like Earth by studying the formation of this neighboring solar system.]]></description>

      <title>Eating too many eggs increases heart disease risk, study says</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  Not egg-specially good news if you happen to be a fan of eggs. According to a new study, eating too many delicious eggs can increase risks of heart disease and permanent sleep. According to Northwestern Now, the large-scale Northwestern Medicine study examined pooled data on 29,615 U.S. racially and ethnically diverse adults from six prospective cohort studies for up to 31 years of follow up. The study was published last Friday in the medical journal JAMA. According to co-author of the study Norrina Allen, "the take-home message is really about cholesterol, which happens to be high in eggs and specifically yolks.""As part of a healthy diet, people need to consume lower amounts of cholesterol. People who consume less cholesterol have a lower risk of heart disease."One large egg can have up to 186 milligrams of dietary cholesterol in the yolk. Eating less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day used to be the U.S. dietary guideline recommendation, until it was dropped in 2015. The study found eating 300 mg of dietary cholesterol per day was associated with 17 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 18 percent higher risk of all-cause deaths. The cholesterol was the driving factor independent of saturated fat consumption and other dietary fat. They also found eating three to four eggs a week was associated with 6 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 8 percent higher risk of any cause of death. So does this mean giving up eggs and red meat? Of course notmoderation is the key. And maybe cut out the daily three-egg breakfast omelette.]]></description>

      <title>'Clear similarities' between Ethiopian and Lion Air crashes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ADDIS ABABA   There are "clear similarities" between Indonesia's Lion Air and Ethiopian Air crashes, according to the Ethiopian government.AFP reports that Ethiopia's transport minister, Dagmawit Moges, told a press conference on Sunday that flight data recorders from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 have been recovered in good condition. So far the data extracted shows similarities between the Ethiopian Airlines crash and the Lion Air crash that occurred in October 2018.According to the AFP,  both aircrafts experienced irregular climbs and descents as well as fluctuations in altitude before crashing minutes after take off. Experts also identified issues with the plane's automated Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which stops the plane from stalling.According to the New York Times, new evidence suggests that the stabilizers on the Ethiopian Airlines flight were tilted upwards and forcing down the nose of the plane.Flight recordings and cockpit voice recordings from the Ethiopian Airlines flight have been sent to France's air safety agency for further analysis. They are working in collaboration with American and Ethiopian investigators.]]></description>

      <title>Artificial meat: Scientists make bacon on blades of grass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BATH, ENGLAND  A team of researchers from the University of Bath have developed bacon fibers using pig stem cells and blades of grass, reports the BBC.First, they take a tissue sample from a pig and extract stem cells from the tissue. Stem cells have the capacity of turning into different kinds of cells including muscle, fat or ligaments. After the cells are isolated they are placed in a container for cultivation. They are then placed on blades of grass where they continue to grow into meat fibers.Millions of muscle, fat and ligament cells are required to make a single fiber of bacon. This makes it difficult for cultured meat to be produced at a large scale and sold commercially.Lab-grown meat is expensive. Back in 2013 a group of scientists in the Netherlands made the first lab-meat burger, and it cost over US$280,000 due to the time and effort that was needed to cultivate the cells.Scientists are hoping this new method can be an alternative for the future of lab meat production.According to the BBC, lab-grown meat won't be commercially available for at least five more years.]]></description>

      <title>New technique generates hydrogen fuel from seawater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[STANFORD, CALIFORNIA  Stanford researchers have developed a water-splitting system that can produce clean hydrogen fuel using saltwater.According to a Stanford University press release, hydrogen fuel can be generated via electrolysis, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. The process typically uses fresh or purified water, as saltwater has been known to corrode.A new system developed by a team of Stanford scientists uses solar cells to power two electrodes in water, causing hydrogen gas comes out of the cathode, and oxygen to come out of the anode.To prevent corrosion from the chloride in saltwater, negatively charged nickel layers were coated on to the anode to create a barrier.Nickel foam conducts electricity, and nickel-iron hydroxide sparks electrolysis. Nickel sulfide, repels chloride and prevents it from getting to the core metal.The multi-layer device can run for more than a thousand hours, compared to just 12 without the negatively charged coating. It can also conduct 10 times more electricity and help generate hydrogen from seawater at a faster rate.According to the team, the technology have other applications beyond generating energy, such as generating breathable oxygen underwater for divers or submarines.]]></description>

      <title>Huge meteor explodes in Earth's atmosphere</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, RUSSIA  A fireball entered Earth's atmosphere and exploded with the energy of 173 kilotons of TNT, according to data collected by NASA.The US Air Force reported a massive explosion just 25.6km above the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Russia over the Bering Strait. The BBC reports the explosion took place last year on December 18.According to NASA, the meteor entered Earth's atmosphere at 32 kilometers per second with an impact energy of roughly 173 kilotons. This is ten times the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb.Using NASA data, meteor specialist Peter Brown at Western University in Canada calculated that the meteor was 10 meters wide and weighed 1,400 tons. According to The Guardian, the explosion was recorded by a network of infrasound sensors which are used to detect covert nuclear bomb tests.This meteor explosion was the third largest fireball to enter Earth's atmosphere in modern times, following the 2013 Chelyabinsk explosion and the Tunguska fireball in 1908. All of these explosions have occurred in Russia.]]></description>

      <title>Design issues with the Boeing 737 Max 8</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED STATES  The crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29, 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 409 on March 10 have brought attention to the design and software of the Boeing 737 Max 8. According to Asia Times, the 737 Max series is equipped with new CFM Leap-1B engines, which forced re-engineering of part of the airplane. Fitting the new engines meant moving them forward and lengthening the front landing gear to keep the engines from scraping the ground. This changed the plane's center of gravity and also altered the airflow on the wings.  The new, heavier and larger engines resulted in Max planes having a strong tendency to pitch nose up, which is why the MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, was introduced. According to Asia Times, MCAS was a suboptimal fix to the pitch problem created by relocating the newer engines. It is designed to push the nose down and prevent the plane from going into a stall. MCAS was intended to deal only with a specific flight risk.]]></description>

      <title>Bodycam video shows why Miami Dade po po was suspended</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MIAMI  Miami-Dade police suspended an officer for his actions during the arrest of a woman who claimed a man pointed a shotgun at her. The cop had threatened to involuntarily commit the woman to a hospital, told her he didn't like her tone of voice, and threatened to arrest her if she didn't calm down. According to the Miami Herald, bodycam footage released by the police shows Dyma Loving never threatened the officer. She spoke clearly and only became slightly agitated after Officer Alejandro Giraldo's threats.On March 5, Loving and Adrianna Green, 22, called the police after a man named Frank Tumm, who lives next door to Green, pointed a shotgun at them. The two told police they were walking past Tumm's house when they got into a verbal altercation. Tumm had retrieved a shotgun and pointed it at them. Police later arrested Tumm, after originally letting him go.But the real story is how Officer Alejandro Giraldo completely lost it during the arrest. In the video, Giraldo repeatedly yells at Loving to calm down and to chill out, when clearly he's the only one who is freaking out. And like you'd expect, Giraldo eventually throws Loving in cuffs and arrests her. Loving was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest without violence. Giraldo was suspended last week by Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez after cellphone video of the crazy arrest taken by a friend of Loving made the rounds on social media.]]></description>

      <title>Changes in ocean conveyor belt foretold major climate shifts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  In the Atlantic Ocean, a giant 'conveyor belt' carries warm waters from the tropics into the North Atlantic, where they cool and sink and then return south to the deep ocean.Ocean water circulation affects global climate, regulating weather patterns in the Arctic, Europe and around the world. More and more research suggests this conveyor belt system is slowing down, causing some scientists to fear it could cause temperatures to plummet in Europe and warming waters off the east coast of the U.S.According to a Columbia University press release, a new study published in Nature Communications has provided insight into how quickly changes in Atlantic Ocean circulation could affect major climate changes.  The study was carried out by researchers at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, working with the Norwegian Research Center. It was the first to precisely calculate the time lags between past changes to the ocean conveyor belt and major climate changes.The study looked at the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, and specifically focused on a section where water sinks from the surface to the bottom of the North Atlantic. Researchers took sediment core samples drilled from the bottom of the Norwegian Sea, a lake sediment core from southern Scandinavia, and ice cores from Greenland. Comparing data from the three cores revealed that the AMOC started weakening about 400 years before a major cold snap 13,000 years ago. It began strengthening again about 400 years before an abrupt warming 11,000 years ago.]]></description>

      <title>Beijing plans island city on Woody Island in the Paracels</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SOUTH CHINA SEA  The Chinese government has announced plans to build up a strategic island in the Paracels, despite strong opposition from the U.S.The South China Morning Post reports that China is planning to build an 'island city' on Woody Island and neighboring islets Tree and Drummond. According to the Communist Party secretary of Sansha, the aim is to turn the island and two islets into a national key strategic service and logistics base.According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, Woody Island is China's main military base in the Paracels, and is equipped with an airstrip, aircraft hangars, ports, and missiles.Woody Island is also home to a settlement of about 1,000 people, and serves as the administrative capital of the three island chains it claims in the South China Sea.The U.S. has long criticized China's expansion and militarization of the disputed region, and challenges territorial claims with freedom of navigation operations, despite protests from Beijing.According to the South China Morning Post, two American B-52H Stratofortress bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons flew over the South China Sea on March 14 for the second time in 10 days.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also spoke out last week criticizing China's 'illegal island-building in international waterways.' He also accused Beijing of using coercive means to block energy development in the South China Sea.]]></description>

      <title>Flat Earthers plan Antarctic expedition to edge of the Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NOT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD  Some people will go to the ends of the Earth just to prove something. For flat earthers, it's all too literal. According to Forbes, the latest plan to win the disk vs ball debate involves an Antarctic expedition to reach the edge of the world. The "real exact science," Flat Earth International Conference founder Robbie Davidson told Forbes, is that if you squish down a globe, Antarctica would be an ice shore that goes all the way around the Earth.It would have been nice to just have the crazies all sail right off the face of the planet. But apparently we're also in a dome, so that's not gonna happen.The flat earthers claim the Antarctic ice wall stretches 60,000 miles on a pancake vs just 14,500 on a ball, and think that by sailing around its coast, they can get the distance to flat out prove their point.According to Forbes, this all stems from a belief that the UN Antarctic Treaty of 1961 doesn't allow private explorations of Antarctica. Nevermind that a dude just did a solo trek across the continent, complete with GPS proof. But since the G in GPS stands for globe, the flat earthers are having none of it.In any case, we're all looking forward to that Antarctic expedition. Let's hope they get that spectacular failure on video.]]></description>

      <title>Snake catcher removes 45 rattlesnakes from under house</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALBANY, TEXAS  A north-central Texas homeowner was watching some television last week, when the cable started acting up, according to KWQC.According to a Facebook post by Big Country Snake Removal, the man snaked his way under the house and ran into "a few" rattlesnakes, so he made a tactical retreat and called in the pros. According to KWQC, when guys from Big Country Snake Removal had a look for themselves, they MAY have counted more than a FEW. They posted an almost 18-minute long video of the hours long removal job to Facebook, which has already racked up more than a million views. According to the post, the snake catchers arrived around lunchtime and immediately upon crawling under, could see they were dealing with a whole mess of rattlers45 to be exact.  The video shows Big Country owner Nathan Hawkins and a partner take the snakes out one by one from the small crawl space under the house. The house was clean with a well-kept yard, but the post wisely added, "rattlesnakes don't care how nice your house is or what kind of car you drive- they simply care about survival."]]></description>

      <title>China clones its best police dog</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  Chinese authorities have successfully cloned one of their top police dogs, reports Chinese state media, global Times. China's top police doggo, a Kunming wolfdog called Huahuangma, is so good at sniffing out drugs and perps that in 2016 the Chinese Ministry of Public Security classified her as a first-class meritorious dog. They decided they needed more dogs exactly like her. So they cloned her.According to Chinese state media, Global Times, researchers from the Sinogene Biotechnology Company and the Yunnan Agricultural University have cloned the wonder dog in an attempt to test whether or not it would be viable to mass-produce police dogs.The cloned doggie, called Kunxun, was a success. Chinese authorities claim her DNA is 99.9 percent similar to Huahuangma's. Kunxun is now three months old and will begin training in crowd control, drug detection and evidence retrieval. She will graduate at 10 months old. If successful, Kunxun would have trained to become a police dog in record time. According to the Global Times, it usually takes five years for a pooch to become a police dog and costs roughly $60,000. They did not state the cost of cloning.China is not the first to mass produce professional dog investigators. That trophy goes to South Korea. According to ABC news, in 2009 South Korea deployed drug-sniffing dogs that had been cloned from a Labrador retriever proficient in drug sniffing.]]></description>

      <title>Exxon Valdez Spill: It's been 30 years since one of the US biggest oil spills</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND, ALASKA   The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska was one of the biggest U.S. oil spills ever to occur, according to the Atlantic. Today we revisit how it happened.According to The Atlantic, on March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker was entering Alaska's Prince William Sound. It had departed from the Trans Alaska Pipeline terminal on March 23 at 9:12 pm and was carrying 53.1 million gallons of oil.At 12:04 am the tanker slammed into Bligh Reef, tearing open its hull and spilling 11 million gallons of oil into the water and the surrounding environment. That's the equivalent of 17 Olympic-sized swimming pools.According to Scientific American, nearly 2,000 kilometers of the shoreline were contaminated. Wildlife in the area was also severely damaged. Thousands of otters, harbor seals, seabirds and fish were killed.According to the Environmental Protection Agency, three methods were used to clean up the spill: burning the oil on the water's surface, mechanical cleanup via oil skimmers and chemical dispersants.High-pressure hot water was also used to clean the surrounding beaches until it was determined that it was cooking microorganisms present in the shores which in turn damaged the soil.According to a case study by the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited, Exxon Mobil had to pay $4.3 billion as a consequence of the spill in addition to the $2 billion it spent the first year on clean-up efforts.The Exxon Valdez oil spill is the second largest spill in history second to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, where an explosion at a BP oil rig killed eleven workers and spilled 53,000 barrels of oil per day for three months.]]></description>

      <title>Hong Kong plans massive $79 billion artificial island project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HONG KONG  Hong Kong has announced plans to spend $79 billion to construct one of the world's largest artificial island projects.The Guardian reports that Hong Kong is planning to build 1,000 hectares of artificial islands off the coast of Lantau Island.The project, called 'Lantau Vision Tomorrow,' is more than twice the size of Dubai's Palm Jumeirah, which was also created by land reclamation.According to the South China Morning Post, the first phase will provide up to 260,000 residential units, 70 percent of which will be reserved for public housing.A new transport network is also being built, which will include road and rail links to connect the future man-made islands to Hong Kong Island, Lantau, and Tuen Mun.The plan has received criticism from environmental groups, who say the building work will be damaging to local species such as the endangered pink dolphin.The Guardian reports that Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund have argued that authorities should instead develop former industrial areas called brownfield sites, arguing that it is cheaper and less harmful to the environment.Reclamation work on 'Lantau Vision Tomorrow' is scheduled to begin in 2025, with the first residents expected to move in by 2032.]]></description>

      <title>Crashed 737 Max jets lacked safety features Boeing sold as extras</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  The doomed 737 Max jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia were not equipped with two notable safety features because Boeing charged an additional cost to install them.According to the New York Times, the MCAS software on the Boeing 737 Max takes readings from one of two angle of attack sensors on the plane that aligns itself with oncoming airflow.If MCAS detects that the plane is pointed up at a dangerous angle, it automatically swivels the horizontal stabilizer and pushes the nose down to prevent stalling.Two optional safety features could have kept the MCAS in check: the angle of attack indicator displays readings from both sensors, and the disagree light activates when the sensors' data do not match.Both features were sold by Boeing as optional extras and were not included on the crashed Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines planes.According to the New York Times, the safety features could have helped pilots detect any erroneous readings. This would have also allowed a manual override of the system.The Times, citing a Boeing bulletin, says this can be done by temporarily counteracting the MCAS movement, cutting off electrical power to the stabilizers, and then cranking a wheel to manually pull them back to the correct position.Experts told the newspaper that the two features are vital for flight safety. But because neither is mandated by the FAA, Boeing was able to sell them as upgrades.The company has since announced that it will make the disagree light standard on all new 737 aircrafts, but the angle of attack indicator will remain an optional extra that airlines can buy.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[DETROIT  A D-town gentleman accidentally busted a cap into his own foot early Tuesday morning while attempting to take out a cockroach, according to WDIV-TV. According to WDIV-TV, police said the 50-year-old man, who uses a wheelchair, was at his house on the block of 18700 Albion Street when he spotted the roach. So in an effort to kill the bug, he decided to throw his shoe at la cucaracha. Only problem is, Big Sean forgot he was strapped and had his revolver tucked in his shoe.  The piece fell out of the shoe and a round was discharged right into the guy's foot. According to the Detroit Free Press, police told them they could not confirm if the accidental non-fatal shooting was because of a bug, but said One-Shot-One-Kill was in stable condition after being taken to the hospital.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[HONG KONG  Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu is off prancing around in Hong Kong, Macau and other Chinese cities, but wasted zero time kowtowing to China and selling out Taiwan. According to the Taipei Times, on Friday afternoon, Han met with Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Han's office conveniently left the meeting off his published seven-day itinerary they released before the trip. But let's be clear this meeting was planned WELL in advance, as these things with Beijing always are. And when Beijing calls, good subordinates come running.   During his campaign, Han bragged he would strive for "100 percent economy, zero percent politics." This would appear to tip the political scale away from zero. It's very telling however that Han would make a special trip, head polished, tail tucked between his legs to the liaison office. What it shows everyone is the "one country, two systems" is nothing but a sad joke.]]></description>

According to the Potsdam main customs office, officials stopped the 69-year-old man on March 2, who had just arrived from Cairo, Egypt at Schönefeld Airport in Berlin.According to the Local, it appears the man wanted to leave the security area without declaring anything, but when customs officers shell-ected to look at his bag, they found something peculiar. Customs officials discovered what looked like a box of pastries, or that's what the box said at least. When officers asked the man what they were, he said it was chocolate. However, the authorities were shell shocked when they found three Moroccan tortoises inside instead. Since the animals are protected by the Convention on International Trade In Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, they were confiscated. The customs office said further investigations will be carried out by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation.]]></description>

      <title>China begins construction of floating nuclear power plants</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING    China is planning to build 20 floating nuclear power plants in the South China Sea, reports Asia Times. Chinese authorities have officially announced plans to start building the first floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea. These are designed to power surrounding artificial islands being built in the region.Floating nuclear power plants are offshore platforms containing small nuclear reactors built to power hard to reach islands or islets.Floating power stations are believed to be less prone to natural disasters because emergency situations such as a melting core can be cooled by pumping in seawater.  Roughly 20 floating nuclear stations could be built to power troops and residents in the  Spratly and Paracel islands. These regions are disputed between China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.Asia Times reports that the first floating nuclear reactor will be functional and sea-worthy by 2021. A prototype is currently being tested off the coast of China's Shandong province.According to Chinese state news agency, Xinhua Net, the first floating nuclear power platform would cost roughly US$2.1 billion.]]></description>

      <title>Greenland's fastest-melting glacier is growing again</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ILULISSAT, GREENLAND  A study has found that Greenland's fastest-thinning glacier is growing again, but scientists say that it may just be temporary.According to NASA JPL, the Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland has been thinning and retreating over the last 20 years.But research published in Nature Geoscience has found that since 2016, the glacier's melting has slowed.NASA reports that it also grew taller by 100 feet between 2016 and 2017.Researchers suspected that this was due to a climate pattern known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, which cools then warm the North Atlantic Ocean every five to 20 years. In 2016, the water temperature in Disko Bay cooled, reaching temperatures that were lower than in the late 1980s.The team used an ocean model to trace the cool water to a current that carries water around Greenland's southern tip, and northward along its west coast.The Associated Press reports that according to study co-author and NASA climate scientist Josh Willis, the findings indicate that glacier retreats and advances are much more sensitive to ocean temperatures than previously thought.  Temperatures are still rising slowly from global warming, and with over 90 percent of heat trapped by greenhouse gases going to the oceans, melting will be worse in the long run.]]></description>

      <title>NASA to send mini helicopter on Mars 2020 mission</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARS  NASA's Mars 2020 mission will include a mini helicopter that is set to be the first heavier-than-air vehicle to fly within the Red Planet's thin atmosphere.According to NASA, an autonomous rotorcraft called the Mars Helicopter will fly with the Mars Rover in 2020. The small helicopter will be carrying a camera to capture photos of the Martian surface for transmission back to Earth.The atmospheric pressure on the surface the rover is targeted to land on is equivalent to 100,000 feet above the surface of the Earth  over twice as high as any helicopter has reached.To generate enough lift, the Mars Helicopter's main body will be the size of a softball and weigh just four pounds.It will fly up to 15 feet off the surface using two sets of four-feet-long rotor blades spinning at 2,400 rotations per minute  ten times faster than any Earth helicopter.The Mars Helicopter will attempt up to five flights, each time flying a little farther and lasting up to 90 seconds.A solar array will recharge the lithium-ion batteries that will be used to rotate the blades and keep the vehicle warm through the frigid Martian night.Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory say that if the rotorcraft works as planned, future missions to Mars could deploy more helicopters to extend the reach of the landers they arrive on.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[HELSINKI  Finland's Data Protection Ombudsman is investigating HMD Global over claims that its Nokia 7 Plus phones sent user data to China.NRK reports that based on a tip from a phone owner, Nokia 7 Plus phones sent out unencrypted data, which includes location, sim card, and the phone's serial number.The data packages were sent to a server in China owned by China Telecom.According to Nokia, phones purchased in regions like the EU, U.S., and India send data for phone warranty and diagnostics to HMD Global servers in Singapore. Data from phones bought in China are sent to servers in China in order to comply with the country's Cyber Security Law.According to a statement from HMD Global, the Chinese device activation client was mistakenly installed on a single batch of Nokia 7 Plus phones that were meant for countries outside China.Reuters reports that the Finnish investigation would look into whether any data rules that involved personal information were breached and if there has been a legal justification for it.The company says no personally identifiable data was processed or shared to a third party, and claim the error was fixed in February by switching the client to the correct country variant.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Construction has begun on Danjiang Bridge, the world's longest, single-mast, asymmetric cable-stayed bridge.According to Zaha Hadid Architects, Taiwan's 920-meter long Danjiang bridge will span the mouth of the Tamsui river that flows through Taipei.The bridge will be supported by a slender 200-meter tall concrete mast, which is positioned so that it does not obstruct the waterway, or the scenic views. The single-mast design also minimizes disruption to the riverbed and local habitat.Archinect reports that the new crossing will reduce congestion on local roads as it links two major highways on opposite sides of the river. It is also set to improve connectivity with the Port of Taipei, and Taoyuan International Airport.Dedicated road, cycle, and pedestrian lanes will be built on the bridge. Also included are plans to  accommodate the future expansion of the Danhai Light Rail network.The Danjiang bridge construction project has a budget of $405.2 million. It will be constructed in 68 months and expected to open by 2024.]]></description>

      <title>Drunk driver flies 5 stories off highway in Taipei</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW TAIPEI CITY, TAIWAN  A man in Taipei got behind the wheel while under the influence, and ended up flying his car right off an expressway  to disastrous consequences. According to Apple Daily, the accident happened just before 7 a.m. on March 24. The driver, surnamed Chen, was on his way home after driving his girlfriend to work.While on the elevated No. 65 highway in New Taipei City, Chen lost control of his white SUV. The vehicle swerved and hit a street light pole before launching over the guardrail.It fell over five stories off the edge before crashing onto the embankment of a concrete skating rink in the park below.The 36-year-old was still breathing when rescuers pulled him out of the mangled wreckage. He was rushed to the hospital, but ultimately died.Blood drawn from the hospital later revealed that Chen had been driving while totally sloshed, with his blood alcohol at 1.2 milligrams per liter.

      <title>Prosecutors drop all charges against Empire's Jussie Smollet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  Prosecutors have dropped all charges against Empire actor, Jussie Smollett, who was accused of hiring two acquaintances to stage a racial attack against him, reports CNN. According to a statement issued by the Cook County State Attorney's Office, the 16 felony disorderly conduct charges against Smolley were dropped in exchange for Smollett carrying out 16 hours of community service and a $10,000 bond forfeiture to the City of Chicago.Joseph Magats, the lead prosecutor in this case, told CNN that Smollett was not a danger to the community, however, he did clarify that he did not believe Smollett was innocent.Chicago authorities are up in arms over the decision. Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel told CNN that the actor was using a hate crime to advance his own career, adding, "This is without a doubt a whitewash of justice and sends a clear message that if you're in a position of influence and power, you'll get treated one way. Other people will be treated another way."Chicago police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, also expressed his disappointment during a press conference on Tuesday saying, quote, "Do I think justice was served? No. What do I think justice is? I think this city is still owed an apology." Some politicians expressed concern over what kind of precedent this staged attack was setting. Current Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris took to Twitter to share a message of sadness and frustration following the announcement.  In it, she says that false police reports, "not only diverts resources away from serious investigations but makes it more difficult for other victims of crime to come forward."Not everyone is unhappy about the outcome. Many celebrities close to Smollett celebrated the decision in social media. Empire star, Taraji P. Henson, told USA today she was "happy that the truth has finally been set free."The official Twitter for the writers of Empire, simply tweeted a photo of a CNN TV report on Smollett with the caption, "see y'all Wednesday. #empire #empirefox"Smollett continues to declare his innocence, right before leaving court on Tuesday he told reporters, "I have been truthful and consistent on every ingle level since Day One."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[VANCOUVER   Looks like someone is a bit of an Apple aficionado, unfortunately that someone is Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who was busted last December in Vancouver on charges ranging from fraud to money laundering.   According to a court filing reported by Bloomberg, when Canadian po po arrested the Huawei executive at the behest of the U.S. on Dec. 1 during a stopover at Vancouver International Airport, they found her rocking an iPhone 7 Plus, an iPad Pro and a MacBook Air.Okay, she was carrying one sole Huawei product, the Mate 20 RS Porsche Edition.    According to Bloomberg, Meng's lawyers have filed an application seeking a copy of the data stored on the Apple products, oh yeah, and one Huawei device. They also requested the devices be sealed. In an email from Canada's justice department to Bloomberg, the crown prosecution consented and the devices will be transferred "to the British Columbia Supreme Court Registry pending an assessment of solicitor-client privilege."This isn't the first time Huawei employees have used iPhones. It demoted and cut the pay of two workers after the company's official New Year's greeting was sent out "via Twitter for iPhone."But Meng most likely will be okay, Huawei was founded by her billionaire father Ren Zhengfei. And on the bright side, it's easier to get Apple products into U.S. prisonsas long as you've got a good prison wallet.]]></description>

      <title>Pentagon conducts successful salvo missile defense test</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA  The U.S. military said it successfully tested a missile defense system to knock down an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile class target on Monday, according to Reuters.  The test was meant to simulate how well the U.S. could respond in the event of a missile threat from a country like North Korea or Iran. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency said two ground-based interceptor missiles were launched in the test. The first interceptor hit and destroyed the re-entry vehicle, and the other "looked at the resulting debris and remaining objects, and, not finding any other re-entry vehicles, selected the next 'most lethal object' it could identify, and struck that," it said. The dummy target was launched from the Reagan Test Site in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, more than 4,000 miles (6,400 km) from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, where the two interceptors were launched, the agency said. According to the Associated Press, the Pentagon is putting additional billions of dollars into expanding its arsenal of missile interceptors, which are based largely at Fort Greely in Alaska.]]></description>

      <title>Google 'Dragonfly' project continues in secrecy: Report</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA  Google is carrying out secret reviews of Dragonfly, a censored search engine designed for China, according to a report by The Intercept.Google's infamous Dragonfly project, a search engine designed specifically for the Chinese government, was met with intense backlash from human rights activists and Google's own privacy team who believed the project lacked transparency.In December 2018, Google announced that it had terminated all efforts to continue the project. However, a recent investigation suggests Dragonfly is far from being terminated.  A report by The Intercept states that Google is now carrying out a secret internal review of the project.Usually, Google projects are assessed by both peers and managers, however, a source told The Intercept that a closed committee of Google execs will be examining the project directly.Other sources told The Intercept that the reviews were likely being kept secret due to the controversy Dragonfly faced when information about the project was leaked back in August 2018. At the time, only 0.35 percent of Google employees knew about the project.After the project was exposed, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Google employees that from then on they would, quote, "definitely be transparent about Dragonfly as we get closer to actually having a plan of record. We definitely do plan to engage more and talk more."However, the project is still being kept secret from large portions of staff. An anonymous employee told The Intercept that Google was, quote, "holding any Dragonfly-specific documents out of employees' review tools, so that promotion is decided only by a committee that is read in on Dragonfly." In fact, Google employees had already suspected the project was still being developed. An Intercept report from March states that employees were carrying out independent investigations within the company.They found that code for Dragonfly had more than 400 new changes done in January and February this year, indicating that the project was still being developed. According to The Intercept, Google has not responded to requests for comments.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. slams Russia after military planes deployed to Venezuela</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CARACAS, VENEZUELA  The U.S. has accused Russia of meddling and aggravating political tensions in oil-rich but cash-strapped Venezuela.The Guardian reports that two Russian military planes, an Ilyushin Il-62 and an Antonov-124 cargo plane landed at Maiquetia airport near Caracas on Saturday. The two aircrafts were seen guarded by a contingent of Venezuelan national guardsmen.According to the BBC, Venezuelan journalist Javier Mayorca wrote on Twitter that 100 Russian troops disembarked with 35 tonnes of equipment.Russian military experts in the Guardian say the cargo plane may have been carrying spare parts. Venezuela was once one of the largest importers of Russian arms, and has warplanes, missiles, and other weapons in its arsenal that require maintenance.According to the Guardian, Russia is one of Venezuela's main allies, and has provided diplomatic, economic, and military support to the embattled regime of Nicolas Maduro.In December, Russia signaled its support for the oil-rich country by sending two TU-160 bombers to take part in a joint military exercise.The U.S. has repeatedly called for Maduro to resign, instead recognizing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's interim president.According to Reuters, the State Department condemned the Russian military deployment to Caracas, calling it a "reckless escalation of the situation."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also told his Russian counterpart in a phone call to stop its "unconstructive behavior," warning that the U.S. and its allies "will not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela."]]></description>

      <title>The worst ever US nuclear disaster explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MIDDLETOWN, PENNSYLVANIA  Forty years ago, a calm early morning in Middletown, Pennsylvania turned chaotic when a nuclear plant began leaking toxic fumes into the atmosphere. According to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, roughly 140,000 people were evacuated.Today we know this as Three Mile Island Accident and here is how it all went down. On March 28, 1979, The Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor, near Middletown, Pennsylvania partially melted down, releasing radioactive fumes into the atmosphere.According to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the plant experienced its first malfunction at 4 a.m. that same day on one of the two reactors on site.A mechanical break down was causing the reactor's cooling system to fail, which in turn caused pressure in its primary system to rise. In order to fight the increasing pressure, a valve located on top of the reactor's pressurizer opened.The valve was supposed to close once the pressure levels were stabilized, however, it jammed and stayed open. Staff did not know the valve had failed to close because instruments in the control room did not indicate otherwise. It wasn't until alarms began to ring that the staff realized the reactor was releasing coolants due to the open valve.The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission reports that roughly 2 million people were exposed to a small amount of radiation, which they claim cannot cause health issues.The reactor is now permanently shut down and 99 percent of its fuel has been removed.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of Defense shifted $1 billion to begin new wall construction along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to Reuters. According to the BBC, the funds are the first under the national emergency declared by President Trump to bypass Congress in order to fund his promised border wall. According to Reuters, the Pentagon chief said on Monday the money would go toward planning and building a 57-mile section of "pedestrian fencing," improved roads and lighting along the border. According to CNN, the Department of Defense authorized the Army Corp of Engineers to begin planning and construction for the project on Monday night. According to Reuters, acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said in a memo to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirsthen Nielsen that the Department of Defense had the authority to support counter-narcotics near international boundaries. Shanahan authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin planning and executing the project that involves building 57-miles of 18-foot-high fencing, constructing and improving roads, and installing lighting within the Yuma and El Paso sections of border.]]></description>

      <title>Head transplant doctors claim spinal cord progress</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HARBIN, CHINA  Surgeons from Italy and China claimed that two studies published Wednesday add evidence to their ability to treat irreversible spinal-cord injuries that will someday lead to the world's first human head transplant, according to USA Today. Sergio Canavero and Ren Xiaoping said new work they published in the journal Surgical Neurology International showed that monkeys and dogs were able to walk again after having their spinal cords "fully transected" during surgery and then put back together. The experimental procedures were conducted at Harbin Medical University in China and were supported by video evidence. The procedure involves applying a polyethylene glycol substance, or PEG, "to mend" severed or injured spinal cords.  Further research is needed on PEG in order to establish if it is ultimately able to help patients with spinal cord injuries and paralysis. Canavero and Ren have said previously that they want to use the technique with PEG as a basis for human head transplants. According to USA Today, most medical experts say attempting the procedure in humans would be a long shot.]]></description>

      <title>China has turned censorship into a business</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SHANDONG, CHINA  A Chinese online newspaper is profiting from online censorship services, reports Reuters. People.cn, China's online version of one of its biggest newspapers, is offering censorship as a product. According to Reuters, the website is helping companies monitor their content including websites, applications, music, and advertisements.The company uses a combination of human analysts and artificial intelligence to monitor content. Its AI platform uses machine learning to memorize new words that have been censored as well as government censorship rules. If there is data that the machine cannot categorize, it gets passed on to human analysts.Currently, they are providing services to Chinese news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, helping them detect and delete material that is not approved by the government. They also have a partnership with Liangziyun, a tech company that manages roughly 1,000 social media accounts.As of January, the company's net income has increased by 140 percent, that is equal to a net-profit of nearly $32 million.An independent researcher, named An, told Reuters that the censorship business will continue to grow, stating, 'with the development of 5G, the space and scale for the online content censorship market will only grow bigger and bigger.]]></description>

      <title>First direct look at super-Jupiter exoplanet reveals stormy skies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  Astronomers have made the first direct observation of an exoplanet using a technique known as optical interferometry.According to a press release from the European Southern Observatory or ESO, the exoplanet HR8799e was discovered in 2010, 129 light years from Earth in the Pegasus constellation.It is one of three planets orbiting around the star HR8799. CNN reports that the exoplanet lies closest to its host star, and takes 40 to 50 years to make a full orbit.Using the GRAVITY instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer, ESO scientists found that HR8799e is a 'super-Jupiter.' It is much more massive than any planet in our solar system, but also younger.Due to leftover energy from its formation and a powerful greenhouse effect, the temperature on HR8799e is an inhospitable 1,000 degrees Celsius or about 1,616 Fahrenheit.According to ESO, analysis showed that the exoplanet's atmosphere has more carbon monoxide than methane.Clouds of iron and silicate dust were also found, which when combined with the excess carbon monoxide, suggests a huge, violent storm in HR8799e's atmosphere.CNN reports that researchers are planning long-term follow up observations of HR8799e, and can study it more to learn more about the formation of planets and planetary systems.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists develop birth control earrings to prevent pregnancy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ATLANTA  Scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a novel form of birth control that's literally as simple as putting on an earring.A report published in the Journal of Controlled Release describes a technique that administers contraceptive hormones transdermally, via patches that can be mounted on earrings, necklaces, rings, or wristwatches.Contraceptive patches are already available, but the team believe incorporating them into jewelry could allow for a more attractive and discreet method of drug delivery.According to a press release from the Georgia Institute of Technology, researchers tested an earring patch that consisted of three layers.One layer is impermeable and contains an adhesive to hold it onto a piece of jewelry. The middle layer contains the contraceptive hormone in solid form, while the outer layer is a skin adhesive that allows the hormone to be transferred.Once it is in the skin, the contraceptive drug moves into the bloodstream and can then circulate through the body.The earring patches were tested on pigs' ears and the skin of hairless rats by being applied for sixteen hours and removed for 8.While drug levels dropped when the earrings were off, the patches were found to produce the necessary amounts of the hormone in the blood.The technology has yet to be tested on humans, but if ultimately used in the future, the patches would have be changed periodically, most likely on a weekly basis.]]></description>

      <title>Saudi Arabia using water from bone-dry California</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BLYTHE, CALIFORNIA  A Saudi Arabian food conglomerate is using Californian land and water for free through a century-old legal loop-hole, reports The Guardian.  Fondomonte Farms, a subsidiary from a Saudi Arabian food conglomerate called Almarai, owns 16 percent of the irrigated land in Blythe, California. They use this land to grow alfalfa which is then exported to Saudi Arabia as feed for the company's cows.Blythe is an arid region in California, however, its land is irrigated by the lower Colorado River. This river is also the main water supply for nearly 40 million people. Currently, the river is drying up due to climate change.According to The Guardian, Fondomonte Farms is using a loop-hole from a law dating back to the 1800s to benefit from the scarce water supply in the region for free. An 1877 water claim approved by the government allowed farmers and those living within the district to consume as much water as they needed for free due to the shortage of water in Blythe.The Palo Verde Irrigation District cannot sell the water in the area, they can only charge farmers $77 per acre-foot to cover the water district's overhead.  Apart from owning land in California, Almarai also owns 10,000 acres of land in Arizona that it bought back in 2014 as well as 30,000 acres in Argentina acquired in 2012.]]></description>
