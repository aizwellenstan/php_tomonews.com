      <title>Astronomers sights probable 'minimoon' orbiting Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TUCSON, ARIZONA  The Earth's busy orbit is occupied by space junk, nearly 5,000 artificial satellites, the Moon and now a possible temporary resident 'minimoon' called 2020 CD3. Live Science reports that the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory first spotted the captive space rock.Citing a NASA astronomer working with the university, the outlet reports that the space rock is 1.9 meters to 3.5 meters in diameter. Light reflection from the possible minimoon is consistent with carbon-rich asteroids. Other observatories have yet to confirm the sighting.It is not uncommon for Earth to capture temporary natural satellites, but most are too small to be detected. This minimoon has been orbiting our planet for close to three years and it is expected to leave in April to continue its journey around the Sun.Citing a study published in Arxiv.org, the outlet reports there is a possibility that the minimoon would be recaptured by the moon's gravity well and become a natural lunar satellite, which is a theoretical class of objects astronomers think might exist.]]></description>

      <title>New research center begins construction in Antarctica</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANTARCTICA  A British architectural firm has designed a research center called the Discovery Building for the British Arctic Survey research team in Antarctica.  Construction began on January 30, 2020.The building's exterior will be made with metal panels that are pale blue in color to prevent high ultraviolet rays from causing degradation to the structure, according to a press release from the architectural firm. The color is also a reference to the Antarctic sky.The Discovery Building will also have a wind deflector along its roofline that will be used to deflect cold air in the Antarctic so that the wind will travel down the structure's facade. This will help to minimize snow accumulation around the building.The structure also consists of a control tower from its roof. The tower will provide a 360Â° view of the area.The Discovery Building will also contain a medical facility, offices and recreational spaces among other facilities.The structure is expected to be completed in 2023.]]></description>

      <title>Doomsday Vault: Norwegian seed facility gets biggest ever deposit</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SVALBARD, NORWAY The Svalbard[f] Global Seed Vault is a repository that houses a collection of seeds from around the world in order to safeguard plant genealogy amid the growing threat of climate change.According to a press release from Crop Trust, the vault received a new deposit of seeds consisting of several hundred plant species on February 25 from different institutions around the world. This is said to be the largest deposit it has ever received.These contents include common staple crops, vegetables, herbs and even wild plant relatives.Global Seed Vault's website explains that it has previously received large varieties of rice, wheat and barley crops among others.The vault is located on the tectonically inactive Norwegian island of Spitsbergen.It has been constructed 130 meters above sea level in order to keep the seeds dry and to allow easy maintenance in the event of a power failure.]]></description>

      <title>China's Chang'e 4 reveals what's underneath the moon's far side</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOON  China's Chang'e 4 lunar mission has provided a glimpse into what lies beneath the far side of the moon.On January 3, 2019, the Chang'e 4 lunar probe landed on the floor of the Von Karman crater, on the moon's south pole. CNN reports that several hours after touchdown, the Chang'e 4 deployed the Yutu-2 to roam and explore the surface.According to a paper published in Science Advances, the rover used its Lunar Penetrating Radar to send radio signals to the lunar subsurface, up to a depth of 40 meters.Paper author Li Chunlai says this is three times the depth that the Chang'e 3, China's previous mission, was able to measure.After combining the radar image with tomographic data and quantitative analysis, researchers found that the subsurface was made primarily of highly porous, granular material, embedded with boulders of different sizes.According to CNN, this is likely due to the moon being frequently hit by meteors and other space debris during the early days of the solar system.When an object strikes the moon, the impact ejects a wave of material. The cratered surface becomes the top layer over time, with layers of boulder and fine debris buried beneath.Researchers say the findings could shed more light on the geological evolution of the moon's dark side. And as Yutu-2 continues to explore the area, the team is also looking into the possibility of returning samples to Earth.]]></description>

      <title>Russian police seize custom batmobile</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOSCOW  Police in Moscow have confiscated a batmobile replica over concerns that its not up to road safety standards.According to the BBC, the vehicle was a fully functional replica of the batmobile seen in the ridiculously bad 2016 film Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.  A statement from Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs says the custom batmobile was spotted in central Moscow and subsequently seized by police because it wasn't manufactured within factory conditions, and therefore not roadworthy.Officials say the vehicle's dimensions "exceeded applicable norms."The owner, a 32-year-old from Moscow, is now being investigated on three different charges: the batmobile's lack of documentation, its excessive weight and size, and the irregular features that aren't allowed on road-driven vehicles.There's no indication that the owner is trying to be a crime-fighting vigilante ala Batman, so maybe he's just a massive fan with a lot of cash to spare.]]></description>

      <title>Tokyo Olympics could be axed if coronavirus not controlled</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  In what would be considered a major blow, Dick Pound, senior IOC member, says the Tokyo Olympic Games could be canceled if the you-know-what's-it-19 isn't under control.The Guardian reports that according to senior member of the International Olympic Committee Dick Pound, an outright cancellation of the Games, instead of postponing or relocating would be likely if things aren't under control in a few months. The Summer Games are currently scheduled to be held on July 24. Pound, who has been an IOC member since 1978, thinks there's about a two- or three-month window before making a final decision. So this means they could probably wait till like, late May.   Dick told the AP, "In and around that time, I'd say folks are going to have to ask: 'Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo or not?" And let's be honest...who knows how well the rest of the world will be doing in a few months. As the Games get closer, Dick Pound said, "A lot of things have to start happening. You've got to start ramping up your security, your food, the Olympic Village, the hotels. The media folks will be in there, building their studios."Pound said, "you're probably looking at cancellation" if the IOC decides the games cannot go forward as planned in Tokyo.]]></description>

      <title>Kazuhisa Hashimoto, the inventor of the Konami code has died</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JAPAN  Kazuhisa Hashimoto, the inventor of the world-famous 'Konami Code' has died.You may not be familiar with him by name, but you'll likely know of him via his understated contribution to the gaming industry.Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A and then Start.It's a cheat code, rather, the "Konami code" and one that can be used in most Konami games.  According to Nintendolife, the rumour is, Hashimoto, a programmer and developer of the 1985 arcade shooter, Gradius, was actually struggling to beat the game. Hashimoto then invented the code to give himself back-door access and test the entire game. The best part? He accidentally left it in when the game went out on sale.Codes like this were initially used by developers to test out portions of a game or potential new pieces of code, but, of course, it didn't take long before players started finding out about them for themselves.Fearing the mass complications of removing it, Konami decided to actually leave the code or 'cheat' in the game. They eventually put the code in most of their games as the use of it by gamers became more popular.Cheats may not be such a big deal anymore, but they once were and to think, a simple hack created to make a person's job easier may have helped you complete a level or two and that's quite a cool legacy to leave behind.]]></description>

      <title>Superyacht designed using same technique as satellites in space</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NOORDWIJK, NETHERLANDS  Dutch shipyard Royal Huisman has designed the superyacht Sea Eagle II using the same engineering techniques typically reserved for space missions for the European Space Agency.The ship will be built in separate stages instead of the traditional approach in which ships are built from start to finish.The ship will be 81 meters long and will have three masted schooners, according to a news release from the ESA. Sea Eagle II will sport aluminum panels on its exterior. The panels will have holes and support structures added to them to cut down on construction time and accommodate features such as hatches for the yacht.According to a new release from European Space Agency dated February 27, the ship features a "desirable, luxurious interior."The superyacht is set to become the world's largest aluminum sailing ship once it is completed and delivered to its owners this spring.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese manufacturing hits record lows amid Wuhan virus</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  Some great news coming out of China amid the whole Wuhan virus debacle.Chinese manufacturing activity plummeted at a record rate in February, while the boys in Beijing were lying to the world about the extent of the coronavirus.According to the Beebs, the country's official manufacturing activity  the Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI)  dropped to 35.7 from 50 in January. This means the made in China virus is having a much bigger impact than the subprime mortgage crisis that rocked the financial world in 2008.    The BBC reports that the data also hints that factories are having a hard time finding enough workers.And since China makes up a third of global manufacturing and is the world's biggest exporter, this PMI drop will have an effect on other countries. According to the BBC, companies like Apple, Diageo, Jaguar Land Rover and Volkswagen have all been affected. Many companies rely on China's 300 million migrant workers, a third of which are still under quarantine. Bloomberg Economics reports that Chinese factories are operating at 60 percent to 70 percent of capacity this week.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WARSAW, POLAND   Aleksandra Sadowska, a 25-year-old from Wroclaw, Poland and devoted follower of famous rapper 'Popek' decided to copy him by getting the whites of her eyes dyed black.After the eye-watering procedure, she began complaining of sharp pain in her eyeballs, according to her, the tattooist said it was normal and could be treated with painkillers.Despite taking the advice, Aleksandra has since tragically lost the sight in her right eye and been warned the irreparable damage will soon claim the vision in her left eye too.During an investigation, it emerged the tattooist from Warsaw, known as 'Piotr A' made a number of serious errors, including using ink made for use on skin, which should never come into contact with the eyes.The tattooist, who still runs his salon where he carries out mainly ear piercings, has now been charged, four years after Aleksandra's ordeal began. If sentenced, he could face three years in prison for unintentionally severely disabling the woman.How did he plea? Not guilty.Incredibly, however, she's not letting it defeat her, saying, "I will not lock myself in the basement and get depressed. I have sadness behind me but I live on."]]></description>

      <title>Snickers compare the Welsh language to keyboard bashing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.K.  Chocolate bar brand, Snickers has caused outrage after comparing the Welsh language, 'to someone sitting on a keyboard.' The company's account wrote a thread of posts with possible Welsh place-names under the question, "A place in Wales  or someone sat on a keyboard?"It listed places like the village of 'Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch' which has the second-longest official single-word place name in the world.The other contenders were, 'Rhosllanerchrugog' and 'Penmaenmawr' which are both real places in North Wales.Netizens threatened Snickers with lifetime boycotts and some called racism. Some netizens were puzzled by the ferocity of the pile-on, with one saying, "Seriously?! I'm Welsh and not offended by this at all! When were jokes banned?"Snickers, which is made by American conglomerate Mars, has since apologized. The company's social media team said they are "hugely and wholeheartedly thankful" to their Welsh fans in the UK and all over the world and "promise not to let ill-informed tweets ruin this relationship any further".]]></description>

      <title>U.S. orders China fake news to cut U.S. staff in America by 40%</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The Trump administration has ordered four Chinese state-owned fake news media outlets to trim their Chinese staff in the U.S. by about 40 percent.  Bloomberg reports that measures are seen as a response to Beijing's restrictions on American reporters including the booting of three Wall Street Journal writers last month. According to two State Department officials talking to Bloomberg, starting on March 13, the four fake outlets will be allowed to have a combined 100 Chinese citizens in the U.S., down from around 160 now. Too bad that's still 100 too many Chinese spies for each Chinese state speakerbox. The pretend news outlets affected are Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International and China Daily Distribution Corp. A fifth, Hai Tian Development USA, is also included in the cap, but they only have two Chinese employees on its U.S. payroll. So who are all these sellout Americans working for Hai Tian?According to another senior administration official, the U.S. also plans to limit how long Chinese citizens are allowed to stay in the country on journalist visas. That would match a Chinese requirement restricting foreign reporters to as little as 30 days before they must seek an extension.]]></description>

      <title>Covid-19 symptoms and precautions explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WORLD  Here's a list of symptoms of the virus and precautions people can take in order to better protect themselves as the novel coronavirus continues to spread around the world. Initial symptoms of the coronavirus diseases, or Covid-19, include fever followed by a dry cough, according to BBC News. Patients suffering from Covid-19 could develop shortness of breath after a week. This may lead some to be hospitalized for further treatment.The BBC noted that symptoms are similar to those of common viruses such as the cold or the flu.The World Health Organization states that the incubation period for coronavirus diseases lasts up to 14 days. The incubation period may be longer and could last up to 24 days, BBC News reports, citing researchers. It's unclear how exactly the virus that causes Covid-19 spreads, though similar viruses are typically spread through droplets that are produced when a person who has contracted the virus sneezes or coughs.The United Kingdom's National Health Service advised the public to wash hands frequently with soap or use hand sanitizer, sneeze or cough into a tissue or into your sleeve and avoid touching the face with unwashed hands.In more severe cases, Covid-19 could lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, organ failure or even death.The virus, which is officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, originated in China. It has since spread to 60 countries, with especially severe outbreaks in Italy, Iran and South Korea.]]></description>

      <title>DNA found in 75 million year-old dinosaur bones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA / BEIJING, CHINA  Researchers have discovered DNA inside 75 million-year-old dinosaur fossils,  according to the National Science Review.According to the Science China Press writing on Phys.org, scientists from the U.S. and China made the discovery while investigating skull fragments of Hypacrosaurus nestlings. In addition to DNA, researchers also found proteins, chromosomes and cartilage cells among the fossils.According to the British Natural History Museum, these dinosaurs were herbivores and lived 70 million years ago in Canada and the USA during the Late Cretaceous period.Researchers suggest that their findings could mean that DNA can exist longer than currently thought and may, in fact, be preserved in fossils that are millions of years old.

      <title>Sleeping man trapped by car crashing into his bedroom</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA  A man was asleep in his bed when a car outside swerved off the road, knocked down a utility pole, drove through two front yards and came to a crashing stop through his bedroom wall at 1 a.m.The incident on Saturday the 29th of February saw the man pinned between the vehicle and a wall of his house and had to be rescued by firefighters.As he was trapped between a car and a hard place, he had to be removed with the 'jaws of life'.Fortunately, the man avoided serious injuries and went to the hospital in minor condition.Speaking to the Southern California News Group, Fire Department Battalion Chief Bruce Vanderhorst said, "He got very lucky." The Police arrested a 22-year-old man, on suspicion of DUI, while the passenger was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication; both escaped injury, but not the law. The fire department said that four people were living in the destroyed house, which was rendered uninhabitable. According to their report, the total damage cost was a huge $200,000. That'll wake anyone up.]]></description>

      <title>Astronomers spot biggest space explosion since the Big Bang</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Astronomers say they caught a glimpse of the biggest explosion in the cosmos ever observed by x-ray and radio telescopes. The huge eruption occurred in the Ophiuchus cluster, a constellation of galaxies 390 light years distant from Earth in the Virgo Cluster.According to the paper that will be published in The Astrophysics Journal, a supermassive black hole in the core of the cluster's central galaxy had expelled matter and energy so violently that it smashed a vast hole in the surrounding gas.The black hole created jets that accelerated electrons to nearly the speed of light, which resulted in radio waves that filled the cavity left in the eruption's wake.BBC reports astronomers first noticed something strange with the cluster's central galaxy when NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory telescope in 2016 saw the unusual curve of its edge. A second science team later used the data from radio telescopes to confirm that a black hole had blasted the cavity into existence by tracking the radio plasma in the gap.The study's lead author Simona Giacintucci at the Naval Research Laboratory is cited by MIT Technology Review as saying the cavity is so large that 15 Milky Way galaxies could fit inside its volume in a row.According to co-author Professor Melanie Johnston-Hollitt at the Murchison Widefield Array, the gap is so vast that light traveling across its distance from one end will not reach the other for 1.5 million years.]]></description>

      <title>Galactic collision may be bending our galaxy out of shape</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PARIS  The European Space Agency's space observatory Gaia may have found an explanation for the warped shape of the Milky Way Galaxy, which is bent into an S shape. This warp rotates with the galaxy's stars instead of standing still.A study published in Nature Astronomy says that an ongoing collision with another galaxy, most likely the dwarf satellite galaxy Sagittarius, has disrupted the dish shape of our galaxy.The European Space Agency launched Gaia in 2013 to render a 3D map of the Milky Way.The agency says the survey will eventually take a spatial census of 1 billion stars in our galaxy, or 1 percent of its constituents. Citing the authors, the European Space Agency says that Gaia mapped out the motions, velocity and distance of our galaxy's stars. The researchers then worked backward to determine when and how collisions with Sagittarius deformed our galactic dish.]]></description>

      <title>How airlines are sanitizing planes amid the coronavirus outbreak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WORLD  As the novel coronavirus spreads globally, major airlines are taking preventative measures to ensure their airplanes are as clean as possible.Southwest Airlines told CNN Travel that their airlines' cleaning procedure includes disinfecting all hard surfaces inside the cabin as well as cleaning all seats and the carpet amid the outbreak of Covid-19.An American Airlines spokesperson told the broadcasting network that airplane lavatories and floors are being thoroughly cleaned while all visible trash on seat pockets is removed before every flight.A Qantas Airways spokesperson explained that their cabins, seats, galleys and washrooms are being cleaned and disinfected. The spokesperson also noted that their planes use HEPA filters as part of their air-conditioning systems. The airline says the filters "provide much cleaner air than other public spaces" such as trains or shopping centers.Delta Air Lines says it is using a technique called fogging, which involves spraying an EPA-registered disinfectant on all trans-Pacific flights landing in the U.S. The airline says it plans to expand fogging to more inbound international flights.Cathay Pacific is replacing all seat covers and disinfecting all surfaces and carpets as well as sterilizing water equipment and replacing air filters, CNN reports. The airline has also stopped providing hot towels, pillows, blankets, magazines and duty-free service on all flights to and from China.]]></description>

      <title>Shoving a potato up the poop shoot won't cure hemorrhoids</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  When your backdoor is burning from a bad case of piles, what do you do when there's no Preparation H laying around? Home remedies of course. According to Vice, the UK edition of Reader's Digest decided to write up a list of nine home remedies for treating hemorrhoids. Some ideas the magazine suggests include nestling a warm teabag right against your backdoor while sitting on the can. Then there's also slathering on some Vicks Vaporub around the outside of your bum orifice.Apparently, grating up a raw potato and holding it against your rear entrance also works. You know one thing that doesn't work? Shoving an entire frozen potato wedge up the backside like WalesOnline suggests. According to the website, inserting a frozen potato slice into the poop shoot for 30 seconds several times of three to five days will clear those piles right up. It's pretty clear from the article that whomever wrote it, isn't a medical professional. Meanwhile, actual doctors are telling people not to do it. So who are you going to trust? WalesOnline or some know-it-all-doctor?]]></description>

      <title>Cat to be deported over coronavirus fears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHENNAI, INDIA  Hysteria over that-which-must-not-be-named has struck again and this time it involves an unlucky stowaway pussy cat, India Today reports.According to the Khaleej Times, the feline in question arrived in Chennai port around 3 weeks ago inside a shipping container from China and has been held there on fears it has been infected. Citing PETA India, the Khaleej Times reports that the organization has told the port that cats cannot transmit or contract that which must not be named. But, according to India Today, Chennai port quarantine has decided to send the cat back to whence it came after detaining it for over 20 days.  But did it really come from China? And is it really the wisest decision to send it back there? PETA India doesn't seem to think so. India Today reports that Chennai-bound ships often stop in Singapore and Sri Lanka. And PETA India says that in China, cats are often killed for their meat and fur. The organization has offered to help find the cat a fur-ever home after quarantine and other checks have been completed.]]></description>

      <title>Innovative bridge built vertically, unfolds like an umbrella</title>
      <description><![CDATA[VIENNA  Researchers have demonstrated a futuristic bridge-building technique that allows the structure to unfold like an umbrella to the length of its span. This new technique is cost-effective, time-saving and has less impact on the natural landscape, according to a news release from Vienna University of Technology.The Lafnitz Bridge in Austria was built vertically instead of horizontally with scaffolding, like traditional bridges.Using this technique, engineers erected two vertical concrete piers and attached steel girders on both sides. As the piers are then slowly lowered using hydraulic systems, the steel girders unfold.Once the bridge has opened up to reach a horizontal position, concrete is added to the structure.The 116-meter Lafnitz Bridge was "unfolded" over the Lafnitz River on February 27, 2020.Johann Kollegger, a professor at the Vienna University of Technology, explained in the news release that traditional bridges erected using scaffolding can take months to be completed.Using this new technique, the elements for the lowering method can be set up in two to three days while the lowering process itself takes roughly three hours.Kollegger noted that the technique could be used to build bridges in difficult terrain or "terrain that should be not disturbed," such as nature reserves.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists are making a black hole based quantum teleporter</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PASADENA, CALIFORNIA  Scientists have proposed to build a functional wormhole tunnel by simulating quantum entangled black holes in a lab. Quanta Magazine reports the linked black holes are theoretically able to teleport quantum information via the tunnel.Black holes were thought to totally obliterate the objects they consume. However, the experiment will test a new idea in physics that evaporating black holes actually send information about subsumed objects back to the universe via Hawking radiation.Citing California Institute of Technology physicist Sepehr Nezami, the outlet reports the research team believes a black hole could be forced to disgorge intact information after it is entangled with another black hole on a quantum level.Stanford University's Adam Brown is cited as saying quantum circuitry could make a functional analog for entangled black holes. If the theory is correct, this circuitry would be able to instantly transmit and decrypt qubits, also known as quantum teleportation.]]></description>

      <title>Tito's Vodka asks you to stop using their vodka to make hand sanitizer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  Amid the shortage of hand sanitizers, Tito's Vodka, or 'America's Original Craft Vodka' is being used as a substitute, but the company wants you to stop. They took to Twitter today to urge people to stop using its product to make their own hand sanitizer after several people on the platform have referenced a misinformed recipe that surfaced online. The formula claims that vodka can be mixed with aloe vera gel and essential oils to make homemade hand sanitizer.The Texas-based company wants you to know, as does common sense, that, "per the CDC, hand sanitizer needs to contain at least 60% alcohol. Tito's Handmade Vodka is 40% alcohol, and therefore does not meet the current recommendation of the CDC."A Tito's spokesperson spoke to The Daily Beast saying, "while it would be good for business for our fans to use massive quantities of Tito's for hand sanitizer, it would be a shame to waste the good stuff, especially if it doesn't sanitize."]]></description>

      <title>Inflatable latex pants for dudes may be the next big fashion trend</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  If you're one of those people who has been waiting for the concept of truck nuts to be translated into high fashion, your day has finally arrived.According to VT,  for his London College of Fashion graduate collection, menswear designer Harikrishnan came up with the idea to make men's inflatable latex pants.The amazing pants were strutting their stuff out on the catwalk earlier this month. The extremely bulbous pants are made up of 30 separate latex panels; either solid white or in strips of red and green. In a recent interview with Dezeen, he said he got the idea, "when I was playing with my dog and I started thinking about how exaggerated objects must look like from such a low angle. The thought of him seeing me as a giant figure or not seeing my head at all was intriguing, so I decided to reimagine the people around me through the game of distortion."He also added, "In fashion, I see the same images and similar proportions everywhere. I want to create visual imagery that's as far away as possible from neutrality, to make people question the relevance of the proportions we see every day."They still kind of look like truck nuts in pant form.]]></description>

      <title>1.5 billion-year-old Earth was a 'Waterworld'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO   New evidence from Iowa State University and the University of Colorado suggests that 1.5 billion years ago, the planet was covered by a vast ocean and had no continents.Published in Nature Geoscience, the research examined more than 100 ancient samples of seafloor, located now in the outback of northwestern Australia. Its rocky scenery of craggy seafloor preserves a hydrothermal system dating back 3.2 billion years.Lead study author, Benjamin Johnson told Live Science that when the Earth was 1.5 billion years old, the ocean had high levels of isotope oxygen-18.Their computer models showed that continental landmasses leach oxygen-18 from the oceans, but in the ancient samples, he observed an abundance of it. So, in the absence of continents, the oceans would carry more oxygen-18, which implies a "Waterworld."The continents appeared later, as plate tectonics drove enormous, rocky landmasses upward to breach the sea surfaces. The prospect of an ancient Waterworld Earth also offers a new perspective on another intriguing question: where the planet's earliest forms of life appeared and how they evolved.Questions the team hopes to answer.]]></description>

      <title>NASA will be unable to command Voyager 2  for almost one year</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA  Starting early this month, Voyager 2 will stop receiving commands from NASA, the space agency announced in a news release on March 5.This is because the transmitter that sends commands to Voyager 2, the DSS43 radio antenna near Canberra, Australia, will undergo "critical upgrades" over the next 11 months.As Voyager 2 travels in space, the radio antenna won't be able to send commands to the space probe while it is being updated. The spacecraft is currently flying in a downward direction relative to our planet's orbital plane, which means it can only be in contact with the radio antenna site in Australia.During this time, the Voyager team will put the spacecraft into a state of inactivity, which will still allow the spacecraft to send back scientific data to the team during the next 11 months.NASA said in the news release that the radio antenna's transmitters and other parts need to be replaced and upgraded as they are 40 years old and are "increasingly unreliable."The DSS43 antenna is part of the U.S. space agency's deep space network, which is used to communicate and receive information from faraway spacecraft.NASA said the upgrades will also benefit future space missions such as the Artemis lunar missions and Mars 2020 rover mission.The upgrades on the DSS43 radio antenna are expected to be complete by January of 2021.]]></description>

      <title>Explainer: How the COVID-19 virus invades human cells</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Researchers from China have used cryo-electron microscopy to show how SARS-CoV-2 infects humans. The study published in Science says the virus targets a type of receptor found on human cells in the lungs, heart, kidneys and intestines.A previous study published in Science found the virus' spike protein has two receptor binding domains, or RBDs, facing downward and another facing upward. These allow the virus to bind with and invade human cells.According to the new study, the virus targets a human ACE2 receptor that has bonded with an amino acid transporter. This subtype of ACE2 structure has never been discovered before.The virus uses the spike protein's 'up' RBD to bind with the ACE2 structure, which enables the virus to enter and infect the cell. According to the researchers, their discovery may help in developing a cure or vaccine that prevents infection by targeting ACE2.]]></description>

      <title>Ultra-rare Nintendo PlayStation sells for $300,000</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S.   The ultra-rare prototype 'Nintendo PlayStation', which was rediscovered in an attic in 2015, has sold at auction for $300,000.  The console was initially constructed as part of a doomed collaboration between Japanese juggernauts, Sony and Nintendo. The project came to an end when Nintendo suddenly announced a partnership with Sony rival, Philips; which led Sony to make the PlayStation One. Around 200 prototypes for the Nintendo PlayStation are believed to have been made, but most were eventually scrapped, and only one is publicly known to still exist.According to Eurogamer, the functioning Nintendo PlayStation toured the world but was eventually put up for auction last month through Heritage Auctions. The bidding process came to an end on the 6th of March with the final bid reaching $300,000.Despite wanting to keep his identity secret at first, 51-year-old real estate and tech entrepreneur, Greg McLemore had been identified as the buyer. McLemore is most notable for founding Toys.com and Pets.com. McLemore told Forbes, "I'm looking to not have this machine just buried in a closet somewhere." He said that he wants to take his collectionwhich he estimates includes over 800 coin-operated machines and countless other smaller games, trade magazines and original artand build a permanent museum.]]></description>

      <title>Airlines are wasting thousands of gallons of fuel on 'ghost flights'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EUROPE  Airlines are wasting thousands of gallons of jet fuel flying EMPTY airplanes amid China's latest gift to the world because of some fantastic European rule saying operators can lose their flight slots if they're not flying. Business Insider reports that people around the world are saying no thanks to air travel as the China Sniffles-19 has spread like wildfire around the globe According to Business Insider, European nanny rules demand that airlines flying out of Europe must continue to run 80 percent of their assigned slots or risk losing them to competitors. The Times of London reports that this has led to some airlines flying completely empty  "ghost flights" to and from Europe.Clearly, destroying the environment for business is probably the best way to go. And luckily jet fuel grows on trees, so we'll always have more to burn. According to the failing New York Times, the airline industry has been one of the harder hit industries among the recent Co-China-19 madness with some estimates saying worldwide revenue to fall $63 billion to $113 billion for the year. Our thoughts and prayers go out to airlines across the world during these trying times. Stay strong guys.]]></description>

      <title>Curiosity rover spots potential clue for life on early Mars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW ROCHELLE, NEW YORK  In a study published in Astrobiology, astrobiologists at Washington State University and Technische Universitat in Berlin, say NASA's Curiosity rover found organic compounds called thiophenes in soil samples that may have been produced by bacteria.The rover's instruments break down larger molecules and scientists can only examine chemical fragments. This means they cannot rule out a non-biological origin for the thiophenes, according to a press release from Washington State University.On Earth, thiophenes are found in coal, crude oil and white truffles.A thiophene molecule has four carbon atoms and a sulfur atom that make up a ring. Carbon and sulfur are essential elements to living organisms. The thiophene could be non-biological or bacterial in origin, but the evidence is not conclusive for either case.The study's authors say that bacteria may have existed when Mars was hotter and wetter three billion years ago. Some of those bacteria may have played a role in the sulfate reduction that transforms sulfur to thiophenes.]]></description>

      <title>Great Barrier Reef may soon face dangerous bleaching period</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOWNSVILLE, AUSTRALIA  Hot weather over the coming weeks could see the Great Barrier Reef enter a period of dangerous coral bleaching, reports Vice.com.Citing international marine experts, Phys.org reports that Australia's Great Barrier Reef might soon face another period of severe coral bleaching if the warmer than average March weather continues to heat the reef. The last time that happened large swathes of corals were wiped out.For scale, the GBR is around the same size as Japan. Vice reports that between 2016 and 2017 half of all corals died in Australia's Great Barrier Reef following a series of heatwaves.  According to National Geographic, 30 percent died in 2016, and a further 20 percent perished in 2017 due to heat stress.The coming weeks will be a "critical time" for the reef, explained David Wachenfield, Chief Scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), in a weekly update on the reef's health posted to GBPRMPA YouTube channel.]]></description>

      <title>Soccer legend Ronaldinho in jail for using fake passport</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ASUNCION, PARAGUAY  Brazilian soccer legend Ronaldinho has been labeled, "stupid" by his lawyer after being banged up for using a fake passport.His bizarre and brazen comment came during an interview with a Brazilian newspaper, saying "the courts have not taken into account the fact that Ronaldinho didn't know he was committing a crime, because he didn't understand he had been given false documents. He is stupid."The 39-year-old Samba star and tiki-taka legend, along with his brother Roberto were hauled to court after being arrested at the Sheraton Hotel in Asuncion on Friday.While Ronaldinho's lawyer appeals a decision not to allow the star to be placed in house arrest, the first photos of him in prison appeared on social media still sporting his trademark grin.And Blas Vera, the head of the Paraguayan jail, told Reuters, "In broad terms, he is doing very well. I see he is in good spirits, just like you see him on television, always smiling."The footy star known for his tricks on the pitch, along with his brother, are claiming they're the ones who were tricked. His lawyer has said Ronaldinho had been given his Paraguayan passport as a "gift" by a businessman, assumed it was an "honorary-type" document of no real value and gave it to an official without thinking when he reached Paraguay because it was the "first thing he got out of his bag."This Brazilian businessman who is alleged to have handed over the passports and two women believed to be the rightful owners of the travel documents are now also in custody.Interestingly, Ronaldinho did actually have his Brazilian passport confiscated after he was convicted alongside his brother of building an illegal fishing platform on a lake in a conservation area, but Paraguayan prosecutors confirmed earlier this week that it had been returned to himSo why didn't he use his own passport when entering Paraguay? Twinned with his lawyer's comments about it being the "first thing" he laid his hands on, this situation is being greeted with a mixture of ridicule and disbelief.]]></description>

      <title>China says it will soon have no new Wuhan virus cases</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  With numbers of Co-China-19 cases supposedly declining in the lovely Middle Kingdom, Chinese health officials are using the opportunity to make some highly questionable predictions. According to the SCMP, a senior Chinese researcher, who is a part of a 14-member team sent from Beijing to Hubei province, claims that there will be no more new Wuhan virus cases in China by the end of March.Well...no new cases as long as you don't count the new cases that pop up in Hubei provinceyou know, the epicenter of this latest global Panda-demic.  Zhang told fake China news outlet the People's Daily, "We have analyzed the infections trend. So far, the daily infections in places other than Hubei have almost gone down to zero since February." "According to our analysis of the statistics, we expect cities other than Wuhan in Hubei province will be basically free of coronavirus patients in the middle of March. The hope is that Wuhan won't have daily new cases in late March." Good thing "hope" has been proven to be an effective cure against the China-Cough-19. Zhang then went on to say people in other parts of China might be able to ditch their masks in April, but that did not mean that the Wuhan virus would be completely gone and there could still be cases, including people arriving from overseas. See what he did there at the end? China is now trying to spin this by saying people are bringing the Wuhan virus into the country. Hey China...there's a reason it's called the Wuhan virus.]]></description>

      <title>How the coronavirus spread in the U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE    The spread of the Wuhan coronavirus has medical authorities around the world scrambling to develop efficient ways to detect and contain the pandemic.Health officials in U.S. have learned that despite doing "everything right" the virus is so contagious that it has managed to go under the radar. This is how the virus entered and spread in U.S.According to Bloomberg, Patient Zero arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport from Wuhan, China on January 15. During his time there he took public transportation at the airport.On January 19, he checked himself into a clinic after experiencing a fever and cough. He was admitted, tested for the virus and sent home to self-quarantine. Results of the test came back positive the next day and Patient Zero was then admitted into a special biocontainment ward at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington. This unit was originally developed for the Ebola virus. By February 21, Patient Zero had fully recovered. However, an infected individual or individuals went undetected. Health experts researching the spread in Seattle believe that it was in the four-day window of time from January 15 to 19 that Patient Zero may have infected more people. Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Bloomberg that according to his estimates, for every dozen cases American officials caught, 20 to 25 went undetected. The lack of efficient testing kits and testing criteria also exacerbated the spread of the novel coronavirus. Early testing kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were working well. However, by mid-February, testing results were coming back inconclusive due to manufacturing issues.Faulty testing criteria also affected early and efficient detection. Early on, only patients with mild symptoms who had come in contact with a potentially infected person or had traveled to Wuhan themselves. This means that individuals who did not fit these criteria who carried the coronavirus were not tested.]]></description>

      <title>Comet annihilated ancient human village, research suggests</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ABU HURERYA, SYRIA  Impact from a comet around 12,800 years ago is believed to have wiped out a human settlement, according to new research published in Scientific Reports.  The study suggests that meltglass samples found at the Abu Hureyra site in Syria could be evidence that a comet destroyed the area.  The high-energy and intense heat needed to create the molten glass material could only have resulted from a cosmic impact, suggests study author and University of California Santa Barbara, Geology Professor James Kennet. He says those sorts of temperatures could melt a car in less than 60 seconds.The findings back a theory known as the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. This suggests that debris from a disintegrating comet entering Earth's atmosphere struck areas in the Americas, the Middle East and Europe some 12,800 years ago.Kennet says that the settlement at Abu Hureyra would have been "abruptly destroyed" by such an event.Thumbnail image via University of California, Santa Barbara.]]></description>

      <title>Wuhan residents: "It's all fake!"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WUHAN, CHINA  The devoted minds of the Chinese government have attempted to shift the narrative to both sweep under the carpet their lackluster response to the cough-19  and to convince its people that King Xi Jinping has somehow single-handedly steered this huge struggle in the right direction.However, in a rare shift, the people of China, specifically the people of Wuhan have demonstrated something completely unexpected, they ain't buying it.  Videos have surfaced that appear to show Wuhan residents shout "everything is fake!" at Communist China's Vice Premier, Sun Chunlan, as she toured the sectioned-off community at the hub of the outbreak last week on the 5th. In the videos that quickly surfaced online, residents can be heard shouting in both the Wuhan dialect and Mandarin, "Fake! Fake! Fake!" and, "Everything is fake!"They can also be heard shouting, "They are taking advantage of the people to put on a show."This open criticism of the Chinese government is almost unheard of and shows signs of a telling people that have had enough of its government's lies and continued coverups. But, even more surprisingly, in an exceptionally unusual move by the regime, China's state-controlled media such as the Global Times and the People's Daily shared short clips of the now-viral incident.They had made out that they would investigate the situation and ensure a "level of satisfaction by the general public."But, as one Twitter user mentioned, the broadcast edited the videos to make it seem as though there was only one voice, rather than the truth.Could it be that the communist government's rare turn of events of showing the video is actually being set-up to use Sun as a scapegoat? Only time will tell.]]></description>

      <title>POLICE CHASE: Man can't stop because "bird in the back"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SURREY, U.K.   A businessman who fled police in his Rolls-Royce claimed he could not stop because a woman was performing a sex act on him.57-year-old Businessman Maurice 'Fred' Sines, who owns a string of lucrative caravan parks, took police on a pursuit back in May 2018, from a PGA golf tournament through the exclusive Wentworth Estate. Guildford Crown Court heard that there had been complaints about his behavior earlier in the day and police had arrived at the tournament to see him leaving.The Daily Mail report that the police began to pursue him when they spotted his car driving erratically. During the pursuit, his $500,000 Phantom drove on the wrong side of the road, went the wrong way around a roundabout, hit speeds of 96kmph in a 40kmph, and narrowly avoided a head-on crash.The pursuit came to an end when officers experienced problems with their radios, shortly after, they found his car abandoned nearby. When officers finally caught up with him he confessed he was in the car but it was being driven by a chauffeur who he had ordered not to stop because he had "a bird in the back", and claimed he didn't want to be caught because he had recently gotten back with his wife.However, CCTV showed that Sines was actually in the car alone; the story was fabricated, he had refused to stop because he was driving while banned.Yesterday on the 10th of March at Guildford Crown Court, Sines was not only handed a suspended sentence but also slapped with a two-year driving ban, a three-month tagged curfew, ordered to pay a $6,500 penalty and $5,400 in court costs.He said, "I saw a police car and I panicked. I regret what I've done."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WUHAN, CHINA  With cases of the Co-Sniffles-19 supposedly declining in fantastic China, Chinese dictator Xi Jinping has pumped the propaganda machine into overdrive. In a highly choreographed visit to the epicenter of the world's latest troubles, emperor Xi made his first visit to Wuhan since the Chinese viral outbreak started more than two months ago.  According to China's fake news outlet Xinhua, Xi "went straight to Huoshenshan Hospital" after touching down in Wuhan were he "visited patients" and "sent regards" to medical workers, "encouraging them to firm up confidence in defeating the epidemic."Actually...Xi didn't have the gonads to see them in person. He talked to them over video in a conference room that was nowhere near the actual makeshift hospitals. What a brave leader. Xi then toured a Wuhan neighborhood with quarantined residents who have been stuck inside for weeks. But because last week Wuhan residents heckled Vice Premier Sun Chunlan while she was visiting one neighborhood, police were deployed in people's apartments so that Xi wouldn't be welcomed by any shouting residents. China claims new cases of Chinese people being infected with the Wuhan virus have plummeted. And since China has been nothing but transparent and open about all the actual cases and deaths the world can now breathe a big sigh of reliefright?]]></description>

      <title>Taiwanese kids fight Wuhan virus with a lego robot</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KAOHSIUNG, TAIWAN  With just 81 miles between them and China, Taiwan, a country of 23 million people has managed to curb the epidemic and of March 10th, some four months later, the country has just 48 cases of Covid-19. With everyone pulling in the same direction, it should be no surprise then to see students at an elementary school in Kaohsiung fighting the disease in their own unique way, and in this case, an automated disinfectant dispenser built from Legos. Kids from the ages of six to 12 use every chance they can to get in line and use their self-built disinfectant robot. What's more, the student-built bot cheers, "washing hands is super!" after it senses a pair of hands in front of its ultrasonic sensor. Beside their disinfecting bot, are scenes crafted by the younger students showing various situations that require hand washing: an operating table, a toilet, and even a flower garden.Teachers at the school in Linyuan, which is situated in an industrial area, decided that after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, students should know the basic principles of robotics; that way, they could help solve problems in the future such as air pollution and gas explosions.Unsurprisingly, the school has represented Taiwan in many international competitions and won several prizes. Tackling this pandemic starts with all of us.]]></description>

      <title>Churches removing healing holy water amid Wuhan virus outbreak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOLY LAND  Oh lordCatholic churches around the world are getting rid of communal holy water and shutting down holy sites amid the recent China-Cough-19 panda-demic. According to God Daily Dot, the pools of the shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes in France have been closed to the public. The spot is popular for believers who think bathing in the "healing waters" cure sicknessgod, that's ironic.HuffPost reports that Catholic churches in the U.S. are draining holy water fonts. The fonts are used for Catholics to bless themselves as they enter church.   These are just some of the measures being taken by bishops in Miami, Seattle and Chicago to slow the spread of the Wuhan virus. According to HuffPost, some bishops are also banning the distribution of consecrated wine through a common cup. Some bishops have also begun to remind priests and deacons that they can switch up how the host, aka sacramental bread, is offered to churchgoers. According to HuffPo, priests and lay ministers are being reminded to wash their hands like they have OCD before and after mass, and have hand sanitizer for those distributing Communion. Don't worry guys...you have God on your side. That is, unless he's down with the Wuhan too.]]></description>

      <title>Molten IRON RAIN discovered on massive exoplanet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GENEVA  Scientists have found evidence of molten iron rain driven by extreme heat on an exoplanet 640 lightyears from Earth, according to new research.Exoplanet WASP-76b is found in the Gemini constellation where its close orbit to a star causes extreme temperatures on one side of the planet, while the other side is cooler.According to Physics World, the conditions are hot enough to break down molecules into atoms on the side exposed to the star. On the darker side these can recombine into molecules.The exoplanet orbits the star differently to how Earth orbits the Sun. Earth rotates as it circles the sun. The exoplanet does not. The Guardian reports that, similar to Earth's moon, the exoplanet is "tidally locked". This means that only one side of the planet is continually exposed to the star, while the other is locked in darkness. It's these conditions that are believed to create the exoplanet's extreme weather conditions and iron rain.]]></description>

      <title>Wuhan delivers pork rations in trash trucks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GANDU, WUHAN, CHINA  On Wednesday the 11th of March at around 8 p.m, a garbage truck was used to transport pork meat to local residents in Gandu, Wuhan as part of a committee's scheme to deliver rations to its people.Unfortunately, before the unsanitized method of transportation was noticed by the community, the truck that was delivering 1,000 pieces of pork had already delivered 530. Local residents were left appalled by the committee's choice of logistics, with some claiming the meat even smelt bad. The committee soon sent out an apology message via its official Weibo account and organized staff to apologize to the local residents and collect and "destroy" the pork that had already been distributed. The committee promised to deliver the same quantity of pork for the following day, however, this time in a sanitary way that complies with the "strict food safety requirements" that they chose to ignore. The local government in Qingshan that governs Gandu, decided to fire both the secretary and vice-chair of the local committee after being left red-faced for what they call a "professional error."]]></description>

      <title>Turtles think ocean plastic smells like food, study finds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA  New evidence suggests that sea turtles are drawn to the smell of plastic debris found in the ocean, according to a report published in Current Biology.The research team conducted experiments on 15 five-month-old captive loggerhead turtles.They placed each of the turtles into an isolated container where they would be exposed to the odor of four different items in random order: turtle food, clean plastic debris, deionized water, and plastic that was purposely exposed to a marine environment for five weeks so it would become coated with marine microbes.The turtles were given roughly one minute inside the container before being exposed to the odor of the items. The airborne particles were supplied into the container through a pipe and a fan outside of the isolated tank for two minutes. Researchers observed the turtles' behavior for four minutes after being exposed to the odors.Results showed that turtles were attracted by the scent of turtle food and bio-fouled plastic equally. When exposed to these two items, turtles kept their nares above the water three times longer than they did when exposed to clean plastics and deionized water.Co-author of the study Joseph Pfaller of the University of Florida, Gainesville told the BBC that it's not so much that the plastics look like turtle food but that quote, 'anything out there can grow bacteria and animals on it that turtles want to eat and so it smells to them like something they should go check out and possibly consume, which can lead to their death.'"According to 2015 data published in the journal Science, between 4.8 and 12.7 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year.]]></description>

      <title>Plastic-eating caterpillars could help tackle pollution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MANITOBA, CANADA  In 2017, small caterpillars were found to be dining on plastic garbage. According to CNN, the little caterpillars can munch through plastic, even polyethylene, a common and non-biodegradable plastic found pretty much all over the planet now filling up landfills and oceans around the world. According to findings published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, scientists now understand how the grubs are able to eat the plastic.Apparently it's because of its amazing gut bacteria or microbiome. Associate professor and chair of biology at Brandon University in Canada Christophe LeMoine said, "We found that waxworm caterpillars are endowed with gut microbes that are essential in the plastic biodegradation process.""This process seems reliant on a synergy between the caterpillars and their gut bacteria to accelerate polyethylene degradation."LeMoine did add that the waxworms were not an immediate fix to the world's horrible plastic garbage problem, and that more work still needs to be done to unlock how the caterpillars and their microbiome work together before it can be adapted and replicated on a large scale. Well, in the meantime...just keep tossing everything into the garbage or the oceans.]]></description>

      <title>Dude breaks out of prison using makeshift dummy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SUDBURY, UNITED KINGDOM  A violent UK prisoner is back behind bars after fleeing prison using a makeshift dummy, Birmingham Live reports.Prisoner Luke Harvey inmate managed to dupe his guards with the dummy one Friday night last August. He was doing 12 years for armed robbery but was due for release this year.Birmingham Live reports that prisoner Harvey then scaled a 3m fence at Sudbury prison. On the other side his girlfriend, Hannah Smith, was waiting for him in a getaway car. The two are then said to have gone to Skegness for the weekend.Harvey told Hannah he was due back at prison on Monday. But, Derbyshire Live reports that he went on the lam for six days by himself before getting a ride from Hannah to Birmingham. And that's when the law caught up with them.Harvey was sentenced in 2014 to 12 years but would've been released this year. He got another 10 months added to his sentence. Meanwhile, Hannah, a mother of one, got six months and community service.

      <title>Explainer: How the Wuhan virus infects human cells</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Researchers from China have used cryo-electron microscopy to show how SARS-CoV-2 infects humans. The study published in Science says the virus targets a type of receptor found on human cells in the lungs, heart, kidneys and intestines.Citing Kingston University microbiologist Mark Fielder, Sky News reports that the virus seems to attack two types of lung cells: goblet cells that coat the respiratory tract with mucus, and ciliated cells that usually filter out pathogens.A previous study published in Science found the virus' spike protein has two receptor binding domains, or RBDs, facing downward and another facing upward. These allow the virus to bind with and invade human cells.According to the new study, the virus targets a human ACE2 receptor that has bonded with an amino acid transporter. This subtype of ACE2 structure has never been discovered before.The virus uses the spike protein's 'up' RBD to penetrate the cell. The virus then dissolves its own protein shell and releases its RNA payload inside the cell, according to the British Society for Immunology.A study in Frontiers in Microbiology says a coronavirus hijacks the cell's structure to reproduce. The viral RNA takes over the host cell's endoplasmic reticulum to replicate itself and to manufacture the protein parts to make new viruses."According to the Society for Immunology, the hijacked cell's Golgi bodies then package viral RNA and proteins in a viral protein shell. This leads to the creation of new viruses that leave the infected cell via the membrane.The study in Frontiers in Microbiology says coronavirus takeover imposes stress on the host cell. Cell death, or apoptosis, is the result when the infection overwhelms the host cell's ability to maintain homeostasis.]]></description>

      <title>Researchers blame toxic additive for vaping related lung injuries</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DUBLIN  Medical researchers from Ireland have linked vitamin E acetate to vaping illness. According to new research published in PANAS, the substance is commonly found in illegal THC-based vaping cartridges.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland's research team says in a news release that heating the normally harmless substance through vaping produces ketene, a highly toxic gas.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sounded the alarm on vaping illness after detecting a rash of lung injury cases that appear to be related to e-cigarette use that began in August 2019.The researchers say ketene can cause severe lung damage up to 24 hours after exposure. Citing doctors at the Mayo Clinic, the New York Times reports the lung injuries of vaping illness patients resembled those of industrial accident-related chemical burns.According to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, vitamin E acetate was in the lung liquid samples taken from 48 out of 51 cases of vaping illness, or close to 94 percent.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEPAL  Anyone feel like climbing Mount Everest? Unfortunatelyyou may have to wait awhile.BBC reports that Mount Everest has been closed for the rest of the expedition season as the Chinese coronavirus wreaks havoc across the world. Nepal's government said it would be canceling all climbing permits from March 14 till April 30. China had already axed expeditions from the northern, Chinese-controlled, side of the mountain. The Kathmandu Post reports that Nepal earns $4 million a year by issuing Everest climbing permits, in addition to other tourism revenue. According to the Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office Narayan Prasad Bidari, "As of now, all issued permits and permits yet to be issued for the 2020 Everest season will be cancelled."According to the BBC, most climbers come from the US, India, China, UK, Japan and South Korea.

      <title>COVID-19 can survive on some surfaces for up to three days</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  New research by American health officials and experts published in medRxiv shows that the novel coronavirus can survive in air particles for several hours and on some surfaces for up to three days.Researchers used a nebulizer machine to spread the coronavirus in the air and on several surfaces in a controlled environment. The device was used to emulate how the coronavirus would disperse if an infected individual coughed. Results showed that the virus was still detectable in the air three hours after it was spread.It was also detectable on copper surfaces for up to four hours, on cardboard surfaces for up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to two to three days.An important side note is that this new evidence does not confirm that people have been infected through air particles but that it is plausible that the virus could spread through aerosol and surface contamination.So what can you do? Sanitize your hands regularly, don't touch your face, watch out for symptoms in yourself and others and mainly DO NOT PANIC. That ain't going to help anyone.]]></description>

      <title>Futuristic green house allows residents to grow crops indoors</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI  An architectural firm based in Shanghai has unveiled a futuristic, zero-waste house that allows residents to power their own homes and grow their own produce in a living space of 150 square meters. Yang Design's Green Concept House features solar panels and wind turbines that would be used to provide power to the house. Spare energy from electricity consumption would then be used to convert water vapor from the air into water drops using condensation panels on the roof of the house.Circular incubators present throughout the green house would allow residents to grow plants and vegetables indoors. Water drops created from the condensation panels would be deposited to a circular pool which would regulate water flow to each circular incubator.This system would be connected via a smartphone app, allowing residents to monitor their in-home garden using the app even if they are away from home. The app would alert homeowners with an alarm if one of the plants is in need of specific care or send out a notification if a vegetable or a plant is ready to be picked.The architectural firm explained on its website that this futuristic design could create a new means of communication between separated individuals and allow them to bond over the vegetable garden as well as redefine the concept of agriculture.]]></description>

      <title>Fast moo-ving cow on the loose, wanted by police</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PEMBROKE PINES, FLORIDA  A deceptively fast moo-ving cow is on the loose in sunny Florida, which police have been trying weeks to catch.According to the Associated Press, the Pembroke Pines Police Department on Wednesday said the heifer was seen near Interstate 75 in southern Broward County. Apparently it's been on the lam since late January. The police tweeted out a photo titled "Wanted Unknown Cow" with the caption, "Description: Female cow. Brown with a white head. Faster than it looks. Talented fence jumper. Enjoys pool." Sounds kind of like a Tinder profile.Police spokeswoman Amanda Conwell said cops and wranglers have not been able to catch the animal and have backed off when it gets too close to roads with a lot of traffic. Authorities also say the cow is guilty of "MOOving violations, uddering false checks, and fleeing and eluding police."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WORLD  The coronavirus has officially taken over the world and information about how the virus works, spreads and affects humans seems to be changing by the minute. Here is what we know so far.According to a report by the Associated Press, the coronavirus spreads when a healthy individual breathes in respiratory droplets that are expelled by infected individuals.Research by American health officials and experts published in medRxiv shows that the novel coronavirus can survive in air particles for three hours.It was also detectable on copper surfaces for up to four hours, on cardboard surfaces for up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to two to three days.An individual carrying the virus can infect around two to three other people, making it more contagious than the flu. However, coronavirus spreads less easily than measles and tuberculosis.Early symptoms include a fever, a dry cough and difficulty breathing. Recovery takes about two weeks.People carrying the virus seem to be the most contagious a few days before showing symptoms. Older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions are at higher risk of experiencing more severe symptoms of the virus.]]></description>

      <title>Israel fighting coronavirus with cell phone data</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JERUSALEM  Israel plans to combat the coronavirus outbreak via the cyber-monitoring of its citizens, according to Reuters. The New York Times reports the country will monitor cell phones to track people with COVID-19 and those who have come into close contact with them. The Israeli government will comb through the geolocation data gathered from the country's telecommunications providers to pinpoint those affected.This will then be used to track the history of the infected person's movements and to identify potentially infected individuals. Once identified, those suspected of catching the virus will receive a message telling them to self isolate immediately.According to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, there are 324 cases of the virus in Israel, 41 in Palestine and none in the Gaza Strip.]]></description>

      <title>Explainer: What is a virus?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A virus is made of nucleic acids surrounded by a protein shell. There are many types of viruses; some like the coronavirus have RNA-based genetic material, while others contain a DNA-based genome. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, viruses straddle the definition of being living and nonliving. This is because viruses can only move or reproduce by infecting living cells, according to a study published in PubMed Central.The PubMed study explains the human immune system can fight off viruses by deploying B-cells. These white blood cells produce antibodies that eradicate viruses before they get into cells.The British Society of Immunology reports that another way the immune system fights viruses is to send killer T-cells to search and destroy infected cells. Since the immune response is attacking the body itself, it also causes stress to the patient.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon seller who stockpiled 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE  Matt Colvin, an Amazon seller from Tennessee bought 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer, ready to exploit and profit from a pandemic. After the first fatality of the Coronavirus in the U.S, Matt's brother, Noah drove 1,300 miles across Tennessee and Kentucky, filling a U-Haul truck with thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer and anti-bacterial wipes. Meanwhile, Matt prepared for pallets of even more wipes and sanitizer and started listing them on Amazon, where he sold 300 bottles immediately for between $8 and $70, saying, "it was crazy money."The next day, Amazon kicked his items off the shelf and warned others too, 'if you keep running up prices, you'll lose your accounts.' eBay soon followed in tow and enforced even stricter rules, banning any U.S. sales of masks or sanitizer. Mr. Colvin is now sitting on a stash he can't shift, and people like Mikeala Kozlowski, a nurse in Massachusetts, have been searching for hand sanitizer since before she gave birth to her first child; now she says she can't buy any in-store and could only find them listed on Amazon for around $50. He says, "It's been a huge amount of whiplash. From being in a situation where what I've got coming and going could potentially put my family in a really good place financially to 'What the heck am I going to do with all of this?'"Amazon said, "Price gouging is a clear violation of our policies, unethical, and in some areas, illegal. In addition to terminating these third party accounts, we welcome the opportunity to work directly with state attorneys general to prosecute bad actors."According to The Times, Tennessee has a price-gouging law that bars people from charging "unreasonable prices for essential goods and services, including gasoline, in direct response to a disaster."On Saturday, after The New York Times published this story, the Tennessee attorney general's office said it had sent investigators to Mr. Colvin's home, given him a cease-and-desist letter and was now investigating his case.Of course, Mr. Colvin does not believe he was price gouging, despite the fact he charged $20 on Amazon for two bottles of Purell that retail for $1 each. Mr. Colvin has since stated he was exploring ways to donate all of his supplies.]]></description>

Usually, the famous deer of Nara are kept properly fed by the hordes of tourists. Unfortunately, the Wuhan Virus has killed all of that. The dramatic drop in people visiting Nara have caused the deer to leave to park in search of food. Several TV news reports have shown deer sightings at unfamiliar spots around the city. Residents report that deer have been devouring shrubs and flowers on the sidewalks. Hopefully things will get back to normal soon.

      <title>Microfibers found to change fish' reproductive, respiratory systems</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA  A new study from Duke University has found that microplastic fibers can cause damage to the respiratory and reproductive systems of the Japanese medaka fish.For the study, researchers placed 27 pairs of the fish in a water tank with large amounts of suspended microplastic fibers.On a weekly basis, scientists monitored egg production, weight and the amount of fiber that was ingested and excreted out by the medaka fish.After 21 days, researchers examined the tissue of the Japanese medaka fish and found that those exposed to larger amounts of microplastic fibers had developed fused membranes and increased mucus production in their gills. The microfibers had also caused damage to the epithelial cells lining the fish gills. Female fish exposed to the microfibers had been found to produce more eggs over this period of time.The study also found that microplastic fibers residing in fish guts may release harmful chemical coatings that could leak into the bloodstream of the fish.Melissa Chernick, a researcher involved with the study, explained in a Duke University news release from March 16 that if wild fish swimming in the ocean damage their gills, it would make the fish less competitive while looking for food and less able to guard against potential predators in the sea.]]></description>

      <title>Rival monkey gangs wage street war over banana</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOP BURI, THAILAND  Rival monkey gangs fought a bitter street battle over a banana last week in Lop Buri Thailand, according to the Chiang Rai Times.Citing a video posted to Twitter, the Thai outlet reports that monkeys can be seen fighting each other and chasing one who appears to have a banana. According to the Bangkok Post, Lop Buri is home to two rival simian gangs, the temple monkeys and city monkeys. Each faction has their own turf.The Chiang Rai Times reports that a slump in tourism to the popular temple area has led to a lack of food for the local monkey population who are usually fed by holidaygoers.That, in turn, may have drove to the mass monkey brawl seen on social media last week.According to Thai news site Khaosodo English, the monkeys are mostly fed high-sugar and fatty human foods.  All that junk food, the website reports, even led to one becoming obese.

      <title>Woman's grim method for staying healthy not backed by Doctors</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AYLESBURY, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, U.K.  Health blogger, Tracy Kiss is encouraging people to consume semen in a bid to stay healthy during the Coronavirus pandemic.  She claims she ingests her boyfriend's product every day, either "directly" or in a smoothie. The personal trainer has also been applying his semen on her skin for the past three years, which she dubs "nature's multivitamin." The blogger believes it's overflowing with vitamin C, calcium and magnesium.The mum-of-two from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said, "the purity of it is just wonderful. It's nature's multivitamin, and it's there, it's natural, it's free. It's everything you need in one daily dose."She also added, "there were times when my family didn't want to give me a kiss on the cheek."Dr. Sarah Javis said she was, "extremely worried" when she heard this as she says, "the idea of drinking semen doesn't have the slightest nugget of science behind it and is frankly, extremely worrying."But Tracy stands by it, in fact, she used to use her best friend's 'product' as a face mask to treat her rosacea, that was, of course, until she met her boyfriend.Dr. Sarah Jarvis wants people to know that this is a myth, along with all the other "nonsense" out there regarding home remedies to keep you sanitized. She says, "there are clear ways you can protect yourself and they are the messages we are giving out constantly" i.e. wash your hands. TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>How coronavirus symptoms progress from day to day</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WUHAN, CHINA  Chinese scientists have identified a pattern of day-to-day symptoms typical of patients with coronavirus in a new study.The study, published in the journal JAMA, looked at 138 patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Fever is typically the first symptom experienced by those infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, according to the study of patients in Wuhan. Some COVID-19 patients may also experience fatigue, muscle pain and a dry cough.By day five, this transitions into breathing difficulties, especially for the elderly or those with preexisting health conditions. The study found it took patients an average of seven days after running a fever before they were admitted to a hospital.By day eight, those with severe symptoms had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, which can be fatal. This is when fluid builds up in the lungs.Patients with worsening symptoms are typically admitted to the intensive care unit by day 10. These patients are probably experiencing more abdominal pain and loss of appetite than those with milder symptoms.On average, it took patients with COVID-19 roughly two and a half weeks to recover from the illness and be discharged from the hospital.According to CNN, as of March 19 there were 215,000 coronavirus cases globally. The death toll has surpassed 8,000.Countries such as Argentina, Canada and Taiwan as well as the European Union have shut their borders in order to slow the spread of the disease.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  A U.S. volunteer became the first person to receive an experimental COVID-19 vaccine as part of the first phase of humans trial on March 16, the Associated Press reports.According to Kaiser Permanente, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health to conduct the project, the vaccine eschews dead or inert viruses and instead utilizes messenger RNA, or mRNA.A previous study in Molecular Theory suggests engineered mRNA could cause ribosomes in human cells to manufacture artificially designed proteins.According to Kaiser Permanente, their vaccine would make cells produce a protein that is found in the outer coating of SARS-CoV-2, which triggers an immune response.If a person who received the vaccine is later infected with COVID-19, their prior immune response may help their body mount a stronger reaction to the real virus infection.]]></description>

      <title>China announces it's booting American journalists</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  China's feelings have been hurt once again, so now it has decided to boot US reporters working for the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. According to the New York Times, the Chinese have also demanded that those outlets, in addition to the Voice of America and Time magazine, give the Chinese government detailed information about their operations. That's easythey report the news, something that is non-existent in fabulous China.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the announcement after the Trump administration limited to 100 the number of Chinese citizens working in the U.S. for five fake Chinese news outlets that produce nothing but good old fashioned CCP propaganda. The ministry said US journalists, whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020, must notify Chinese authorities within four days and hand back their press passes within 10 days. The statement also said, "They will not be able to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China," including Hong Kong and Macau. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the move "unfortunate" and said he hoped Beijing would reconsider. What the U.S. should do is just shut down Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and The People's Daily and ship all their workers back to China.They'll have much more fun reporting on the real news going on in China.]]></description>

      <title>Man reserves 1,873 seats at baseball games for privacy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OSAKA, JAPAN  Here's a question. What would be the best way to watch your favorite sports team? A Japanese man says reserve nearly 2000 seats and then cancel them so you get yourself some serious privacy. Kiyoshi Shibamura, a 41-year-old fan of the Orix Buffaloes baseball club from the Japanese city of Osaka, came up with an ingenious-yet-costly plan to watch his favorite team compete against the SoftBank Hawks on the 28th and 29th of September last year. The allure of spectating his boys in privacy prompted the devotee to create 1,873 fake names and then reserve a seat for each fabricated person. He then canceled all but his own reservation right before the end of the reservation period, making sure that no one else managed to sit anywhere near him. Heard of the Orix Buffaloes? Probably not, as it has one of the smallest fan bases in Japan, so having 1,873 empty seats is probably not a big deal, right? Wrong! You see, this was no ordinary game, this was one of the last games of the season and the SoftBank Hawks would go on to win last year's national title, so the stakes were pretty damn high and so were ticket prices.The ingenious reservation stunt cost the team 10.86 million yen, roughly $105,000, a considerable sum for such a small team. Unsurprisingly, an internal investigation was launched and it wasn't that hard to discover the culprit, considering he was the only person sat in the empty patch of 1,873 chairs, that and he didn't deny it. "I wanted to watch the game comfortably with no people around. I wanted to stand out on TV."It's unclear whether Shibamura is facing only a fine or actual jail time.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Korean man tries to disinfect his cash by microwaving it</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA  The internet is currently swamped with ill-informed homemade kits and methods on how to eliminate the coronavirus from our lives, but what about money? What method are people taking to clean their cash?One man in Busan, South Korea gathered up a total of 39 10,000-won notes, roughly $328, stuffed them into his microwave, and switched it on; unsurprisingly his cash burnt. He took his browned cash into the bank asking for help, in the end, 33 notes were salvageable meaning he only lost $50. This isn't the first time though that someone has attempted to clean their money using a microwave, a Chinese woman in Jiangsu province tried the very same, only this time upped the risk and put $449 in the microwave.]]></description>

      <title>Mercury's scorching heat may help the planet form ice</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ATLANTA  Mercury's close orbit around the sun and extreme heat may have helped the planet to generate ice. Writing in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, scientists say solar wind may contribute to a chemical process that forms ice in Mercury's poles.While much of Mercury is very hot, the planet lacks an atmosphere to dissipate the heat. According to Space.com, this allows pockets of cold to exist in the shadows of polar craters, which preserve the ice that exists on Mercury.In a news release from Georgia Institute of Technology, researchers say Mercury's soil contains hydroxyl [e]groups, or bonded hydrogen and oxygen. After solar winds bombard the substance to 400 degrees Celsius, the oxygen and hydrogen break free to form water.The scientists say that according to their model, some of the water molecules would break down into their constituent atoms, but the remainder would escape and land on Mercury's poles. This creates ice deposits in the craters.]]></description>

      <title>Trump signs $1B bill to replace Huawei equipment</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump signed a bill into law last Thursday that will fork over $1 billion to help small telecom providers get rid of all their Huawei and ZTE Chinese garbage. AP reports that the U.S. government considers the Chinese companies a security risk because of their close ties to the CCP. Both companies have denied that China uses their junk for spying. Good thing China and Chinese companies have a great track record when it comes to telling the truth. According to the AP, the FCC has already voted to bar U.S. phone companies from using government subsidies to buy Huawei and ZTE contraptions. This bill will mostly affect small, rural companies because the major U.S. network providers don't use Chinese equipment. The law creates a reimbursement program that small telecom providers can use when tossing out made in China spy crap. In a statement the White House said, "The administration will not risk subjecting  America's critical telecommunications infrastructure to companies that are controlled by authoritarian governments or foreign adversaries."]]></description>

      <title>Woman licks freezer handle to protest against coronavirus</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARSHFIELD, WISCONSIN  A Marshfield Wisconsin woman was caught licking the door handle of a freezer at a supermarket in what she says was a protest to the coronavirus. Seems like the #coronaviruschallenge isn't just something attention-hungry millennials and Gen Z kids are doing.It's not just toilet seats and door handles that are being licked. According to a police report by the Marshfield Police Department, it appears that grocery store freezer door handles are also victims of human insanity.According to the report, the store manager at a Festival Foods in Marshfield, Wisconsin was going about his day, sanitizing the door handles of freezers in the store  you know doing his part in fighting a global pandemic  when he spotted an odd woman in the section.The store manager told police the woman, who was later identified as 53-year-old Nona Lindhorst, was staring him down and then, get this, proceeded to lean over and lick the handle of one of the freezer doors.Of course, cops got involved, and when questioned by the police, the woman said that she had done it in protest to the coronavirus. Yes, you heard that right.Do we really have to say it people? Don't go around licking toilet seats, door knobs, freezer door handles â¦ or anything for that matter. What part of global pandemic do people not get?!Luckily, the woman told police she hadn't 'protested' anywhere else. Police told her her behavior was quote 'uncalled for.' You think?]]></description>

      <title>Japan's space probe fires shell at asteroid to study its composition</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  Launched in late 2012, Japan's spacecraft Hayabusa2 was sent to investigate asteroid Ryugu by lobbing a copper shell into the space rock. Japan's space agency JAXA published the probe's findings in the journal Science on March 19.According to JAXA, the Hayabusa is 0.6m across the front, 0.4m from prow to stern, and has four ion thrusters. The spacecraft is equipped with X- and Ka-band antennas for communication and its sensors include optics, LIDAR and spectrometers.According to the study, the Small Carry-on Impactor shell blasted a semicircular crater 14m wide and 0.6m deep, with the shock apparently absorbed by boulders. This confirms that Ruygu is indeed a rubble-pile, or boulders loosely held together by sandy materials.The impact experiment suggests the most ancient materials of the asteroid are up to 4.6 billion years old, but the substance coalesced with other asteroids' remains only 10 million years ago to form Ryugu.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ASUNCION, PARAGUAY  Despite Ronaldinho being told he faces spending six months behind bars, the tiki-taka legend is celebrating his 40th with a huge BBQ in his Paraguayan jail along with a slice of modest cake. It comes after he helped some inmates win a 16kg pig with five goals in a prison football tournament.According to Paraguayan newspaper Hoy, the Ballon d'Or winner was convinced to join in as he watched the match unfold while talking to a prison guard.The star unsurprisingly showcased his class, scoring five and getting six assists. Locked up but certainly not forgotten, Ronaldinho also received birthday messages from fellow Brazil 2002 World Cup winners, Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos.43-year-old, Ronaldo posted a photo of himself with Ronaldinho with the caption, "Congratulations, may you overcome this difficult stage of your life with the same joy as always!"46-year-old Carlos said, "Best wishes friend." Surprisingly, the cherished star has so far been snubbed by former club Barcelona, as they used their social media channels to send best wishes out to current stars Antoine Griezmann and Jordi Alba, who were also born on March 21.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Costco will not take back your hoarded TP or bottled water</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MURICA  Now that Americans have hoarded enough toilet paper and bottle water to last until the end of humanity, Costco has announced that it won't let you return these items.  According to Today, signs are starting to pop up at several Costco locations saying that they will not be accepting returns for high-demand things like toilet paper, bottled water and sanitizing wipes. Today reports that several Instagram accounts that follow Costco news, but not affiliated with the company, have posted different signs at many locations listing items that can not be returned. Some of the lists include products like, toilet paper, paper towels, sanitizing wipes, water, rice and Lysol. Today says it's unclear if this is a company-wide policy, or one that has been started by stores in individual locations. Empty shelves have been seen across the country as panic buying has gone viral due to the spread of the Xi Jinping Virus-19.]]></description>

      <title>Quarantined citizen disguised as T-Rex stopped by Police</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MURCIA, SPAIN  Spanish police were prompted to post a video online, along with a statement to remind citizens to stay indoors after an unidentified citizen was caught roaming the streets disguised in a T-Rex costume. It comes after Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro SÃ¡nchez imposed a 15-day state of emergency that has restricted free movement besides essential trips. And while walking pets is still allowed, the police did note on social media that dinosaurs are not included under this exemption. Officers did not provide details of why the resident was sporting a dinosaur outfit, or who they were. However, many commenters suggested that it may have been the unidentified person's attempt to shield themselves from the virus.Murcia Police also wrote, "remember that you can go outside during the ESSENTIAL TIME so that our pet meets his needs and do not forget to collect their droppings."Do not use your pet as an excuse to break the rules."The tweets offer some light-hearted relief in the country, which has so far seen nearly 18,000 cases and 831 deaths.The metrics suggest that Spain is currently the fourth worst-hit nation in the world after China, Iran, and Italy.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

These are cosmic events when day and night and equal in length. Hawas' assertion goes against modern archaeological thinking.Research from 2018 suggests that its construction also may relate to the autumn equinox.

      <title>Comet ATLAS might become the  brightest to grace the sky in years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Comet ATLAS, also known as C/2019 Y4, is growing brighter at a surprising rate as it hurtles toward the Sun. Space.com reports that as of March 17, the newly discovered comet's magnitude, a measure of its brightness, was +8.5, 600 times brighter than forecasts. It may well become the brightest comet in years.Comets are made of dust, frozen water, ammonia, methane and carbon dioxide. Citing Karl Battams of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Space Weather Archive reports ATLAS is shedding huge amounts of gas and it may yet disintegrate before reaching the Sun.The comet ATLAS is named after the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, a pair of observatories in Hawaii that first discovered the comet on Dec. 18, 2019.Space Weather Archive reports ATLAS began heating up two months before reaching the Perihelion, or the nearest approach to the Sun. Should it withstand the sun's heat, the comet will loop inside Mercury's orbit and become visible to the naked eye on Earth in April.]]></description>

      <title>American celeb in Taiwan flouts coronavirus protocol</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Seems like stardom can really get to your head and make it so big you forget that you could be spreading a virus that's responsible for a global pandemic.American chef-turned-celebrity, Eddie Huang, (mainly known for writing the book behind the ABC family sitcom, Fresh Off the Boat) is in hot water for not following a 14-day quarantine after his arrival in Taiwan.According to Apple Daily, Eddie flew from Los Angeles to Taiwan on March 14, potentially escaping the coronavirus mess that's ensuing in America.That exact same day though, Taiwanese officials declared California a level two alert region, meaning all people coming into Taiwan from there need to self-quarantine   Hollywood peeps included.So what did Eddie do? He left LAX with a huge facemask on but proceeded to post a photo of him out and about Taipei without a mask, potentially taking the virus with him into bougie cafes and restaurants.Eddie was swiftly called out by locals on social media with some asking him to "please set an example" for others.That post was strangely not on his Insta timeline a while after the kerfuffle, huh, weird.In his defense, Eddie says that Taiwanese officials took his temperature and wrote down his home address but they did not require him to self-quarantine because he left California when it was at a level one alert.But level one, two, three or one thousand aside, Eddie is a public figure in a country that is highly respectful of public and personal hygiene so, why not take responsibility and show some respect for how things are done on this side of the world? Instead of deleting the post that got him in trouble?If you're wondering why Taiwanese people are taking this so seriously, just look at the COVID-19 stats here.Taiwan has managed to contain the virus (without having to resort to a lockdown) as much as possible through a combination of quick and organized response from medical authorities and of course, citizen responsibility.So, yeah.

      <title>500-year-old well-preserved body dug up in Anhui, China</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HUAINING, ANHUI, CHINA  After spending the last five centuries buried deep beneath the earth, a man's corpse was dug up in Huaining county in Anhui province. The unsuspecting villagers unearthed the man's coffin while leveling off some ground; inside was a body that certainly does not look a half-millennia dead.As residents trampled through the mud to get a closer look, they saw that the tombstone marked the man as being buried during the reign of the Zhengde Emperor which was in 1505-1521, in the Ming dynasty.As quickly as they unearthed it, the local cultural relics bureau confirmed the dating and then deemed it of no real archaeological value.

      <title>Air pollution and CO2 levels plummet amid pandemic</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  As the world battle's with China's latest gift to humanity, levels of pollutants in the air over many cities have dropped as the Xi Jinping Virus affects work and travel. BBC reports that researchers in New York say carbon monoxide primarily from cars has been reduced by almost 50 percent compared to last year. Carbon dioxide emissions have also taken a sharp dive. As economies around the world are feeling the effects of the Pooh Virus, emissions of a whole bunch of nasty gases that come with energy and transportation have dramatically been reduced. According to scientists, C02 emissions are at their highest in May due to decomposing leaves, the levels recorded could be the lowest we've seen since the global subprime mortgage crisis over a decade ago. Columbia University researchers said that in the Big Apple alone, traffic levels were down 35 percent compared to a year ago. The enormous levels of carbon monoxide spewed out from cars and trucks fell around 50 percent for a few days last week. According to the Beebs, they also found a 5-10 percent drop in CO2 over New York and a big drop in methane too. Similar drops in pollutants were also found in China and Italy. Unfortunately, once the world gets over this China Cough-19 thing, most countries are going to focus on getting their economies going again at all costs, regardless of the impact on the environment. Fantastic.]]></description>

      <title>UPDATE: Coronavirus can last up to 17 days on surfaces</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ATLANTA  According to the latest report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RNA material from the coronavirus can last on some surfaces for longer than previous research has shown.Experts analyzed the interior of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined off Yokohama, Japan, and found RNA material from the coronavirus in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic passengers that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 17 days after they had left the cruise.This evidence was found prior to disinfection of the rooms.The CDC specified in their report that although RNA of the virus was present, it does not mean live virus was still on the surfaces. It is also unclear whether or not this RNA is infectious.Commenting on the report, the MIT Technology Review says proper disinfection of surfaces kills traces of the coronavirus on all surfaces.According to the CDC, cruise ships facilitate viral outbreaks due to the close contact of passengers in close quarters.The CDC report states that altogether, the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess cruises carried more than 800 COVID-19 cases that resulted in 10 deaths.]]></description>

      <title>This worm from 555 million years ago is probably your ancestor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA  Geologists examining fossil impressions from South Australia have found evidence of the earliest relative of most animal life on Earth, a tiny, wormlike creature that lived 555 million years ago, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Writing in a news release, scientists at the University of California, Riverside say laser scans suggest the Ikaria wariootia was about the size of a grain of rice, 7mm long and 2.5mm wide at the largest. They were wide in the head, narrow in the rear, and possessed bilateral symmetry. This suggests they had a mouth, anus and gut.The wormlike creatures are the oldest animals ever found to possess bilateral symmetry. This suggests they may be the first common ancestors to animals organized along the bilateral body plan, including dinosaurs, insects and humans.According to the news release, bilateral symmetrical was a crucial evolutionary step that gave animals an efficient way to organize their body and to move purposefully.The ocean floor-dwelling creatures lived during the Ediacaran Period. Scientists say the worms likely possessed senses that allowed them to navigate the well-oxygenated sands and search for organic matter to consume.]]></description>

      <title>Vicar catches fire during home sermon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLYMOUTH, UNITED KINGDOM  Things got a little hot under the dog collar when a vicar conducted a virtual sermon and accidentally set himself on fire. The Church of England recently requested all public worship to be suspended until further notice because of the Coronavirus.  Reverend Stephen Beach from Saint Budeaux Church in Plymouth, decided to invite his flock to a virtual Sunday service, broadcasted live from his home last weekend.  To create the ambiance of his at-home sermon the vicar lit five candles and placed them in a cross-shaped candle holder in the near background of the video. But as he spoke from the book of truth to his audience through the camera, he sat a tad too close to one of the naked flames.And in typical British fashion, he deemed himself on fire with, "Oh dear, I've just caught on fire. Oh, my word."The video was shared by the vicar's niece on Twitter and since the video went viral, the priest's niece has reassured the internet that her uncle is unharmed, except for a new hole in his favorite sweater.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Coronavirus challenge: Man licks toiletries in supermarket</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. LOUIS  So, another coronavirus licking-related incident has happened. And no, we are not surprised or mad ... just, disappointed.The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports yet another video of another faulty human specimen went viral after he decided he wanted to be part of the 'licking things in exchange for internet points and validation' team.The young man seemed to be intoxicated when he filmed himself in the toiletries aisle of a Walmart about an hour west of St. Louis, Missouri.He then pulled down his facemask and said to the camera, 'Who's scared of the coronavirus? Don't touch your mouth?'While still filming he then proceeded to lean over and run his tongue all over the products captioning his video, 'I'm a nasty moths f***er', and yes, that's how he spelled it.According to St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the Warrenton Police Department said in a statement on Monday the man has been taken into custody and charges are pending. Thank God.Warrenton police said they received tips from concerned citizens around the world: "We have received numerous reports about the video from locals, nearby residents, as well as people from the Netherlands, Ireland, and the United Kingdom," the statement said. "We take these complaints very seriously and would like to thank all of those who reported the video so the issue could be addressed.We are at a loss of words at this point. It's because of people like Missouri Man that we are in the situation that we are in.

      <title>Frenchman runs marathon on balcony because of virus</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOULOUSE, FRANCE  A man in France stuck at home because of the Xi Jinping Sniffles-19 decided it wasn't going to stop him from running a marathon, so he decided to run in on his balcony. According to the Associated Press, Elisha Nochomovitz ran 26.2 miles on his 23-foot-long balcony. According to the AP, he saw it as a physical and mental challenge, and he also shared the images online as a way "to extend my support to the entire medical personnel who are doing an exceptional job." He ran the balcony marathon from his apartment in Balma, a suburb in Toulouse.It took him six hours and 48 minutes to finish the one man race. He also made himself a bit nauseous in the process, and also worried he would piss off his neighbors with all the noise. Apparently, Nochomovitz had been training for a marathon and wanted to see if he could run in whatever condition. He told AP he lost track of how many laps he did, but luckily his pedometer kept track for him. So, how's it going to take before someone tries a triathlon on his or her balcony?]]></description>

      <title>Are container ship exhaust fumes delaying climate change?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  New research suggests that exhaust fumes from container ships could be delaying the effects of climate change.According to the University of Washington, exhaust fumes from container ships have sulfate particles that attract water molecules. These transform into cloud droplets that can pack clouds and, in turn, reflect solar radiation before it warms the ocean. Researchers looked at satellite data from one of the busiest Atlantic shipping lanes from between 2003 and 2015. They calculated what the lane would've looked like with emissions and without. They say that the difference helps to clarify how much industrial pollution influences clouds.The University of Washington posits that without the cooling effect of these sulfate particles the Earth may have already heated by 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is a change deemed to have significant societal impacts by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. will waive environmental laws to build border wall</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Donald Trump's new plans to quicken the construction of the border wall poses a great threat to biodiversity and the environment, and in particular the jaguar.On March 16, the Department of Homeland Security announced it will waive a number of environmental laws and regulations to accelerate the construction of border walls in Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise counties in Arizona. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, parts of the new border walls will run through remote natural environments and block jaguars from migrating between Mexico and the southwestern U.S.They will also isolate a small breeding population of northern jaguars in Sonora, Mexico  hindering repopulation efforts.The jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas and one of the four big cats of the Panthera genus, the others being the lion, tiger and leopard.Inhabitat reports other animals that will be negatively impacted by the new border walls are the Mexican gray wolf, the lesser long-nosed bat, the ocelot, the Sonoran pronghorn and the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl.A 2017 report by the Center for Biological Diversity states that: 'a minimum of 93 species at risk of extinction will be further imperiled by construction of Trump's border wall, including impacts to critical habitat for 25 of these species.']]></description>

      <title>Ozone layer's recovery is protecting wind systems</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  The ozone layer's recovery is stopping changes in the atmospheric circulation systems of the Southern Hemisphere, according to new research.Writing in a study published in Nature, researchers say the Montreal Protocol is curbing ozone depletion, a phenomenon responsible for Antarctica's ozone hole. This hole has disrupted atmospheric circulation in the southern hemisphere, including shifting the mid-latitude jet stream poleward. The Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987 to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, from air conditioning, refrigerators and packaging. According to the study, the international accord's removal of CFC pollution has halted the jet stream's drift to the south.Writing in a news release, the University of Colorado Boulder says its researchers believe climate warming is driving the jet stream to the Southern Pole. Ozone layer recovery exerts an opposite effect that has paused the shift.According to the university, ozone depletion is also linked to the southward expansion of the Southern Hemisphere's tropical dry region, which affects rainfall in South America, East Africa and Australia.]]></description>

Residents can be heard joining in as the other officers clap and dance around in circles.As quickly as the song started, the officers applauded themselves, jumped back into their vehicles and were, presumably, on their way to another show.Local media reports that the officers played from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. spreading the joy and lifting the spirits of an otherwise grief-stricken nation.

      <title>Quasars literally blasts stars away before they can be born</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BLACKSBURG, VIRGINIA  Quasar black holes emit radiation so powerful that they can prevent star formation in the surrounding galaxy, according to a study in the Astrophysical Journal Supplementary Letters.Writing on behalf of co-author Nahum Arav, a Virginia Tech press release says quasar outflows rip through interstellar space to generate intense light and heat. The quasar radiation blasts away matter that is needed for birthing stars. The radiation emissions dubbed quasar winds blow hundreds of solar masses of material away each year. According to Science Alert, quasars spend billions of years in this violent state before maturing into more conventional black holes.According to the research team, it is a scientific puzzle that the universe does not have bigger galaxies or more numerous stars than it actually possesses. They say quasars at the core of elliptical galaxies could be part of the answer.]]></description>

      <title>Neanderthals ate seafood, new research suggests</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GRUTA DA FIGUEIRA BRAVA, PORTUGAL  Research published in the journal Science has found that Neanderthals living on the coast of Portugal ate a variety of seafood.This is contrary to the thinking that humans were unique in their ability to hunt for marine lifeCiting the research, the BBC reports that Neanderthals were found to have eaten sharks, dolphins, mussels, crabs, eels, sea bream, seals and some sea birds. Food from marine resources is thought to have made up half of the Neanderthal diet. The rest is said to consist of ancient cattle, horse, deer, goat and tortoise.It is believed that humans developed their creativity and cognition from eating the brain-enhancing fats of marine life.Research from earlier this year found evidence that suggested Neanderthals living in a cave in Italy used to dive for shellfish. It is thought that they used the shellfish not only for food, but for making tools as well.]]></description>

      <title>British PM tells Brits, "we will do this together"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM  British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson has spoken in his first self-isolation video today since announcing he has Coronavirus; he took to Twitter to boost morale, expressing his gratitude to the nation and hero National Health Service workers on the frontline.Mr. Johnson said, "our policy remains unchanged, that is to delay the spread of the disease so as to reduce the pressure on the NHS, reduce the demand on the NHS at that critical peak moment and that's how we aim to save many thousands of lives.""I want to thank everybody who has been complying with our instructions to stay at home."In a rallying cry, he passionately stated, "We are going to do it. We are going to do it together.""I think one thing Coronavirus crisis has proved is that there is such a thing as society, so thank you to all of you and remember, stay at home."Protect our NHS and save lives."Mr. Johnson also praised the army of over 750,000 Coronavirus volunteers who have enlisted to assist the National Health workers in a move of public togetherness not seen since the Blitz. He also revealed 20,000 former National Health Service staff have returned to their posts to join the fight against the deadly disease.His comments come as case numbers in the U.K are at 19,522 and with the death toll currently standing at 1,228.To ensure national effort amid the crisis, the Prime Minister penned a letter now being sent out to British households this week, saying, "It's important for me to level with you, we know things will get worse before they get better."TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>WHO doctor ends call after question about Taiwan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIWAN  The World Health Organization or 'WHO', a body that promotes "health for all" shockingly continues to block Taiwan from its organization and access to first-hand data despite the current pandemic. Taiwan is a country that sits a mere 81-miles from China, the epicenter of the outbreak and yet impressively has just 298 cases as of the 30th of March. Taiwan then, could share crucial information on how to manage the Coronavirus if granted membership, a membership that potentially could save thousands of lives globally; so why are they blocked by the WHO? It's simple, China tells them to. Politics take precedence over people's lives and none are more guilty than WHO Assistant Director-General, Bruce Aylward.In an interview with RTHK producer Yvonne Tong, the epidemiologist plays deaf and pretends not to hear her question about whether the UN body would reconsider Taiwan's membership. "I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your question, Yvonneâ¦ let's move to another one then," he says, before hanging up. When Tong called him back to ask again about Taiwan and its coronavirus measures, Aylward shockingly said: "Well, we've already talked about China." A controversial comment that flirts with China's stance that Taiwan belongs to the communist regime. Aylward has regularly featured in Chinese state media after he led a WHO mission to the country during the outbreak; he has repeatedly praised the country's leadership and, at one press conference, stated that, if he was infected with the disease he would want to be treated in China.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>COVID-19 new symptoms: loss of sense of smell and taste</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WORLD  Anosmia, the loss of smell; hyposmia, a reduced sense of smell; and dysgeusia, the distortion of the sense of taste could all be linked to COVID-19. According to a report from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, anosmia, the loss of smell; hyposmia, a reduced sense of smell; and dysgeusia, the distortion of the sense of taste, should be added to the list of symptoms caused by the COVID-19 virus.In a newsletter on the topic, Claire Hopkins, President of the British Rhinological Society, and Nirmal Kumar, President of ENT UK, reported that more than two in three confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany have anosmia.Similarly, in South Korea, 30 percent of patients who tested positive for the virus had anosmia as their main symptom.The report also mentions anecdotal evidence that a patient can be generally asymptomatic, only presenting anosmia, and still test positive for COVID-19. However, patients with just anosmia are often not tested or asked to self-isolate as this symptom is not yet recognized as a sign of coronavirus.]]></description>
