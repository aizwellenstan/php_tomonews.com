      <video:title><![CDATA[Why the novel coronavirus did not come from a lab 3981630]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN DIEGO — The novel coronavirus did not originate from a research laboratory, according to a study published in Nature Medicine. 

Researchers say the novel coronavirus was not made in a lab, after comparing its RNA sequence to SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses including the HKU1, which is known to cause mild symptoms in humans. 

Citing the authors, Live Science reports the study focuses on the novel coronavirus's spike protein.

The protein consists of receptor binding domains, also known as RBDs, and a cleavage site.

The RBD hooks on to an ACE2 receptor on the surface of human cells, then the cleavage site opens the receptor for the virus to enter.

The spike protein design is deemed so effective that it could only have resulted from natural selection and not human engineering.

When scientists simulated the virus in computer models, they found computers to underate COVID-19's infectiousness by a significant margin.

Study co-author Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research was cited as saying if scientists designed the virus, they would not have chosen the spike protein mutations that seemed ineffective.

Additionally, biological weapons were usually created from deadly viruses, but SARS-CoV-2's close relatives are bat and pangolin viruses that are largely innocuous.

The virus is speculated to have spread from bats to pangolins to humans. According to the researchers, they are working to determine at what point SARS-CoV-2 developed the cleavage site mutations that increased its infectiousness. 3981630]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[WHO Director-General blames Taiwan for his bad reputation 3981623]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIWAN — The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom is pointing his finger at Taiwan for his now soiled reputation amid the Coronavirus outbreak.

According to ETtoday, a netizen going by 'Osuka Yip' started a petition on Change.org on January 23rd, which demanded that Adhanom be replaced as the leader of the World Health Organization or 'WHO'. 

The user believed that Adhanom's initial refusal to declare the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency has led to millions being infected by the disease.

Yip said, a lot of us are really disappointed, we believe that the WHO is supposed to be politically neutral. Without any investigation, Adhanom solely believes in the death and infected numbers that the Chinese government provided them.

As of today, nearly 700,000 people have signed this petition and the Ethiopian health official is reported to have accused Taiwanese netizens for the bulk of that. 

Up Media state that the U.S. government has informed Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Director-General believes the accusations of incompetence are all part of some elaborate scheme carried out by Taiwanese keyboard warriors, as opposed to there being any truth to the claim he failed in his position. 

Despite his beliefs that the Taiwanese are behind his soiled reputation, many international leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have publicly bashed him and his team for their delayed response to the Coronavirus. 

Furthermore, during a House of Councillors meeting on March 26th, Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso also mocked WHO's supposed political neutrality, saying a lot of people believe its name should be changed to CHO, or Chinese Health Organization.

Not helping his case, on the 24th of March the Taiwanese government did actually confirm that it had warned the WHO about the human-to-human transmission of the virus last December but was ignored.

      <video:description><![CDATA[GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, GERMANY — Thailand's controversial King Maha Vajiralongkorn, also known as Rama X reportedly booked out an entire 4-star hotel, after the resort received special permission from the district council. 

The local district council says that the guests are a single, homogeneous group of people with no fluctuation.

German tabloid, Bild reports that the 67-year-old King's entourage included a harem of 20 concubines and numerous servants.

119 members of his original entourage had been reportedly sent back to Thailand over fears they had contracted the Coronavirus. 

News of his luxurious self-isolation was met with anger by tens of thousands of Thai people who risked breaking the country's laws by criticizing him online.

Under said laws, anyone who insults or criticizes the monarchy could be imprisoned for up to 15 years.

The Independent says that a Thai hashtag which translated to Why do we need a king? appeared 1.2 million times on Twitter within 24 hours after an activist claimed the King was traveling on holiday in Germany while the outbreak continued to spread across Thailand.

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPEI — Washing your hands thoroughly and often with soap and water for at least 20 to 30 seconds is one of the most effective ways to eliminate the coronavirus from your skin.

Soap molecules have a hydrophilic head which is attracted to water and a hydrophobic tail that seeks to bond with lipids such as oils and fats.

Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses. Their key components are RNA, the virus's genetic material; proteins that allow the virus to infect cells; and a lipid envelope that coats the virus. This lipid membrane has two rings of hydrophilic heads surrounding two layers of hydrophobic tails.

Soap molecules destabilize a coronavirus because their hydrophobic tails are attracted to lipids in the virus's lipid bilayer. The soap molecules stick to lipids in the bilayer and pry them apart, encapsulating them in bubbles called micelles that wash away in the lather.

In addition to disrupting the lipid membrane of the virus, soap molecules also disrupt the bonds that hold the proteins, lipids and viral RNA together. They effectively pull the virus apart, and the viral particles are rinsed away in water. 3982006]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEWTON-LE-WILLOWS, UNITED KINGDOM — Medical fetish company, MedFet UK donated disposable scrubs after it was contacted by procurement representatives struggling to find the right equipment amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The fetish company tweeted, today we donated our entire stock of disposable scrubs to an NHS hospital. It was just a few sets, because we don't carry large stocks, but they were desperate, so we sent them free of charge.
When we, a tiny company set up to serve a small section of the kink community, find ourselves being sought out as a last-resort supplier to our National Health Service in a time of crisis, something is seriously wrong. In fact, it's scandalous.

They added, So when it's all over… and the doctors, nurses and other staff have done an amazing job (as they undoubtedly will despite the circumstances)… let's not forgotten, or forgive, the ones who sent the NHS into this battle with inadequate armor and one hand tied behind its back.

The company then took it upon themselves to share some public health advice with, whether getting ready for some kinky fun or guarding against a virus outbreak, the single most effective method of infection control is scrupulous hand hygiene.

      <video:description><![CDATA[HONG KONG — New research shows SARS-CoV-2 can survive on the outer layer of a surgical mask for seven days.

New research published in medRxive by medical specialists in Hong Kong shows how long SARS-CoV-2 can survive on different surfaces and in different environments.

The researchers pipetted a droplet of virus culture on several surfaces including paper, tissue paper, wood, cloth, glass, a banknote, stainless steel, plastic, the inner layer of a surgical mask and the outer layer of a surgical mask.

Results showed that there was no trace of the infectious virus on printing and tissue paper three hours after incubation.

The infectious virus stopped being present on wood and cloth by Day 2 after incubation. Glass surfaces and banknotes had no trace of the virus by Day 4. Stainless steel and plastic surfaces had no detectable virus on their surfaces by Day 7.

However, the infectious virus could still be detected on the outer layer of a surgical mask by Day 7.

The research concludes that although the virus is stable in a wide range of environments, it is still vulnerable to standard disinfection methods.

Previous research by American health officials and experts published in medRxiv showed that the novel coronavirus can survive in air particles for several hours and on some surfaces for up to three days. 3981975]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BROOKLYN, NEW YORK — Brooklyn-based photographer, Jeremy Cohen isn't usually smooth when it comes to talking to the ladies, but when he spotted his neighbour jiving on her rooftop, he let his tech do the talking. 

The Tik-Tok video has since gone viral with the 28-year-old photographer sharing the romance to his twitter account on March 22nd, saying, I can't believe this actually works and yes this is a real story.

The tweet has now been viewed more than six million times.

Cohen said, flirting was normally daunting for me, but since I've been quarantining in my apartment for a week now, I was craving some social interaction. He added, 2020 has been off to a terrible start, but I still needed to shoot my shot.

In part 2 of the meet-cute series, they indulged in a virtual date with Cohen telling Insider, it's very Gen Z.

And in part 3, the smooth streamer rolled over to meet Tori Cignarella, who eventually revealed her name on a real date, inside a plastic bubble to take a walk side-by-side.

      <video:description><![CDATA[WORLD — Shoppers across the world are finding imaginative ways to utilize household wares and employ them into their arsenal against the Coronavirus. 

While the classic black bin bag was used as a type of kevlar, other shoppers braving the supermarkets donned gas masks, and some even snorkeling goggles to make sure they stay out of harm's way.

But with the Coronavirus not going away anytime soon, some people have stepped it up a notch and just got in plastic bags. 

There's no doubt self-isolation has assisted with their creative protective gear, but as long as people are protecting themselves, who're we to judge?

      <video:title><![CDATA[Stacks of Coronavirus urns cast doubt on official Wuhan death toll 3982433]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WUHAN, CHINA — As China's regime pushes a narrative of how Xi Jinping is winning the war on the Coronavirus, and that Wuhan only suffered a very questionable 2,548 deaths, images surfacing online of stacks of urns and long queues at funeral homes cast doubt over their dubious claims. 

According to Bloomberg, the families of those who succumbed to the virus in Wuhan were allowed to collect their cremated ashes at numerous funeral homes last week, and as they did, photos began to circulate online that show thousands of urns being shipped in. 

According to Chinese media outlet Caixin, outside one funeral home, trucks delivered around 2,500 urns on both Wednesday and Thursday. 

Another picture showed 3,500 urns stacked on the ground inside; that one funeral home alone already exceeds the official number of those dead.

Residents in Wuhan claim 500 urns have been handed out to grieving families every day from seven separate funeral homes all serving the city.

This means the ashes of 3,500 people are distributed every 24 hours.

The funeral homes in Hankou, Wuchang and Hanyang have told grieving families that they will receive the ashes before April 5th, the date of the Qing Ming festival where people tend the graves of their ancestors. 

This means that 42,000 urns could be distributed in that 12-day period.

On the 27th March, one Wuhan resident going only by his surname Zhang told Radio Free Asia, It can't be right because the incinerators have been working round-the-clock, so how can so few people have died?

Another local resident, Chen Yaohui told RFA that nobody believes the official death toll, saying they transferred cremation workers from around China to Wuhan to keep cremating bodies round-the-clock. 3982433]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPEI — The COVID-19 coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, spreads through droplets that people make when we talk, cough or sneeze. The virus can be carried for up to 27 feet and land on the respiratory system, according to a study in the Journal of American Medical Association.

A gene sequence study published in Frontiers in Medicine showed that the coronavirus targets human cells with ACE2 receptors. This means the epithelial cells in the lungs and other organs are vulnerable to the coronavirus.

The coronavirus has mutations in the spike proteins on its surface. The mutations to the receptor binding domains, or RBDs, allow the virus to use human ACE2 receptors as entry points for getting into the cell.

According to the British Society for Immunology, the virus hijacks the cell and commandeers the structures inside the cell to make more copies of itself. The infected cell's ribosomes are directed to create viral RNA and proteins.

After that, the cell's Golgi apparatus puts the proteins and RNA together and coats them in protein, which creates new copies of the coronavirus.

The biochemical distress of being hijacked by the virus eventually kills the cell, which causes damage to the infected tissue.

At the same time, the body tries to fight off the infection by sending killer T-cells. The killer cells search and destroy compromised cells. The immune system's attack on the infected part of the body leads to more tissue damage and inflammation.

Speaking to the Guardian, John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician, said the coronavirus infection spreads down the respiratory system and may reach the alveoli at the bottom of the lungs. This fills the lungs with liquids and inflammatory materials.

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, breathing difficulties and muscle pains. Citing doctors, the New York Times reports the virus may move in the blood to attack the heart, the kidneys, and the liver. Lung damage would also deprive patients of blood oxygen.

George Washington University Hospital reports that 20 percent of COVID-19 patients are symptomatic. A portion of these develop severe symptoms and become unable to breathe without using ventilators or other medical devices. 3982354]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — The coronavirus has halted almost all aspects of daily life, but crowd prevention regulations in China are making the Qingming Festival, or Tomb Sweeping Day especially difficult.

Tomb Sweeping, a day of tidying the graves of loved ones falls on April 4th this year and those unable to do so, because of said regulations can apply to have cemetery workers do it for them.

While the holiday usually bears witness to masses gathering at cemeteries across the country, authorities this year are capping the number of people to avoid those big crowds. 

An online reservation system has been rolled out, but if you aren't able to book your spot, workers at Beijing's Babaoshan Cemetery can and will honor your dead for you. 

Photos published online to ChinaNews.com show a three-person team dressed in protective gear; they scrub tombstones, leave flowers behind and then bow. 

Similar systems have since been set up at Shanghai's cemeteries where all 160,000 Tomb Sweeping Day slots have now been taken.

      <video:description><![CDATA[ROMAN-SUR-ISÉRE, FRANCE — French authorities have launched a terrorism probe after a knife attack killed two people and wounded five in the township of Romans-sur-Isère on April 4, Reuters reports. According to BBC News, the attack began at a tobacconist's shop in the town square.  

AFP reports suspect Abdallah Ahmed-Osman, a Sudanese refugee in his 30s, stabbed the owners and a customer. After that, he attacked several more people in two other stores including a butcher's shop.

Citing the butcher shop's owner, AFP reports Ahmed-Osman seized another knife and stabbed a customer, who died despite the shop owners' efforts to save the victim. The suspect then allegedly ran outside and attacked people queued up by a bakery.

According to AFP, the police arrested Ahmed-Osman as he knelt in prayer while speaking in Arabic. The police arrested a second Sudanese managed 28 at Ahmed-Osman's residence and later detained a third, younger Sudanese man who also lived in the household. Texts with religious connotations were recovered. 3983868]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China Holds 3-Minute Silence To Mourn Those Lost To Coronavirus 3983750]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — To mourn those who succumbed to the Coronavirus, China's 1.38 billion people stood silently on Saturday morning to the tune of cars, trains, and ships sounding their horns for three minutes. 

The three minutes of silence symbolically occurred on the Qingming Festival or Tomb Sweeping Day in China on the 4th at 10 a.m. 

All public activities were suspended with flags at half-mast; the subway trains in Shanghai also stopped running for the duration and sounded their horns too. 

The mass event commemorates the deaths of more than 81,000 people in China, including 14 frontline medical workers who have been declared martyrs of the epidemic. 

Most memorable, of course, is none other than Dr. Li Wenliang who was punished by Chinese authorities for sounding the alarm about the outbreak back in December; a mind-boggling move that potentially enabled the then epidemic to become a pandemic.

      <video:description><![CDATA[LAKEWOOD, WASHINGTON — A man was detained last Sunday after he decided he'd give his dog a driver's ed class that ended up in a high-speed police chase.

According to CNN, police were onto the driver after they received a call about him hitting two vehicles south of Seattle and then just driving away like nothing happened.

Little did the police know that this would become a 109 mile an hour high-speed chase between them and a white 1996 Buick.

Finally, while attempting to corner the crazed driver, a police trooper caught a glimpse of who was on the driver's seat. The answer? A pit bull. 

You'd think that's where it would all end, but no, the man did not stop until troopers put out spike strips. That's when they learned the reasoning behind the reckless driving, the man was, trying to teach his dog how to drive. Yes. That was his excuse.

Comedy aside, during the chase, the man, sorry, dog, drove onto a trail for pedestrians and cyclists that is usually pretty busy so things could've ended pretty badly. Thankfully, they didn't.

According to AFP, the pet driving instructor was later identified as 51-year-old Alberto Tito Alejandro and apparently he has a history of driving under the influence of drugs. We're not surprised.

Seattle state trooper and public information officer Heather Axtman told CNN, I've been a trooper for almost 12 years and wow, I've never heard this excuse. I've been in a lot of high-speed chases, I've stopped a lot of cars, and never have I gotten an excuse that they were teaching their dog how to drive.

If you're worried about the real victim of the situation here, the cute pit bull who had to be subjected to this nightmarish class, she is doing well and currently chilling at a shelter. 3983673]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Coronavirus: Doctor Dies One Day Before Seeing Her Family 3984090]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — After returning from the frontline of the Coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, a Chinese doctor tragically passed away before she was reunited with her family. 

According to a report on the Chinese social media platform, Weibo, Dr. Zhang Jingjing spent a total of two months in the city of Huanggang before returning to Shandong province on the 21st of March. 

She was then put into a 14-day isolation period upon her arrival back.

However, on April 5th, just one day away before being allowed home, Zhang suffered a fatal heart attack; efforts to save her proved unsuccessful and she was declared dead on Monday evening.

The report claims that she leaves behind a 5-year-old daughter and a husband, who is working in Africa and hasn't been able to fly home.

Zhang, who was only in her mid-thirties tested negative three times for COVID-19; therefore it's not currently clear what caused her cardiac arrest.

A number of doctors in China did die from exhaustion alone, after working for weeks straight combatting the outbreak.

One such doctor was a 51-year-old woman who died after working 18 days straight in February; she was posthumously labeled a role model for other medics by provincial officials a label that surely pressures doctors to work to exhaustion and to death.

      <video:title><![CDATA[CONSPIRACY: 5G Towers Set On Fire After Links To COVID-19 3984078]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM — Conspiracy theories linking the rollout of 5G towers to the spread of the coronavirus has instigated the attack and arson on multiple cell towers last week in the U.K.

EE, o2, Three, and Vodafone, the top four major U.K mobile operators issued a joint statement asking for help to stop people burning 5G towers.

The online conspiracy theories that link the spread of the coronavirus with 5G have gathered momentum on both Facebook and Nextdoo, despite the fact, there's no scientific evidence to suggest a link.

In their joint statement the top four operators said, Sadly, we have experienced cases of vandals setting fire to mobile masts, disrupting critical infrastructure and spreading false information suggesting a connection between 5G and the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no scientific evidence of any link between 5G and coronavirus. Fact. 

They add, Not only are these claims baseless, they are harmful for the people and businesses that rely on the continuity of our services. They have also led to the abuse of our engineers and, in some cases, prevented essential network maintenance taking place.

Speaking to The Verge, Vodafone confirmed that four cell towers were targeted in a 24-hour period on Friday the 3rd and EE said that one tower in Birmingham didn't even provide 5G services but was set on fire regardless. 

Youtube has now said that it will suppress content promoting false 5G coronavirus conspiracy theories in a bid to stop the spread of disinformation. 

The severity of the situation is as such, as the country battles with the ongoing pandemic, attacks on critical national infrastructure threaten the ability to communicate effectively therefore such unfounded theories should be ignored.

      <video:description><![CDATA[SINGAPORE — New research by health specialists from Singapore shows evidence that asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 can inadvertently spread the virus.

According to a new study from Singapore published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, medical researchers studied 243 cases of coronavirus infections that occurred in Singapore from January 23 to March 16.

Out of these 243 cases, researchers detected seven clusters of cases that showed possible presymptomatic transmission of the virus. The researchers determined that 10 cases from these seven clusters were due to presymptomatic transmission.

For example, a man in Cluster E had traveled to Japan from February 29 to March 8 where he may have been infected. The man later infected his housemate before showing any symptoms. Both developed symptoms on March 11.

A woman in Cluster B, named Patient B1 in the paper, attended an event on February 15 where she likely came into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Nine days later she attended singing classes with another woman, Patient B2. Two days later Patient B1 developed symptoms. Patient B2 developed symptoms on February 29.

So, what can we do? Well, while wearing facemasks is not a guarantee that you won't get the virus, it is a good tool in preventing potentially contaminated droplets of saliva from others (and yourself) from spreading[d].

The U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommends, quote, 'wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.'[e]

However, this does not mean you have a green light to go and stock up on medical-grade surgical masks, leave those for the professionals. They truly need them now.[f] What you can do is buy a washable cloth mask, or make one yourself.

And it goes without saying. Wash your hands and practice social distancing protocol people. 3984033]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON —  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is spending his second night in the intensive care unit at St. Thomas' Hospital in London after being admitted to the hospital on Sunday.

The BBC reports Johnson was presenting symptoms of the COVID-19 coronavirus on March 27. Later that day he tested positive for the disease.

By April 3, seven days after testing positive, the prime minister was still presenting symptoms while self-isolating.

On April 5, he was admitted to the hospital for further examinations after his coronavirus symptoms persisted.

Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit on April 6, where he has spent two nights under close medical supervision. Quoting foreign secretary and current deputy to the prime minister, Dominic Raab, the Guardian reports that Johnson has received oxygen but hasn't required invasive respiratory support.

Johnson is now one of the thousands of coronavirus cases reported in the United Kingdom, and potentially one of many more to come[f].

According to predictions from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, the UK is projected to have 66,000 COVID-19 deaths by August.[g]

However, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, an epidemiologist who advises the government, told the Guardian that the model, quote, does not match the current UK situation, explaining that the health care model used for the predictions was wrong in the case of the UK. 3984644]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Evidence suggests coronavirus transmission through breathing 3984450]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — A message to the White House from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine found strong evidence in the existing scientific literature that the novel coronavirus may be spread through normal breathing. 

The report, issued on April 1, buttresses the argument that asymptomatic people should wear masks to reduce inadvertent transmission of the virus. 

In an email to Science Insider, Kimberly Prather, an aerosol chemist at the University of California, San Diego, said she was relieved to see aerosolization is accepted.

This added airborne pathway helps explain why it is spreading so fast, she said.

As late as March 27, a scientific brief from the World Health Organization stated that an analysis of more than 75,000 COVID-19 cases in China found no cases of the virus spreading through aerosols. 

On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its previous advice on wearing masks in public, and recommended that everyone wear cloth face coverings while in public during the pandemic.

In its announcement, the CDC stressed that surgical masks or N-95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders. 3984450]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[The biggest and brightest moon of 2020: The Pink Supermoon 3984408]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — The moon will reach its closest point to Earth in 2020 on April 7, getting as close as 356,907 kilometers from Earth. This phenomenon is popularly known as the Super Pink Moon.

According to NASA, the full moon will appear on Tuesday night. It will emerge on the opposite side of the sun, according to earth-based longitude, at 10:35 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

The closeness between Earth and a supermoon makes the moon seem around  7 percent larger than the average full moon and 14 percent brighter than when the moon is at apogee.

NASA explains that the Super Pink Moon receives its name from the herb moss pink, also known as 'wild ground phlox' which blooms in eastern United States during spring.

Unfortunately, with all the lockdowns and self-isolation regulations imposed in countries around the world, not many people will be out moon-gazing.

But hey, if you have a window, or porch or any access to the outside world, take a moment to go out, look up at the sky and forget the corona craze for just a while[b]. 3984408]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Explainer: How bacteria give the rain its unique smell 3984893]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NORFOLK, UNITED KINGDOM — New research may explain why rainfall on the soil creates a unique scent in the air. According to the study published in Nature, the smell of rain is caused by geosmin, a chemical secreted by a genus of soil-dwelling bacteria called streptomyces.

Writing a news release from John Innes Centre, researchers say the scent is bait for springtails, tiny 1.5mm-long arthropods.

The tiny six-legged animals sport antennas to detect geosmin. As springtails are attracted to the substance, they follow the scent and eat the bacteria.

By encouraging springtails to eat them, streptomyces get their spores on the arthropods and in their feces, which allows the bacteria to spread and reproduce. This mutually beneficial relationship may have endured for 450 million years.

Streptomyces produce antibiotics that kill nematodes and fruit flies, but not springtails. According to the scientists, this is evidence that springtails have evolved to privilege the bacteria as a food source, which the springtails help to spread. 3984893]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Conor McGregor Slams 'Barbaric' China Over 'Inhumane Behaviour' 3984820]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[IRELAND — UFC's Conor McGregor has slammed China and cast an unforgiving light on the regime after RTE reported that some personal protective equipment or PPE delivered from China did not conform to safety standards. 

The 31-year-old was understandably less than impressed and ripped into what he calls the barbaric Chinese government for, ludicrously inhumane behavior.

Conor slammed China and labeled their actions truly horrendous. He added, not only are the prices being raised by these people on all our items. Masks, visors, gloves, ventilators, respirators, oxygen containers, screen monitors, you name it. All jacked in price.

The batches coming in are now of no use! Ludicrously inhumane behavior.

The MMA star has urged his hundreds of millions of followers to stay at home and remain vigilant; he has also admirably donated huge sums of money to help fund the fight against the coronavirus. 

On his Twitter account, McGregor made the following pledge: Today I am purchasing myself, €1 million worth of personal protective equipment to be deployed to all the fighting hospitals in the Leinster region. Our most affected region, to this date.

The substandard medical equipment sent by Xi Jinping's government is inexcusable and such actions continue to cloud their reputation on a global scale after attempting to cover up the outbreak, to begin with. 

McGregor has since demanded that the Irish government withdraw their gratitude for the medical equipment received from China, as let's be honest it really is inhumane.

      <video:title><![CDATA[WHO chief accuses Taiwan of racism, Taiwan denies accusations 3985449]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[GENEVA — During a press conference on Wednesday, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he had been receiving racist comments and death threats from Taiwan for months. 

Now, what's interesting to us here at TomoNews is that he said quote, this attack came from Taiwan. Does he mean China? We're just saying because, you know, isn't Taiwan part of China in his world? Hmmm.

He also made it a point to say that the whole African community had been insulted by these comments and that he would not tolerate it. Wait till he hears about the Uighur internment camps in China.

Taiwan's Foreign Ministry replied to the allegations on Thursday in a statement saying that Taiwan understood quote, 'how he feels given that the 23 million people of Taiwan have long experienced the serious political discrimination of the international health system' end quote.

But I mean, let's not forget who really is behind this brawl. Yes, we mean Winnie the Xi.

For those of you who don't know, although Taiwan is clearly doing something well in terms of containing the spread of the coronavirus, it is still not allowed to participate in the WHO.

This is because China uses its economic clout to keep Taiwan from joining the organization. According to Beijing, Taiwan as a province of China is completely not qualified and has no right to participate in it. And, as per usual, the rest of the world kowtows to China and follows its lead. 

But no worries, guys. Taiwan has managed to fight its way through this pandemic without the WHO's help. According to data from Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control, since January there have been 380 confirmed cases and five deaths in this country of 23 million people. Much less than predicted and far less than China. So, yeah, you can keep that spot in the WHO, Xi, Taiwan doesn't need it. 3985449]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[NASA reveals plans for base camp near the Moon's South Pole 3985395]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — NASA submitted its plans for a lunar base camp to the National Space Council in a 13-page report entitled NASA's Plan for Sustained Lunar Exploration and Development on April 2.

The plans are part of NASA's Artemis program to send humans back to the Moon as early as 2024.

NASA plans to build its Artemis Base Camp near the Moon's South Pole. The base camp will provide a fixed outpost for exploration and in the long term would include a landing pad and infrastructure for power, radiation shielding, and waste disposal and storage.

Core elements for a sustained presence on the Moon would include a lunar terrain vehicle for mobility around the base camp, a habitable mobility platform that would allow for longer excursions on the Moon for up to 45 days, and a fixed lunar foundation surface habitat that could house as many as four astronauts for shorter periods of time.

NASA's planned Gateway outpost in lunar orbit would serve as a command and control center for operations on the Moon's surface, a rendez-vous point for spacecraft traveling to and from Earth, as well as provide living quarters and space to conduct scientific research.

In an April 3 article on its website, NASA said it envisions sending four astronauts to the Gateway for a multi-month stay to simulate a trip to Mars. 

Later, two crew members would travel to the lunar surface and explore with the habitable mobility platform.

The four astronauts would then be reunited aboard the Gateway for another multi-month stay to simulate the return trip to Earth.

NASA said: These missions will be by far the longest duration human deep-space missions in history. 3985395]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Scientists are deciphering the coronavirus's sugar camouflage 3985384]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SOUTHAMPTON, UNITED KINGDOM — A new study sheds light on the fundamental architecture of the coronavirus that allows the pathogen to disguise itself and get into human cells.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has a viral coating that is studded with spike proteins, which are the coronavirus's camouflage and infection tools.

According to a preprint paper published in BioArxiv, scientists have detailed the chemical makeup of the proteins by using electron microscopy and spectrometry. 

The researchers identified host-derived sugars — or glycans — embedded in the envelope of the spike protein, as well as the concentration of the sugars in each location on the spike.

Glycans are what viruses use for hiding from the immune system and sneaking into human cells.

Writing in a news release, the researchers say SARS-CoV-2's embedded glycan defenses are thinner than those of many other viruses.

This suggests the coronavirus is a hit and run virus that moves rapidly from one person to another.

Paper co-author Max Crispin is cited as saying the study about the coronavirus's sugars is a very encouraging message for vaccine development, and the research team is already working with partners who have designed candidate vaccines. 3985384]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Uber Driver Died After Woman 'Coughed Repeatedly' In Cab 3985368]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NORWOOD, UNITED KINGDOM — A 33-year-old Uber driver from Norwood, south London died from the coronavirus after expressing concern that a woman had repeatedly coughed in the back of his car. 

Shortly after picking up the woman in his cab, Mr. Ayub Akhtar, a fit and healthy family man began to have breathing problems. 

He expressed his concerns to his relatives and said he believed the passenger had the virus.

Mr. Akhtar, who lived with his mother and siblings, then began to show COVID-19 symptoms.

Speaking to The Mail Online, his brother, Yasser said: He told us about the lady coughing behind him in his Prius a few days before and that he was worried about it.

He added, I could hear his painful coughing from his bedroom at night and that he was struggling for breath.

Mr. Akthar was at first admitted to the Mayday Hospital in Croydon and transferred to St. George's Hospital, Tooting when he could no longer breathe properly. 

He sent a heartbreaking text to his family from his hospital bed telling them to, Pray for me — that text would be his last. 

Mr. Akhtar later died alone in intensive care last Friday after he could no longer breathe. 

His family report that he had no major illnesses prior to succumbing to the virus.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Ronaldinho Released And Now Under House Arrest In Paraguay 3985359]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[ASUNCION, PARAGUAY — Ronaldinho has finally been released from a maximum-security prison and placed under house arrest in Paraguay.

The 40-year-old Brazilain icon and 2005 Ballon d'Or winner was arrested on the 6th of March after accusations of using a fake passport when trying to enter Paraguay along with his brother.

The BBC reported that the duo had previously been denied bail, but since posted $800,000 each and now must stay in a four-star hotel in Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay.

In allowing the pair to leave prison, the judge claimed that the size of the bail paid was significant and would guarantee they will not flee.

Ronaldinho, who was branded stupid by his lawyer, along with his brother both continue to deny any wrongdoing, simply stating that they didn't know the documents were fake. 

The same lawyer called their imprisonment, arbitrary, abusive and illegal. 

The pair are now awaiting trial.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Pandemic Insurance: Wimbledon's Organizers Set For Huge Payout 3985332]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — The All England Lawn Tennis Association, which organizes the Wimbledon tennis tournament, is set to recover half of its losses from canceling the event thanks to the $2 million pandemic insurance it has taken out every year for the last 17 years.

This year's Wimbledon was scheduled to take place from June 29th to July 12th, but the outbreak of the coronavirus forced it to cancel — the first time since World War Two.  

However, Action Network reported that the organizers are set to receive a whopping $141 million payout thanks to the coronavirus pandemic insurance policy it has paid a total of $34 million for.

The insurance policy was reported by The Times in March before the event was canceled.

But most businesses in sports aren't lucky enough or cautious enough to have taken out pandemic insurance, and Action Network claims that many are relying on a very specific clause within their contracts, something called, force majeure, a French term that means superior force. The clause is meant to cover unexpected acts of God or nature.

Interestingly, as the pandemic has taken over the world, so too have force majeure searches on Google; the last time the term was searched this much was 16 years ago, according to the search engine's trends data.

The All England Lawn Tennis Association has not yet confirmed the figures but did tell Action Network sports business reporter, Darren Rovell that the club has always sought to buy the optimum insurance coverage available.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Coronavirus Lockdown Spurs Pandas To Finally Mate 3985298]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[ABERDEEN, HONG KONG — If there's one good thing to come of quarantine, it's that in our absence some timid pandas finally mated after 10 years. 

Ying Ying and Le Le are two 14-year-old giant pandas from Hong Kong's Ocean Park and keepers have been trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to get them to mate for the past ten years. 

Unsurprisingly, it seems that all they needed was a little privacy, which given the current circumstances, was granted. 

Pandas are notoriously difficult when it comes to breeding. They are extremely picky about choosing their mates, which means that even if a male and female panda are kept in the same enclosure for years, there is no guarantee the pair will mate.

Michael Boos, the CEO of operation and zoological conservation explained in a statement released by Ocean Park, Ying Ying and Le Le arrived in Hong Kong in 2007 and there have been attempts at natural mating since 2010. Nevertheless, they have not been successful until this year, after a long time of testing and learning.

Because of the pandemic, the park has not received visitors since January and these welcomed moments of intimacy between the pair coincided with the breeding season that occurs every year between March and May. 

Female pandas enter heat for one to three days, and that's the only window in which the male panda can hop on and get on.

According to the statement, sometime in late March after more than a month of unfamiliar privacy, Ying Ying began spending more time in the water; meanwhile, Le Le began leaving a trail of scents around his habitat and on Monday the 6th, the two were seen cuddling. 

Ocean Park proudly announced that the two pandas had succeeded in natural mating that day at 9:00 a.m.

Michael Boos said, The successful natural mating process today is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination.

The zoo had told us to bear with, but promises to keep us all updated about this momentous occasion.

      <video:description><![CDATA[MUNICH — Here's how a saltshaker helped researchers trace back the first evidence of human to human transmission of COVID-19 on German soil.

According to a report from Euractiv in collaboration with Reuters, Germany's Patient Zero was a Chinese woman working at the Shanghai branch of Webasto Group, a German car parts supplier. The woman's parents visited her from Wuhan before she left for Germany to attend meetings at the company's headquarters.

In order to trace back the origin of the spread, doctors looked into the records of staff meetings and interviewed employees.

Through the information they gathered, they found that the first German person infected by the Chinese woman was sitting next to her during a meeting on January 20.

Evidence showed that the fourth person to be infected, or case #4, had been in regular contact with the Chinese woman. On January 22, case #4 sat back to back with a co-worker at the office canteen, where they shared a salt shaker. Researchers believe this is when the coworker became the fifth person to be infected.

If you're asking yourself, 'How could doctors possibly have recorded the exact moment in which a salt shaker became suspect number one in the spread of the coronavirus?' Don't worry, the doctors themselves are kerfuffled.

Clemens Wendtner, the doctor who treated patients that got infected through this cluster, told Reuters, 'It was a stroke of luck.' Apparently, 'all it took' was gathering information from staff and boom, case closed.

Thankfully, the researchers' quick actions resulted in healthy employees. In a press release published on March 4, Webasto stated that all previously infected employees had been released from the hospitals and some had already gone back to work.

According to the latest data from the Robert Koch Institute, the German federal agency in charge of disease control and prevention, there are currently 120,479 COVID-19 cases and 2,673 deaths due to COVID-19 in Germany. Around 60,300 people have recovered from the viral disease. 3986277]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[NASA is looking at turning a Moon crater into a giant telescope 3986235]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — NASA is funding an early-stage concept to build a giant telescope in a crater on the far side of the moon through its NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, the space agency announced on April 7.

At a kilometer in diameter, the Lunar Crater Telescope would be the largest filled-aperture radio telescope in the Solar System.

Its location on the Moon's far side would isolate the telescope from electromagnetic interference from Earth, as well as allow it to observe longer wavelengths that are blocked by the Earth's ionosphere.

This would allow scientists to observe fingerprints left by the Big Bang as the universe expanded exponentially in less than a trillionth of a second after it came into existence.

NASA has given the project $125,000 for a nine-month study of the concept. Other projects that received funding from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program include a lunar landing pad and a robotic explorer for Saturn's moon Enceladus. 3986235]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Nearly 600 sailors have COVID-19 on a US aircraft carrier 3986225]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — A total of 585 sailors on the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt tested positive for COVID-19, the Navy said in a statement dated April 12. This figure represents 12 percent of the ship's 4,800 crew and an uptick of about 170 cases in three days.

Speaking to a news conference at the Pentagon on April 9, the Joint Chiefs of Staff's General John Hyten said one of the carrier's sailors with COVID-19 was found unresponsive in their isolation room and transferred to the ICU on Guam Island.

According to the Navy's statement, 3,967 sailors of the ship have moved ashore, and 92 percent of the crew have been tested as of April 12.

The U.S. Navy operates 11 aircraft carriers. According to National Public Radio, at least three of the advanced warships have reported COVID-19 cases onboard, which raises troubling questions about the fleet's military readiness. 3986225]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Donald Trump to Hold Talks on American Funding of the 'WHO' 3986188]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has yet again turned his attention to the failings of the World Health Organization and hinted that he will be holding talks about their U.S. funding next week.

During his White House press briefing last Friday, Trump slammed the UN organization for their handling of the COVID-19 crisis and letting China, get the better of the argument.

The WHO is under fire for their continued and unwavering praise of China, despite the fact Xi Jinping's regime suppressed information about the coronavirus and inhumanely delayed efforts to prevent its outbreak.

Trump has also accused the WHO of being, China-centric while the CIA told White House officials that Beijing was feeding the WHO false numbers, a claim that holds water considering China's infamous lack of clarity.

Regarding funding the WHO, Trump said, I don't like that. 

I don't think that's appropriate, I don't think it's fair to the American people.

I tell that to President Xi, I tell that to Dr. Tedros. We are going to be talking about that next week in great detail.

We want to make sure money is properly spent. Why is the US paying $500 million a year, why is China paying, this year, $42 million dollars?

The answer always turns out to be in China's favor.

Trump said he was looking into the possibility that he would halt the United States' funding of the World Health Organization for not having informed the world community on time about the threat of the coronavirus.

Trump said in a tweet: The WHO really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China-centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately, I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?

His comments prompted the Director-General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros to warn that politicizing the coronavirus will mean more body bags as the US death toll tops 22,000, a statement coming from the head of the organization that bans Taiwan from the WHO because of politics.

      <video:title><![CDATA[World Health Organization: Risking Your Life for China 3986167]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WORLD — Right now we're witnessing a true crime against humanity, Xi Jinping's China and the World Health Organization are attempting something outrageous; they're trying to change the narrative of how both bodies responded to the coronavirus and they're both scheming to avoid the responsibility of now 114,175 deaths, but we won't let them and you can help by just doing one thing: don't be tricked. 

We are currently at the mercy of the deadly coronavirus pandemic that has put millions of lives at stake, and yet there is grave cause for concern over the independence or political neutrality of the World Health Organization or WHO. 

Specifically, it's leadership who have regularly demonstrated their bootlicking to the Chinese Communist Party; the latest example, of course, is a now-viral video interview, in which a WHO senior adviser abruptly ends the interview when asked about Taiwan, questions Beijing despises. 

Alright, dodging questions about Taiwan to please Beijing isn't a be-all or end-all, but it is indicative of a systemic problem within WHO leadership: a subservience to Beijing that comes at the expense of its stated commitment to 'health care for all'.

But what if it's not dodging questions about Taiwan and instead dodging or ignoring critical advice from Taiwan that could have saved thousands of lives? 

As far back as December last year, the WHO refused to act on or publicize Taiwan's warning that the new respiratory infection emerging in China's Wuhan could in fact pass from human to human. 

But, in mid-January, despite accumulating evidence of patients contracting what we now know as COVID-19 from other people, the WHO repeated China's lie that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. 

In a move that contradicts its slogan of health care for all the WHO, at Beijing's command, then blocked Taiwan from participating in critical meetings to coordinate responses to the coronavirus and even reportedly provided wrong information about the virus's spread in Taiwan, essentially condemning the Taiwanese people to death for the lack of first-hand information. Politics over people. 

But, Taiwan which at its closest sits a mere 81-miles from the origin of the outbreak, China has a mere 388 cases. 

So, it's safe to say that if the WHO had listened to Taiwan instead of groveling to China for some more pocket money and doing the regime's bidding, maybe many thousands of lives would have been saved. 

Taiwan still wants to help, and the world wants to listen, but the WHO still blocks the country from its organization, the organization that we cannot allow to be used as a tool by the Chinese government, the largest financial contributor which gives five times as much money as obligated and now we know why.

People before politics and when this is all over, China and its little sidekick must be held accountable. 3986167]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Indonesian Village Uses 'Ghosts' to Scare You Into Social Distancing 3986531]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[JAVA, INDONESIA — As the British government racks its brain on how to keep facetious citizens indoors, a village in Indonesia has taken a different tactic: ghosts.
 
As reported by the BBC, the Indonesian village has reportedly taken to using volunteers dressed as ghosts to literally spook people into social distancing over the coronavirus. 

The village on Java Island started deploying the bed-sheet patrols at night last month. 

In Indonesian folklore, ghostly figures known as pocong are said to represent the trapped souls of the dead. 

According to Reuters news agency staff who traveled to see the volunteers in action, they felt the 'pocong' actually had the opposite effect as people were coming out to try and spot them. 

Despite this, locals say that matters of social distancing have since improved with the new haunting.

One resident told Reuters, Since the pocong appeared, parents and children have not left their homes. And people will not gather or stay on the streets after evening prayers.

Although slightly bizarre, this is not the only unusual measure that has been used to try to raise awareness of the disease's dangers around the world.

In India for example, police have taken to patrolling streets in virus-shaped helmets in a bid to bring attention to the dangers of the outbreak.

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAINT-DIZIER, FRANCE — A pensioner who was given a surprise flight in an $80 million fighter jet as a retirement present was flung out at 2,500 ft after accidentally pressing the ejector button.

The astonishing — what reads like a dark comedy — news story comes to us from France at an airbase in Saint-Dizier, eastern France back on March 20th, 2019.  

A new report of investigations has told how the 64-year-old French defense manufacturer had been surprised by employees at his firm, who had organized a joyride in a Dassault Rafale B jet for him as a treat after obtaining special ministerial approval.

But his friends didn't know him as well as they thought, as the unnamed man not only had no experience flying in a fighter jet, he also had no desire to rip through the sound barrier. 

But, not wanting to be rude, he reluctantly stepped up and entered the cockpit; investigators say that his smartwatch recorded his heart rate racing at 136-142 times a minute, they also noted that his heart was in full tachycardia a condition that makes your heart beat more than 100 times per minute.

As quickly as his heart was racing, they were taking off, piloted by a French veteran military pilot with more than 2,000 hours of flight time experience.

As the pilot leveled off and the plane was subjected to a negative gravitational load factor, which can create the feeling of being upside down, the passenger reached for something to hold onto, but inadvertently grabbed the ejector handle.

And yes, he was flung from the cockpit. 

But, in his panic on entering the cockpit, the man hadn't actually secured his helmet, which meant that it also flew off into infinity and beyond. 

As the pensioner hurtled towards the ground from 2,500 ft, his parachute deployed and he landed in a field, sustaining minor injuries that required him to be taken to a hospital.

The report calls on the French Airforce and the Defence Ministry to review its procedures for allowing civilians on military flights.

      <video:description><![CDATA[WUHAN — A study of COVID-19 patients in the Chinese city of Wuhan, from where the pandemic originated, found coronavirus could lead to serious neurological complications in perhaps as many as one third of all patients.

In the study of 214 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, researchers reported more than 35 percent had neurological complications, including decreased levels of cognition, stroke, and muscle damage.

Their findings, published in the journal JAMA Neurology on April 10, found 36.4 percent of those studied had neurologic symptoms. Among patients with more severe infections, 45.5 percent showed neurologic manifestations.

Separately, France's National Union of Dermatologists-Venereologists, or SNDV, has reported that certain skin dermatological conditions may possibly be associated with Covid-19 infection.

In an April 6 press release, the organization said these symptoms include appearance of pseudo-frostbite of the extremities, transient hives, and sudden onset of persistent, sometimes painful redness.

The organization recommended that patients with skin conditions of these types consult a dermatologist to rule out the possibility of COVID-19. 3986480]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China Bans COVID-19 From Games 3986967]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — Now that China is trying to stifle coronavirus research in a bid to control the narrative of its origin, Xi Jinping's far-reaching blanket of control is now trying to suffocate gaming, well, even more so than before.

We at TomoNews have come across a new game regulations notice coming out of China and you guessed it, it's targeting players, zombie-related content and that elusive COVID-19, China keeps denying a birthplace.

In a post to CK101, a forum cited a Chinese game outlet, Youxiputao, claiming that the authorities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong are about to demand that all gamers must use their actual legal names as their username; interestingly, the source also claims that they will ban all content related to zombies, pandemics or anything relating to  COVID-19, and those that use a worldwide server.

The user from the forum claims that some gamers in Animal Crossing may be accountable for these changes, as they used the game to create politically sensitive images and slogans about pro-democracy.

In principle, mini-games and console games require real-name authentication by the operating platform.

Illegal advertisements shall not be implanted in games, such as the promotion of unapproved game advertisements, if found, they shall be held accountable according to the law.

These two points here essentially shut down an anonymous gamer posting unapproved content, such as the promotion of free speech, democracy or any message for that matter that Xi hasn't already preapproved. 

But what about those terrifying zombies and mentions of COVD-19 that China is trying so hard to deny responsibility for?

No zombies, plagues or other themes corresponding to the Wuhan pneumonia epidemic should be allowed in the game, to ensure that the game chat does not allow inappropriate comments.

      <video:description><![CDATA[SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA — A new study published in Nature suggests the tidal forces that formed Oumuamua may have caused its erratic behavior.

Since its discovery in 2017, the cigar-shaped space object has flummoxed scientists with its odd shape and acceleration movements that gravity effects cannot explain.

Writing in a news release, researchers say that Oumuamua's parent body or bodies may have had a close encounter with a host star.

They say computer models show the tidal forces from stars could rip the parent body apart and turn the original object into an elongated field of debris.

The fragments may have then melted under the intense heat near the star before condescending again to form the strange cigar shape of Oumumua.

Additionally, water-ice could be trapped under Oumuamua's surface. As the object makes its passage through the solar system, the ice could be vaporized and converted to thrust, which gives Oumuamua its gravity-defying accelerations. 3986919]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Scientists spot new ozone hole in the Arctic 3986836]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[COLOGNE, GERMANY — Researchers have discovered an unusually large hole in the ozone layer above the Arctic.  

According to observations from the European Space Agency, a new ozone hole has been spotted above the Arctic. The hole covers less than 1 million square kilometers. The Antarctic hole, on the other hand, can extend to around 20 to 25 million square kilometers.

The ESA explains that during this polar winter, strong westerly winds from the polar vortex trapped cold air over the North Pole.

When the polar winter ended, the heat from the first sunlight over the Arctic triggered ozone depletion, causing this unusual mini-hole to form.

This type of ozone hole formation is different from that of the Antarctic ozone hole which appears every year due to extremely cold temperatures and pollution derived from human activity. 3986836]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[The coronavirus has already mutated into three types 3987416]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, UNITED KINGDOM — Researchers from the University of Cambridge and Germany have used RNA analysis to identify three types of COVID-19 that evolved during the early stages of the pandemic. This study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Citing the team, the University of Cambridge writes in a news release that COVID-19 type A is the original human virus genome from the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Mutated versions of type A were discovered in U.S. nationals who reportedly lived in Wuhan. Large numbers of type A virus were also seen in patients living in the U.S. and Australia.

Strangely, the dominant variant in Wuhan was type B, which was prevalent across East Asia, but did not spread much beyond the region. This means either a complex founding event happened in Wuhan, or some factors had resisted type B outside East Asia.

Type C is the main COVID-19 variant in Europe. The presence of type C was detected in early cases from France, Italy, Sweden and England, yet this variant was absent in samples from patients in Mainland China. 3987416]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GUANGZHOU, CHINA — McDonald's was forced to apologize after a video went viral showing a laminated sign posted in one of its Chinese restaurants.

The sign read, Notice: We've been informed that from now on black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant.

McDonald's spokeswoman, Regina Hui said last Saturday, McDonald's China apologizes unreservedly to the individual and our customers.

McDonald's has since pledged to use the sign incident to, further educate managers and employees on our values, which includes serving all members of the communities in which we operate.

McDonald's removed the sign, closed down the location and issued a statement that the sign was not representative of our inclusive values.

The sign is merely one instance of increasing racism in the city, as Chinese citizens have blamed African natives for spreading the coronavirus. 

Guangzhou has China's largest African community of about 4,500 individuals and according to the Washington Post, over the past two weeks African residents say they've faced forced evictions, rejections from hotels, involuntary testing without results and sequestration into two-week long quarantines even if they test negative for the virus, haven't recently traveled or had no contact with any individuals known to be infected with COVID-19.

      <video:description><![CDATA[SINGAPORE — According to Singapore's The Strait Times, COVID-19 has an infection number between 2 and 3 globally, meaning each patient infects two or three more people.

The newspaper reports the infection number in the city-state has dropped to 1 since the government-ordered lockdown on April 8, citing Alex Cook, associate professor of public health at the National University of Singapore.

By limiting exposure to carriers, social distancing could slow the spread of COVID-19, even if the biological factors remain hard to tackle.

Cook was cited as saying Singapore's confirmed cases have risen to 1,481 as of April 7.

      <video:title><![CDATA[VIRAL: BBC Weatherman Rocks News With His Drum Rendition 3987252]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM — BBC's, Owain Wyn Evans, a self-labeled unapologetically flamboyant weatherman has gone viral for his drum kit rendition of the BBC News outro. 

Trending on Twitter with over three million views, the 36-year-old weather presenter who fronts North West Tonight in the U.K, rocked out on the skins and cymbals while still donning his camera-ready three-piece suit and Elton-John-esque brooch.

The video, although brief, has given people a much-needed smile amid the coronavirus, receiving almost 122,000 'likes' and 28,000 retweets so far to date; in his Twitter caption, he joked, When they said try working from home I didn't realize they'd expect me to do the music too.

Not surprisingly, fans have called for an encore, demanding that his beats replace the shows normal outro. 

One person on Twitter even went so far as to name him a national treasure.

BBC North West also took to the social media site to lay claim to their star, boosting about their forecaster's talents and challenged other staff to step up to the drums.  

Saying, North West weather forecasters are so much more talented than the Northern Irish ones… unless you can prove otherwise!

Barra Best, a weather presenter on BBC Northern Ireland, replied saying, I concede defeat.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Taiwan is working on a social distancing app to fight COVID-19 3987214]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPEI — Taiwan is working on a social distancing app that people can download on a voluntary basis to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, a cabinet official said on April 11.

In an article published by Taiwan's Central News Agency, Chien Hung-wei, director of the Executive Yuan's Department of Cyber Security, said the social distancing app uses Bluetooth to keep track of when the user gets close to other people. 

The app will issue an alert each time the user gets too close to someone else. It will also provide data on how often the user came too close to others during each day. 

Chien said the app's primary purpose is to provide users with information about crowded places so that they can avoid them.

The app is currently being tested and will be released within the next two weeks. Use of the app will be voluntary and data will be encrypted and saved in the user's device and will not be collected to track the user's movements, Chien said.

Social distancing guidelines from Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center advise people to stay at least one meter apart outdoors and 1.5 meters apart indoors. 3987214]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[UK Spent $20 Million on Dud Chinese Coronavirus Test Kits 3987793]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM — The U.K government is scrambling for a refund after gambling on $20 million worth of Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits that did not work.

According to the New York Times, the two Chinese companies were offering a risky proposition: two million home test kits said to detect coronavirus antibodies for at least $20 million, take it or leave it. 

The asking price was high, the technology was unproven and the money had to be paid upfront; furthermore, the buyer would be required to pick up the crate loads of test kits from a facility in China.

Despite the risk, Downing Street, desperate to get a handle on the forever climbing case numbers in the U.K, gambled and handed over the cash to both 'AllTest Biotech' and 'Wondfo Biotech', the two Chinese companies in question; both of which claim that their products met the health, safety and environmental standards set by the European Union.  

Whilst public health officials reviewed the specifications on paper, diplomats were dispatched in China to ensure the companies existed and to examine their products first-hand.

The gamble backfired as the tests, said to detect antibodies for coronavirus, did not work, according to a senior civil servant.

Finding antibody tests that work is seen as a critical stage in the battle against coronavirus.

After officials complained about the dud tests, both Chinese companies instead blamed British officials and politicians for misunderstanding or exaggerating the utility of the tests. 

Wondfo told Global Times that its product was intended only as a supplement for patients who had already tested positive for the virus. 

The U.K's amateur hour exposes how vulnerable and how desperate they are to win the war on the coronavirus, as all nations are.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Longest Animal Ever Recorded Found in the Deep Sea 3987711]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[PERTH, AUSTRALIA  — This weird looking string-creature was found off the coasts of Australia along with many other new organisms that live in the deep sea. Here's how researchers bumped into this massive sea monster.

According to a press release from the Schmidt Ocean Institute, researchers found a new submarine creature off the coast of Australia while aboard the Falkor research ship. 

The team completed twenty 4,500 meter dives and totaled over 181 hours of deep-sea exploration using a remotely operated submarine called SuBastian.

During this expedition, the marine specialists spotted a type of string-like sea creature called siphonophore Apolemia. Scientists estimated that its outer ring is roughly 46 meters long. Logan Mock-Bunting, a spokesperson for the Schmidt Ocean Institute, told Newsweek that although exact measurements are pending, its length could be over 119 meters long.

Siphonophores are related to corals and jellyfish. They are an entity made up of a connected colony of cloned zooids that work as a team to keep the siphonophore alive.

As we mentioned at the beginning of the video, the siphonophore was not the only new ocean critter they found. We leave you with some breathtaking footage of the beauty and life that occurs in the depths of our oceans. 3987711]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA —  Emergency responders save a man that was hanging off a bridge inside a trailer truck. Yes, you heard that right.  

Imagine you're peacefully driving your truck down the highway when suddenly a gust of wind pushes you to another lane and then blows you off a bridge, well, almost blows you off a bridge. Unfortunately for Suffolk truck driver Wayne Boone, he didn't have to imagine.

Citing Virginia State Police, WAVY TV 10 reports that Boone was driving his 2007 Freightliner tractor-trailer on Interstate 64 at around 8:43 a.m. when strong winds forced the vehicle to the other lane while Boone was crossing the High Rise Bridge.

By then the truck was doing its own thing. Boone had lost control of the steering wheel when he hit the side of the bridge. Next thing Boone knew, he was hanging 70 feet above Elizabeth River while inside the cab of the truck.

Thankfully, the story doesn't end there. According to Chesapeake Fire officials, Boone was successfully rescued after an emergency responder rappelled off the side of the bridge to get  Boone to safety. The story ends with Boone being taken to Sentara Hospital with a few minor injuries. 

And before you start blaming poor Boone for the windy tractor frenzy, no, he was not driving under the influence of anything. Nature just decided to play around with him a little. 3987687]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Desperate German Zoo Threatens to Feed Animals to Each Other 3987662]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN, GERMANY — A zoo in Germany has warned that it may start feeding animals to each other in a desperate bid to stay open.

Located in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, Neumunster zoo, like all the others in Germany, has been shut down since March 15th in an attempt to impede the spread of the coronavirus. 

And to stay financially afloat amid the lockdown, the Zoo's director, Verena Kaspari has said: Yes, we do have a list of animals that we would slaughter first.

Citing German outlet, Deutsche Welle, she added that non-endangered deer and goats would be first and would be fed to the zoo's eagles, lynx, and polar bear, Vitus, who is over 11 ft tall.

Kapari said, It's a worst-case scenario, we don't see it getting that way yet, but we have to think of it early enough. 

Her fears understandably stem from the potential scenario where the delivery of fish and meat is no longer available because of a lack of funds. 

Fortunately, other animal parks have offered to send fish and meat to feed her zoo's predators should it come to it, but Kaspari did note that the slaughter of some animals to feed others is standard practice at zoos, saying, We have carnivorous animals, so that's nothing new.

If the zoo is allowed to be reopened at the end of April, Kaspari estimates it will have lost $191,000 in ticket sales and donations.

      <video:description><![CDATA[HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA — A man disguised as a police officer killed at least 17 people across Nova Scotia this weekend in one of the deadliest mass shootings in Canadian history, Canada's National Post reports.

Canadian police said the suspect set fires and shot at people while dressed as a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer and driving what looked like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser.

The 12-hour rampage ended Sunday morning in a standoff at a gas station outside Halifax when the suspect was caught by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Police confirmed in a press conference Sunday evening that he was dead.

Among those people killed was Constable Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the Nova Scotia RCMP.

The suspect has been identified as 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman. According to reports, he was a denturist who collected old police cruisers and other police memorabilia.

The spree was the worst mass shooting in Canada in 30 years, surpassing the death toll of the 1989 Ecole Polytechnique massacre in Montreal. 3988740]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[NASA discovers 'most similar planet to Earth' ever found 3988707]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — A team of scientists has discovered an Earth-size exoplanet in the habitable or Goldilocks zone of its star while reviewing old data from the Kepler Space Telescope, according to a press release from NASA.

The planet, Kepler-1649c, is located 300 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus and is most similar to Earth in size and estimated temperature of all the exoplanets discovered by Kepler.

Kepler-1649c is 1.06 times the size of Earth and orbits a small red dwarf star once every 19.5 Earth days, from which it receives 75 percent of the amount of light Earth receives from the Sun. 

Scientists made the discovery while analyzing old data from Kepler. They found that previous searches with a computer algorithm had misidentified Kepler-1649c as a false positive. 

Out of all the mislabeled planets we've recovered, this one's particularly exciting, said Andrew Vanderburg, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of the paper published on April 15 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. If we hadn't looked over the algorithm's work by hand, we would have missed it.

In terms of size and likely temperature, this is the most similar planet to Earth that has ever been found with Kepler, said co-author Jeff Coughlin at the SETI Institute. It's incredible to me that we just found it now, seven years after data collection stopped on the original Kepler field. 3988707]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[WWII Veteran Raises Over $32,000,000 for the NHS 3988692]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BEDFORDSHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM — Captain Tom Moore, a 99-year-old veteran has raised more than 32 million dollars for the country's National Health Service by doing 100 laps of his garden. 

Captain Tom had initially set out to raise just $1,000 before his 100th birthday on April 30th, but he quickly smashed the target once his mission came to public attention.

1,254,102 people have so far made donations to his JustGiving page, which is still open but has previously crashed simply due to the sheer number of donations. 

With the aid of a walking frame, he completed the 100 laps of the 25-meter loop earlier than planned, on April 16th. Since then, thousands have backed petitions for the World War Two veteran to be knighted by the Queen, while children across the country have begun making him birthday cards in preparation for his big day.

Ian Lush, the chairman of NHS Charities Together said the organizations had already received over $43,000 each, with the money going towards the wellbeing of staff and helping patients connect with their families.

Speaking to BBC Radio 2 Captain Tom said the sum of money was absolutely enormous and very difficult to imagine

Captain Tom, born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, was inspired to raise the money after receiving treatment for skin cancer and a broken hip two years ago. He told the Sunday Mirror: My message to the nation right now is, tomorrow will be a good day. We will get through this and come out of it stronger, more united and ready to face any challenge together.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Uranus is leaking gas and now NASA knows all about it 3988677]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Writing in the Geophysical Research Letters, NASA says a review of Voyager 2's old data from 1986 showed that Uranus vented a giant blob of gas into space. This pocket of ionized gas, a plasma structure called plasmoid, was 400 km across and 200 km long.

According to NASA's news release, Uranus is special in that it spins almost on its side like a pig on a spit roast, while the axis of its magnetic field is offset from the spin by 60 degrees. This gives the planet's magnetic field an odd wobble that scientists cannot model.

As solar winds blasted Uranus, the bombardment pinched gas off from the far end of the field. The resulting leak was then accidentally discovered by NASA researchers who were reviewing the old magnetic data.

In the new research, scientists dialed up the reading's resolution to make a data point every two seconds. They spotted a blip in the readings that indicated the planet was making a plasmoid. 3988677]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China Implementing Orwellian Health Tracking System 3988668]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — Alibaba and Tencent will now host a new health code system that uses QR codes to indicate the health status of citizens. 

Keeping the coronavirus at bay is priority number one for China now that many cities are coming out of lockdown, but could the coronavirus just be an excuse for China (and many other countries) to become more Orwellian? Well, take a look at the mobile health system China is now implementing to track its citizens.

According to a report from CNN, apps from Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent will now host a new health code system that uses QR codes to indicate the health status of citizens. This is part of an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus now that businesses are reopening in the country. Alipay launched the new system on February 11.

Chinese nationals have to input their national identity number or passport number along with their phone number into the system. Citizens also have to share their travel history and list what symptoms they may be experiencing.

After the information is officially verified, citizens are assigned a colored QR code depending on their health status. Green QR codes mean you are safe, yellow QR codes mean you came in contact with a sick person and red means you cannot go out in public.

Several businesses in China are now placing QR codes outside their venues so clients and customers can scan and show their health status codes to employees before entering a business.

Oh, and how many people are under this system? Well, according to state-run Science and Technology Daily, Tencent's health code system has been in use in more than 300 cities since March.

To be fair, China is not the only country that's tracking its citizens amid this pandemic. According to a report published in The Guardian on March 6, people in South Korea were receiving texts with information about the whereabouts of people that had tested positive for the virus. The texts were eerily specific and, honestly, too revealing of people's personal lives.

For example, one man and his secretary were being scrutinized after it was revealed that both had tested positive for the virus after they both returned from a trip to Wuhan.

According to ZDnet, the UK is also turning to technology to control the spread of the coronavirus. British authorities have confirmed that their National Health Service is developing a voluntary contract-tracing app to help curtail the spread of the virus.

We all knew this was coming — the whole blatant civilian data mining we mean. It was a matter of when rather than if. What do you think TomoSapiens? Is all this privacy invasion going to stick around even during post-pandemic days? 3988668]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China Blocks Lawyer From Going Home Even After Prison Release 3988645]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — A prominent Chinese human rights lawyer has been barred from returning home even after his prison release two weeks ago.

Wang Quanzhang, who had taken on politically sensitive cases, such as defending activists and members of the banned religious group Falun Gong, was released on the 4th of April after serving four and a half years on the blanket charge of subversion of state power; in a trial which was conducted behind closed doors with journalists and foreign diplomats barred from the courthouse. 

On his release, his wife, Ms. Li along with rights groups fear authorities are now using the coronavirus quarantine protocol as a pretext to hold him indefinitely under de facto house arrest.

Despite their promise that he would be free-to-go after 14 days, he has still been barred from returning to Beijing; Ms. Li said, Today is the 15th day and he still can't return to Beijing.

And in spite of being a so-called 'free man' who is simply being held in quarantine, she said that Wang was only able to hold phone conversations with her under the supervision of police, who controlled the content and length of his communications.

She added that Wang had called her on Saturday, saying he was unable to go home because he had just come out and needed to get used to everything. A statement that made her question whether he was speaking of his own accord, saying This is not the Wang Quanzhang I knew.

Reported by the BBC on the 5th of April, his wife claimed that his speech was being restricted. She added that in a phone call he suspiciously said he would go to Jinan, to which she responded: Is this what a rational person would do after being separated from their wife and child for almost five years?

The executive director of Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, Francine Chan, said: The harassment, surveillance and effective house arrest of Wang Quanzhang after his 'release' vividly illustrate China's use of the pandemic to extend Wang's imprisonment in violation of Chinese and international law.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Kim Jong Un in 'Grave Danger' After Heart Surgery? 3989088]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NORTH KOREA — It is being reported that North Korea's Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un is gravely-ill after undergoing heart surgery.

The 36-year-old leader's condition is supposedly being monitored by US intelligence officials, who were told that Kim was in grave danger after the cardiovascular operation, CNN claim, citing a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the matter.

Quoting South Korean news website the Daily NK, Bloomberg reports that the infamous leader was mostly-recovered from the procedure; the website obtained the story from a single anonymous informant based in North Korea and has been unable to obtain further details on Kim's condition.

Bruce Klingner, a former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea told CNN that previous rumors about Kim being in poor health had turned out to be not true and that the country's extreme secrecy made it difficult to establish facts, saying: There have been a number of recent rumors about Kim's health. If Kim is hospitalized, it would explain why he wasn't present on the important April 15th celebrations.

Unsurprisingly, North Korea's highly-secretive government has yet to comment on Kim's alleged illness, or issue any sort of statement through its state-controlled mouthpieces.

Kim, who is known to be a chain-smoker has been shown in state media in recent months appearing at military drills and riding a white horse in a power-move display of propaganda.  

The poverty-stricken nation has reported, impossibly, no cases of COVID-19, saying, not a single person in the country has been infected. Kim's absence from the public eye may just be precautionary, or he just may be on his way out.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Iranian Instagram star is battling COVID-19 while serving time 3989054]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[TEHRAN — Fatemeh Khishvand, known as Sahar Tabar on Instagram, went viral a few years ago for her extremely photoshopped images. Now it appears she is battling coronavirus in prison. 

Khishvand made headlines a few years ago after her overly photoshopped photos that made her look like a zombie version of Angelina Jolie went viral.

In October of last year she was arrested by Iranian authorities after she went viral and accused of a list of offenses, which included blasphemy, insulting the Islamic veil, and encouraging youth to commit corruption.

Her lawyer Payam Derafshan is now asking for clemency as it appears that  Khishvand may have contracted coronavirus while detained.

Derafshan wrote an open letter to Ebrahim Reisei, the head of Iran's judiciary, explaining that the young woman had been placed in quarantine after displaying symptoms of the virus.

But if you ask Iranian authorities, all this is pure make-believe. The head of Shahr-e Rey women's prison told Iran's ISNA news agency that, The news released by the lawyer of Fatemeh Khishvand is not true and I deny it.

But Khishvand's lawyer is not backing down. Derafshan is now after judge Mohammad Moghiseh of Branch 28 of the Revolutionary Court, who has repeatedly ignored pleas from the lawyer to grant Khishvand bail. 

Unsurprisingly, after the coronavirus struck Iran judge Moghiseh has been MIA in the courthouse.

Important side note: According to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, Moghiseh has previously sentenced dissidents, minorities and even activists to long prison sentences.

Khishvand's situation seems to be dire. Derafshan told the Center for Human Rights in Iran that Khishvand is currently on a ventilator at Sina Hospital in Tehran. 3989054]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Kenya Governor Puts Hennessy in Coronavirus Care Packages 3989018]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NAIROBI, KENYA — Nairobi politician, Mike Sonko has come under fire for his so-called COVID-19 'care package' which, yes, includes the typical food staples one would expect but also alcohol. 

Sonko confirmed in a media briefing last Tuesday that his care packages include a few small bottles of the cognac, Hennessy.

Though it was his justification for its inclusion that has left people mocking, as he explained to the crowd, it's throat sanitizer.

I think from the research conducted by the World Health Organization and various organizations, it has been believed that alcohol plays a major role in killing the coronavirus.

The WHO has repeatedly stated that alcohol can weaken the health of an individual and make them more vulnerable to viruses including coronavirus.

The global CEO of Amref Health Africa shared a video of Mr. Sonko's misinformation and urged people to dump this the way you would dump your used COVID-19 mask.

Meanwhile, Hennessy has refuted through local media the claims by the Nairobi governor that its drink in particular or alcohol, in general, can ward off coronavirus contagion.

In a statement to Nairobi News, the company said: Hennessy would like to stress that the consumption of our brand or any other alcoholic beverage does not protect against the virus.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Woman's breast implants save her from gunshot 3989590]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[U.S. — Doctors believe a woman's breast implants saved her from a gunshot to the chest. 

Superman better watch out, there's someone out there who doesn't need to be superhuman to be bulletproof. Apparently, all you need is a set of really great...silicone breast implants?

This isn't fake news. A woman survived a gunshot after her chest deflected a copper jacketed 0.40 caliber bullet. Her saving grace? Her 'life-saving silicone breast implants' — that's how a case study published in Sage Journal referred to the incident. Here's what happened. 

The 30-year-old woman was walking down the street minding her own business when she suddenly felt a sharp pain and warmth in her chest. Unbeknownst to her, she had been randomly shot by a stranger who, to this day, hasn't been identified.

The woman then nonchalantly took herself to the emergency room, where perplexed doctors extracted the bullet from her chest. Turns out, her two fake friends really had her back (or her front?).

Listen to this. The bullet had entered her left breast, ricocheted on her sternum and then hit her right breast, breaking one of her ribs — and she still walked herself to the emergency room.

Maybe this should become a thing. You know, give some emergency responders a pair of girlfriends instead of having them wear bulletproof vests. It would certainly confuse the heck out of criminals.

Sadly the lady's life-saving bongo's had to be removed, but she was sent home with only a few antibiotics so she should be on her way to recovery. 3989590]]></video:description>

Citing a tweet by NASA Administer Jim Bridenstine, the New York Times reports a Falcon 9 rocket will be utilized for the mission scheduled May 27.

The Falcon 9 rocketship features a reusable second stage with nine Merlin engines.

The New York Times reports NASA's Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken will pilot the ship from the Dragon spacecraft mounted atop the first stage that will push the capsule to orbit.

The reusable first stage has one Merlin engine and it is capable of reactivating multiple times during the flight to orbit, according to SpaceX.

The Dragon spacecraft will jettison the first stage and fairings before unfurling its solar array, according to NASA.

The Dragon spacecraft has completed multiple supply missions to the ISS and completed its most recent run in March.

According to Space.com, Demo-2 will be the first mission for Dragon to dock itself, instead of relying on robotic arm capture. 3989547]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA — The Royal Canadian Mounted Police say the death toll from the Nova Scotia mass shooting that occurred from Saturday to Sunday has risen to 19.

Citing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the National Post reports that 51-year-old suspect Gabriel Wortman had masqueraded as a police constable and utilized various firearms in the killing spree.

The police did not disclose the type of weapons used.

The 12-hour rampage started in the rural town of Portapique on Saturday evening. Wortman initially drove a detailed replica of a mounted police cruiser.

The suspect committed murders at no fewer than 16 locations before being cornered and shot dead by police at a gas station near Halifax. By that time, he had obtained another silver SUV via unknown means.

As multiple buildings and cars were set ablaze, possibly by Wortman, the RMCP say they are still recovering and counting the dead.

The police say the crimes appear to be, at least in part, very random in nature, but added that Wortman did have a connection with some victims.

Constable Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the Nova Scotia RCMP; elementary school teacher Lisa McCully; and the suspect Wortman were among the 19 slain, a number the police say will almost certainly increase. 

RCMP Constable Chad Morrison was shot in a confrontation with the suspect but he is currently recovering at home. 3989498]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MADRID, SPAIN — A video from Spain has surfaced showing a group of hero residents rescuing a pensioner who was dangling from a second-floor balcony. 

The neighbors were filmed banding together to create a human chain after a 70-year-old man was hanging from his flat in San Jose, on the outskirts of Madrid.

Citing local media, the man named Juan Pena was eventually lowered safely to the mattress, however, it's currently unclear why he was hanging from the balcony; 
nonetheless, the local media report that he was not injured.

The video posted to Twitter on the 19th of April has so-far received nearly 500,000 views and has been met with a series of applause.

      <video:title><![CDATA[More minorities dying due to COVID-19 in the U.S. 3989347]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Minorities in the United States are being disproportionately affected by the spread of coronavirus due to economic disparities and lack of data collection.

According to Politico, black and brown American communities are being heavily affected by the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. In addition, not enough information on the spread in these communities is being collected, affecting efforts to ameliorate the situation.

Five Florida counties stated that African American and Latino patients infected with coronavirus are being hospitalized and, at times, dying at faster rates than white patients.

According to a statement from Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a little more than 70 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the state were from African American patients.

However, not all information related to the testing and treatment of these minorities is being released, making it difficult for authorities to provide proper help to curtail the spread of the virus in these communities.

Fewer individuals belonging to these groups have access to health insurance, further exacerbating the lack of information.

Data collected by doctors at the universities of Virginia and Pittsburgh, in collaboration with data-tracking firm Rubix, indicate that although thousands of individuals belonging to these minorities presented symptoms of coronavirus, they were not receiving testing. 3989347]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Nigerian Man Fires Machine Gun at People From Balcony 3989791]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[KENT, UNITED KINGDOM — A Nigerian man has been arrested on suspicion of firearms offenses after reports he opened fire from a penthouse balcony in Chatham, Kent.

The gunman, identified as 33-year-old Michael Alunomoh, streamed himself on Instagram on the 22nd of April firing shots from his balcony at panicked shoppers while rapping to Tupac.

People at a nearby shopping center raced for cover fearful that the incident could be a terrorist attack.

Kent Police were called at 8:35 am after around 50 shots were fired where he then posted a clip of himself wielding guns and demanding onlookers to call the police; armed officers and a police helicopter raced to the scene.

One of his neighbors, 64-year-old Christine Tugman, said that he was shouting at officers, saying: Shoot me, shoot me, kill me, kill me. 

Mr. Alunomoh who calls himself 'flexingmike' on his social media pages, is listed as the chief executive of Truth or Dare Records, according to company records. The businessman is something of an online 'influencer' as he posts photos of exotic holidays and designer clothes to his 57,000 social media followers 

Earlier in the week, he promoted his new EP on Instagram which featured five songs; his social media then fell silent until yesterday morning's rampage.

A Kent Police spokesman said that the man was arrested on suspicion of firearms offenses and that, 'Patrols remain at the scene where officers have located four suspected imitation firearms as part of their inquiries.

The weapons that were found in the flat are believed to be imitation firearms and not capable of firing live ammunition.

No injuries have been reported.

      <video:title><![CDATA[COVID toes: Potential new coronavirus symptom 3990329]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[U.S. — American health professionals have observed a new potential coronavirus symptom that appears in the toes of those infected.

According to USA Today, some health professionals treating COVID-19 have noticed purple and blue lesions on the toes of coronavirus patients. This symptom is now being referred to as 'COVID toes' and can often be observed in patients with severe flu or viral pneumonia.

Ebbing Lautenbach, chief of infectious disease at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine, told USA Today that the symptom could be an inflammatory reaction to an infection in an individual's feet, or a clot in the toes' blood vessels.

Lautenbach said patients exhibiting this symptom tend to be children or young adults who are otherwise asymptomatic and would probably test negative for COVID-19 as the infection is in its early stages.

However, Susan Wilcox, Massachusetts General Hospital's chief of critical care for the emergency department, told USA Today that she mostly observed 'COVID toes' in the most severe cases she was treating.

Doctors around the world have also observed other dermatological symptoms related to COVID-19.

In an April 6 press release, France's National Union of Dermatologists-Venereologists reported that certain dermatological conditions could be related to COVID-19.These include the appearance of pseudo-frostbite of the extremities, transient hives, and sudden onset of persistent, sometimes painful redness. 3990329]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — A huge asteroid classified as potentially hazardous by NASA will streak past our planet on April 29, accordoing to NASA's Asteroid Watch.

Asteroid 52768, also known as 1998 OR2, is estimated by NASA to be between 1.8 to 4.1 kilometers wide. 

It takes Asteroid 1998 OR2 three years and eight months to orbit our Sun. Its journey takes it near Jupiter at its furthest point, but just outside Earth's farthest distance from the Sun on its closest approach.

On April 29 it will pass Earth at a distance that is more than 16 times the average distance between Earth and the Moon.

According to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, as of April 21, some 22,582 near-Earth objects had been discovered. 

The latest data on the center's website shows that 9,085 of these were 140 meters or larger in size, and 902 were estimated to be larger than one kilometer.

By comparison, the Chicxulub asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs is estimated to have been 11 to 81 kilometres in diameter. 3990273]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA["I Faked Having Covid-19 on Facebook and Got Arrested" 3990251]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[TYLER COUNTY, TEXAS — An East Texas man was arrested after he claimed he had tested positive for COVID-19 on social media.

23-year-old Michael Lane Brandin knew his Facebook post would cause a stir, but what he didn't realize was that he'd be arrested, lose his job and face a trial that could see him behind bars.

Faced with the coronavirus dominating headlines, Brandin decided to, in his own words, do a social experiment.

On March 13th he posted that he'd tested positive for coronavirus and then he added that doctors had told him that the virus was now airborne.

But he had made it all up. 
 
To justify his actions, he said the point was to demonstrate that you can't always believe everything you read online.

On Facebook, he was met with sympathy and shock, saying I had quite a few reactions. A lot of friends messaged me to ask if I was OK, so I told them that it was fake.

But whilst he explained away his fake post to worried friends, what he didn't realize was that what was happening offline became far more serious as his fake news spread like wildfire across Tyler County, in Texas, where he lived.

This was days before any lockdown had been brought in, but anxious people began to call the local hospital and ask if the news was true: how could they now protect themselves from an airborne invisible killer?

So, the police got involved, told him to amend his post, and Brandin did.

Unfortunately, it was too little too late, as the next post to appear on Facebook was from the Tyler County Sheriff's Office who said that Brandin was now facing the criminal allegation of false alarm. 

Faced with the inevitable, he turned himself in. 

After a night in the cells, he was released on condition of paying a $1,000 bail bond and is now waiting for his trial to start.

But staying true to his justification, he said: I have a bachelor of science degree in mass communications.

 I did it to prove how easy it is for anyone to post something online and cause panic.

I wanted to prove that it is important for people to be educated and do their own research before assuming everything they read or hear is true.

But because of a Facebook post, I lost my job, my health benefits. I couldn't start my master's program on time due to not having the money.

It has put a financial burden on my entire family because they are all trying to help me pay my bills.

      <video:title><![CDATA[VACCINE: Chinese Researchers Protect Monkeys From Virus 3990215]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — The vaccine race is on and Chinese researchers may have a head start after they claim they have successfully protected monkeys with a coronavirus vaccine.

According to a study published recently in the preprint server bioRxiv, scientists at Sinovac Biotech, a private Beijing based company, subjected eight rhesus macaque monkeys to two versions of its vaccine.

Three weeks later when the monkeys were exposed to the deadly pathogen, none developed a full-blown infection.

In contrast, four control animals developed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 in several body parts and severe pneumonia.

Despite the limitations of the trail, Sinovac's senior director, Meng Weining told Science Magazine that the results give us a lot of confidence that the vaccine will work in humans.

The monkeys given the largest dose of the vaccine had the best response, as researchers were unable to detect the virus in any of their pharynxes or lungs. Monkeys that received a lower dose developed a minor infection in which they appear to have been able to control.

Impressively, the researchers even claimed that the vaccine neutralized the strains of the virus isolated from coronavirus patients in China, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

Acknowledging that monkeys with the virus don't actually develop the most severe symptoms seen in humans, the researchers said, it's still too early to define the best animal model for studying SARS-CoV-2.

Sinovac is no stranger to developing vaccines, having marketed vaccines for hand, foot, and mouth disease; hepatitis A and B; and the bird flu.

      <video:description><![CDATA[OXFORD, ENGLAND — The University of Oxford has initiated human trials for the first COVID-19 vaccine in Europe, according to the BBC.

Citing the university, BBC reports on April 23 that the experimental COVID-19 vaccine takes the coronavirus's genetic material and inserts the substance into adenoviruses that are responsible for the common cold.

The cold viruses are weakened so that they cannot grow inside the human body after injection. 

The modified viruses should make the human cells produce the same spike proteins that stud the surface of the coronaviruses and teach the immune system to recognize COVID-19.

When vaccine recipients actually encounter the coronavirus, their bodies' immune system would then be able to identify the threat and scramble antibodies and killer T cells to fight off the infection.

At the time of report, two volunteers have received the shot, out of around 800 recruited for the first phase human trial.

      <video:title><![CDATA[These are the cells most vulnerable to the coronavirus 3991318]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS — A new research study details what cells are more susceptible to the coronavirus. Here's what you need to know.

According to research published in the journals Nature and Cell, specialists from around the world have identified cells in the lungs, nasal passages and intestine that are most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

Findings of the research show that secretory cells, which produce mucus in the nasal passages, have the RNAs for both proteins that COVID-19 searches for to attack a cell.

Results also suggest that the coronavirus could have mutated to attack interferon, which are proteins released by cells to fight off viruses and infections.

Researchers also found that cells in the intestine that are in charge of partial nutrient absorption called enterocytes also express the RNAs for two proteins, which makes them vulnerable to the coronavirus.

Scientists working on the study hope that these new findings will help specialists working on drug treatments for COVID-19.

In a press release published in MIT news, Alex K. Shalek, the Pfizer-Laubach Career Development Associate Professor of Chemistry said, Our goal is to get information out to the community and to share data as soon as is humanly possible so that we can help accelerate ongoing efforts in the scientific and medical communities. 3991318]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Woman Gets 3 Years for Impersonating an FBI Agent 3991263]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MONROE, NORTH CAROLINA — A woman has been sentenced to three years in prison for posing as an FBI agent on a dating website and illegally having a gun.

U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray announced last Thursday that 39-year-old, Riane Leigh Brownlee had been sentenced to 37 months for impersonating an FBI agent and illegally possessing a firearm.

Desperate to find love, Brownlee, who is also known as Raine Leigh Webb, posted a series of 'side-facing-snaps' on dating websites, showing off her fake FBI badge and firearm. 

On February 23rd, 2019 when Brownlee was on a date, she reportedly told the person that she was an FBI agent conducting a counter-drug operation. 

After Brownlee was arrested later the same day, she falsely told the same person that she had to keep her identity secret from law enforcement because she was operating undercover.

Court records show that, in addition to the fake FBI badge, law enforcement recovered a stolen loaded gun from the stolen vehicle Brownlee was driving.

To top it all off, authorities also recovered a fake FBI ID bearing Brownlee's picture and the name FBI Special Agent Alexandria Mancini.

She has multiple prior felony convictions, including identity theft, felony worthless checks, and possession of a stolen motor vehicle, she is also prohibited from possessing a firearm or ammunition.

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — A hot mic in the White House briefing room captured a conversation between Fox News reporter John Roberts and New York Times photographer Doug Mills saying that everyone around here has, 'been vaccinated.' 

The video from last Monday's White House coronavirus task force briefing has sparked controversy and has since gone viral.

Mediaite, who was first to report on the video, stated that when White House briefings are streamed live, some outlets carry the feeds — with audio and video —  long before the events start.

Roberts is heard saying, 'You can take off the mask, the case fatality rate is 0.1 to 0.3 according to USC.'

Mills then apparently jokes, 'Everyone's been vaccinated around here anyway.' 

Roberts is also heard quoting statistics, saying, 'USC and LA County public health came out with a study that found that there are 7,000 cases in California but they really believe there are anywhere from 221,000 to 442,000 people who are infected.'

      <video:title><![CDATA[Dozens of 'Covidiots' Protested on Anzac Day 3991559]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA — Dozens of protestors in Australia hijacked Anzac Day to demonstrate against coronavirus restrictions.

On Saturday 25th, around 75 demonstrators, including ex-servicemen and women, stood shoulder to shoulder in a park at Trafalgar Train Station in West Gippsland, Victoria calling for an end to the lockdown. 

They claimed the government had gone too far in imposing rules on what the locals can do amid the pandemic, even going so far as to compare the government to Nazi Germany.

Some placards read 'what did our Anzacs die for?', 'locking up healthy people is tyranny' and 'give our jobs back.'

Many of the demonstrators served or were related to people who served for their country and frustrations grew from the inability to be able to honor them due to social distancing. 

Ex-serviceman, Topher Field, the individual responsible for leading the event said the government's restrictions had taken freedom away from Australians.

He said in a live stream video of the protest, Who would have thought in our own free country we would have to risk fines to gather and honor Anzac Day.

Despite four police cars present, the protest continued for more than an hour. A Victoria Police spokesperson told Australian outlet, 7NEWS that officers attended a demonstration but no infringements were issued.

She added, However, investigations continue and police will be issuing fines to the organizers.

Since the video went viral, the protestors have been slammed by many as disrespectful.

One woman wrote, Actually shaking with rage over this right now. While people all over the country were holding peaceful driveway vigils this morning, these absolute stains decided that the ANZACs apparently fought for their right to spread disease to small regional towns.

Lastly, Victoria has imposed the harshest coronavirus restrictions in Australia. On the spot fines of $1,652 have been given to anyone breaking coronavirus regulations which require people to stay inside unless leaving for work and education, exercise, food shopping, care reasons, and other extenuating circumstances.

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT — Using the Extreme Precision Spectrometer, or EXPRES, a team of multinational scientists were able to look more closely into the environment of MASCARA-2 b, a large, scorching hot gaseous planet in our galaxy, Yale News reports.

MASCARA-2 b is a gas giant twice the size of Jupiter located 140 parsecs, or 4.3 quadrillion kilometers, away from Earth.

MASCARA-2 b is just 8 million kilometers away from its sun, making its atmosphere reach temperatures of more than 1726.6 degrees Celsius.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Politician Quits After Tossing His Cat in Zoom Meeting 3992065]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[VALLEJO, CALIFORNIA — The coronavirus has inadvertently thrown Zoom — the video conference app — into the spotlight, but recently, all for the wrong reasons.

You see, as more and more companies rely on the platform to keep their human cogs churning, the chances only increase that sooner or later someone screws up for all to see. 

This is Chris Platzer, a planning commissioner from California's Vallejo and he's made headlines for launching his cat off-screen. 

In the now-viral video of the Planning Commission teleconference on April 20th, Platzer says, 'I'd like to introduce my cat' and then, out of nowhere, tosses his kitty off-screen.

The Times-Herald reported that the planning commissioner was also spotted taking sips from a green bottle; and in the original footage released by the Northern California city, he was also heard making degrading comments, 'I'm going to call bullsh** on you little bit**s.'

Just in time before the City Council was set to remove him from his post, Platzer sent an email on Saturday, saying he had stepped down from the seven-person panel.

'I did not conduct myself in the Zoom meeting in a manner befitting of a planning commissioner and apologize for any harm I may have inflicted.'

'I serve at the pleasure of the council and no longer have that trust and backing. I extend my gratitude to those who have supported me during my tenure. I have always felt that serving Vallejo in a voluntary position is honorable because Vallejo is worth serving. We are all living in uncertain times and I certainly, like many of you, am adjusting to a new normalcy.'

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Direct sunlight and high humidity can kill the coronavirus in minutes, according to new research announced on April 24 by a senior U.S. official in a press conference with President Donald Trump.

A summary of research from the Department of Homeland Security found that when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity, the coronavirus' half-life, or rate of decay, was 18 hours on a nonporous surface. 

When humidity was raised to 80 percent, the halflife fell to six hours. When sunlight was added, the half-life dropped to just two minutes. 

When the virus was aerosolized in droplets that hang in the air, its half-life was one hour when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity. When sunlight was added to the equation, its half-life was only one-and-a-half minutes. 

The new research was announced to reporters at the White House by William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary, who displayed the information on slides.

The study, which was carried out by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland, has not yet been released for review and is still awaiting external evaluation.

Bryan's summary of the research leaves many questions unanswered, such as the intensity and wavelength of the ultraviolet light used in the experiment.

In a statement sent to CNN, the Illuminating Engineering Society, a non-profit industry group, said, Ultraviolet disinfecting 'wands' or other ultraviolet products for residential use — as they are inadequately proven and unregulated — may pose a safety hazard and are unlikely to provide the protection expected. 3991936]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[COVID-19 Outbreak Now Affecting Meat Industry 3991917]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — The spread of coronavirus among employees in meat factories is forcing several meat production plants in the U.S. to shut down.

A report by the Associated Press explains that efforts from the meat industry in the United States to curtail the spread of the virus among their employees have resulted in slower meat production which will eventually result in less meat in the market and higher prices for the meat that is available.

Pork production has been the most affected. According to the report, 15 of America's largest pork-packaging plants are responsible for 60 percent of all processed pork produced in the U.S.

This means that when one shuts down, overall pork production is severely affected. As of last week, pork processing capacity has dropped 25 percent.

The Associated Press reports the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects beef to rise in price by between one to two percent, poultry by 1.5 percent and pork between two and three percent. 3991917]]></video:description>
