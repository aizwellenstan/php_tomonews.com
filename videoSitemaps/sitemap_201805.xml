      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT — Keeping the mind alive outside the body may not just be science fiction anymore.

According to MIT Technology Review, Yale neuroscientist Nenad Sestan claims he's pioneered a way to keep animal brains alive for 36 hours after detaching them from the body.

After obtaining more than a hundred pigs' brains from a slaughterhouse, he and his team restored circulation within four hours.

To do so, they used a system called BrainEx, which warms artificial blood to body temperature and pumps it right into the brain.

Despite detecting no electrical activity, and finding brain waves similar to that of a person in a coma, the individual brain cells were surprisingly healthy and capable of normal activity. So not quite conscious, but still very much alive.

Theoretically, the researchers say the technique could work on other species, like primates or even humans.

But before that even happens, scientists will need to talk long and hard about ethics, since this is a road that can get weird and problematic very quickly. 3601883]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHENGDU, CHINA — A giant insect, said to be the world's biggest mosquito, discovered in southwestern China last August will be in display at a museum next month. 

Reported by China's Xinhua News, entomologist Zhao Li[c] discovered the giant critter at Qingcheng mountain in China's Sichuan province last August. 

Zhao, who's also a curator for the Insect Museum of West China, told local media Sichuan Online that the mosquito, 

Holorusia mikado, also known as the crane fly, belongs to the world's largest mosquito species Holorusia and has a 5cm long body and a wingspan of 11.15cm.

First discovered and named by British entomologist John Westwood in Japan in 1876, the mosquito is said to be the largest of the mosquitoes with an average wingspan of 8cm.

In the western parts of Sichuan, are mainly found in the Chengdu plain and in mountainous areas below 2,200 metres.

Zhao Li said despite the flies' horrific look, they do not feed on blood. The adults have a lifespan of only a few days and mainly feed on nectar, 

The crane fly will now go on display at Zhao's museum as part of an exhibition about strange insects in May. 3601874]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Restaurant named 'Yellow Fever' sparks outrage online 3601774]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA — A Whole Foods in Long Beach has partnered up with a controversially-named Asian restaurant that has most people on social media shookt.

According to Dallas News, 'Yellow Fever' sells rice and noodle bowls and is supposedly like an Asian Chipotle — though you really wouldn't know it from the name.

Netizens went nuclear on Wednesday after Whole Foods 365 announced the opening on Twitter, hurling accusations that its name is both racist and unappetizing.

The term has been used to describe a white person with an Asian fetish, but scientifically, it refers to a deadly mosquito-borne disease that causes jaundice or yellowing of the skin and eyes.

Owner Kelly Kim didn't want her restaurant to have a stereotypical Asian name, nixing anything that included bamboo, lotus, or dragon. When 'Yellow Fever' came to mind, she thought it was cheeky enough to be memorable.

She also says it's a way for her to reclaim the term and reinterpret it positively, but not everyone is buying it.

Kim says she's sticking to the name though. And as to whether it's racist — we'll let you decide. 3601774]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[DALLAS, TEXAS — The family of a woman who died after a mid flight medical emergency on American Airlines is now suing the carrier for negligence.

According to federal court documents, the incident occurred while newlyweds Brittany and Cory Oswell were flying from Honolulu to Dallas Fort-Worth in April 2016.

Three hours into the flight, Brittany became dizzy and disoriented— slurring her speech before suddenly fainting. A doctor on the plane who checked on her initially thought she was having a panic attack.

About one to three hours later, the 25-year-old went to the lavatory, and was discovered lying on the floor after vomiting and soiling herself. 

After examining her again, the doctor told the flight crew several times to land the plane at the nearest airport so Brittany could get medical help.

The plane could have diverted to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but instead it continued on for another 90 minutes to Dallas.

During this time, Brittany's breathing and pulse stopped. The doctor tried to use a defibrillator, but it turned out to be faulty. She never regained consciousness, and spent three days on full life support at Baylor Medical Center, before being taken off and declared dead on April 18.

Doctors determined she had a blood clot in her lung, and stated cause of death as acute massive pulmonary embolism and cardiogenic shock.

Her family is seeking damages for their loss, believing the airline is at fault for not diverting the plane, and for the faulty medical equipment onboard. 3601767]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MELBOURNE — More than 500 students and professors were evacuated from a Melbourne college over a suspected gas leak. 

The putrid panic was started when students and staff in a library building reported smelling gas. They were then evacuated by the local police force.  

After an extensive search of the building for the gas leak, firefighters discovered the stank was actually coming from a rotten durian left in a cupboard.  
According to the BBC, firefighters said the fantastic aroma spread through the building via the A/C. 
For those unfamiliar with the tropical fruit, the smell can be bit pungent. And it does smell a bit like gas —- but farty gas though. 

According to the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade the building has been all cleared. Although that rotten, dirty gym sock smell may linger for a bit while longer. 3601741]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[RICHMOND, VIRGINIA — A blind dachshund in Richmond, Virginia recently reunited with his best friend guide dog after the pair was forced to be split up.

According to Richmond Animal Control Center, 6-year-old pit bull Blue Dozer and 12-year-old dachshund OJ were given to the animal shelter because the owner became homeless and could no longer provide proper care to the dogs.

It was obvious to the shelter staff the duo is bonded for life, also because OJ is visually-impaired and has to depend on Blue Dozer to show him the way.

Luckily, someone adopted the pair, however, OJ the blind dachshund was abandoned just days after the adoption. 

OJ was then rescued by the Shenandoah Valley Animal Services Center.

The animal service center told NBC12 that the person who adopted the dogs said she is not interested in keeping OJ because he bites.

Fortunately, she eventually decided to give Dozer up so he and OJ could hopefully be adopted together. The pair were then reunited, and they couldn't have been happier.

Determined to find a new forever home for the duo, the shelter posted about the pair on Facebook and emphasized that they needed to be adopted together. 3601564]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ISTANBUL — An American woman soloed child birth last month in a Turkish hotel room using a bathtub, YouTube videos and a whole lot more.

U.S. Air Force analyst Tia Freeman told the world about her amazing story on her Twitter account this week. The the 22-year-old said she was traveling to Germany via Istanbul, Turkey when she began having stomach pain due to what she believed to be food poisoning, reported Newsweek. 

Freeman was very pregnant at the time and only found about that mid-January, but the Germany trip was booked beforehand. The Nashville woman powered through her flight until she arrived at Istanbul airport where she was greeted with a massively busy customs area.

Somehow she made it to her hotel while she was in labor. And not knowing the emergency number or local lingo, she searched YouTube for how to deliver a baby.  
Freeman decided for a water birth. So she filled the tub with warm water, got into position, bit into a towel and started to PUSH!

Freeman named her son Xavier Ata Freeman. Now back in the U.S., Freeman told BuzzFeed that she and Xavier are doing great and he's being spoiled by her family. 3601507]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WOODS CROSS, UTAH — The pitchforks are are it again on social media, this time over a Utah teen's choice of prom dress.

When Keziah Daum tweeted photos of her in a red and gold cheongsam, she didn't realize it was going to blow up the internet.

The 18-year-old told Insider she spotted the beautiful dress at a thrift store and decided to wear it to senior prom.

Over the next week, the teen's tweet went viral, but for all the wrong reasons. 

Commenters criticized her for wearing the dress when she wasn't even remotely Asian, and didn't know its history or significance, basically accusing her of cultural appropriation.

Others weren't bothered by the dress, but did find certain poses made by the teen and her friends to be inappropriate.

Daum has since responded to her haters, denying any wrongdoing and claiming the poses meant something else entirely. She defended the photos as her show of love and appreciation for Chinese culture and says she won't be taking them down. 3602547]]></video:description>

Luckily no one was hurt in the crash that took place in the Huffman area, including the cow, but a few people did have to scramble to get away from it. 

There is no word on whether the cow has been found. 

Harris County Precinct 3 Constable Sherman Eagleton posted the dashcam video on Facebook, said it was another day in the life of his department, which often encounters the good, the bad and the big. 3602504]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — An award-winning wildlife photo has been revealed as a hoax, according to a news release from the Natural History Museum.

The image of an anteater in Brazil's Emas National Park won Wildlife Photographer of the Year in 2017 but it turns out it was too good to be true. According to organizers of the competitions, London's Natural History Museum, the image is a hoax. 

Anonymous sources questioned the photo's legitimacy in March, prompting the museum to investigate further. Experts deduced that the anteater in question is a stuffed one taken from the visitor center in Emas National Park.

The museum says experts investigating the hoax concluded that the animal's posture, morphology raised tufts of fur and patterns on the neck and were are all too similar to be different.

Marcio Cabral, the photographer of the image, maintains that the anteater was real and says he even has a witness. The museum disqualified Cabral from the prize, removed his name from the exhibition and say he won't be able to enter future contests. 3602468]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[OREGON — Truck driver Jacob Cartwright is lucky to be alive after getting lost for four days in the woods delivering a truckload of potato chips.

According to KATU, Cartwright was driving from Portland to Nyssa, Oregon to make a 7:30 a.m. Wednesday delivery, but his GPS sent him down the wrong road. 

According to Oregon State Police, Cartwright entered the incorrect address, but since he had never been there before, he didn't know if he was going the wrong way. 

In the middle of the night, the trucker finally decided to turn around, but his truck began losing traction and got stuck on a snowy muddy road. 

Cartwright then started hoofing it and walked 12-13 hours a day for the next three days. 

He finally found his way to Interstate 84, where he flagged a driver down who gave 
Cartwright a lift back to his house in La Grande, Oregon. 

The 22-year-old was taken to the hospital for dehydration and possible frostbite on his right foot. 
The craziest part of the story though is Cartwright didn't eat one single chip he was hauling. Good thing, because that stuff will really kill you. 3602454]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — The People's Republic of China is sponsoring research into technology that scans workers' brains for their emotional state.

According to the South China Morning Post, Chinese factory, military and train workers are all wearing helmets that can track their emotions. Train drivers wearing the tech get a zap if they doze off, as could pilots if the technology ever comes to planes. It is all being watched by an AI. 

According to the MIT Technology Review, the system probably doesn't work despite claims it boosted a factory's profits by over $300 million. 3602398]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TWITTERSPHERE — A copy of the legendary 'Sonic The Hedgehog 2' was mysteriously purchased by someone in March from a game store that has been carrying it since 1992.

Covered by TechNews, video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella tweeted that he was surprised to see 'Sonic The Hedge 2' for the Sega Game Gear pop up in his sales report. 

Intrigued by the phenomena, Piscatella sent out a tweet hoping people on the interweb can help him out.

A relative of the mysterious buyer retweeted Piscatella and said it was his brother-in-law who bought the game at a store in Wisconsin for just $6.99

And apparently the game was purchased in February and they thought they could play the game with their Sega Game Gear, sadly, the console didn't work properly.

According to GameRant, since its existence, the Sega Game Gear totaled 10.62 units in sales worldwide. It was later forced out of the video game market by Nintendo Game Boy, as it was a bigger. 3602316]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — Droves of white-haired caterpillars have invaded the British capital, with experts warning they can trigger allergic reactions in humans and pets.

The BBC reports that UK officials have issued a health warning following an outbreak of toxic caterpillars of the oak processionary moth across London and southeast England.

The species is a native of Southern Europe, but was accidentally introduced to Britain via imported live oaks in 2005.

Each caterpillar contains 62,000 hairs, which are full of spines that can prick skin. They can be released from the body and stay active for up to five years.

The hairs contain an irritating substance called thaumetopoein that can cause skin rashes, eye irritation, sore throats, and breathing difficulties.

The British Forestry Commission has begun using biopesticides to help eliminate the caterpillars, and have cautioned residents against letting children or pets near affected areas.

Traps will also be set for the invasive insects around the 150 hotspots identified by the commission. 3602307]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SEOUL — The President of South Korea is rooting for Trump to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for helping bridge the North-South divide, and no — he's not joking.

According to Business Insider, with the two Koreas now talking peace and denuclearization, President Moon Jae-In says big credit is owed to ole Donald, the same peace-loving fella who threatened North Korea with nuclear annihilation just a year ago.

Sure, the Trump administration has been hurling sanctions and insult tweets left and right, and breathing down both the North's and China's necks. But it's hard to say how much of that is actually responsible for Kim Jong-Un's renewed interest in peace — if he's even truly interested.

Seeing Trump and Nobel Peace Prize in the same sentence is mind-boggling enough, but it isn't even the worst part. 

CNN reports that former South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung won the prize in 2000 for setting up a summit with the North. His widow wished the same to Moon, who then went on to endorse Trump. 

So the possibility of Trump being awarded a Peace prize? It's pretty real. 3602262]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LAKE LOTAWANA, MISSOURI — Game Loot Network Holdings is planning to use blockchain technology to create an alternative gaming market and player reward system.

According to Digital Trends, GLN has raised $2.5 million in presales, but will hold an initial coin offering on May 29. 

The company said during a test run, they saw $5 million in transactions and had 65,000 users.  
The gaming company will use blockchain to handle transactions and its cryptocurrency, known as Loot, as part of its reward system. 
GLN will also offer a platform called Build to let independent game developers submit game ideas, story concepts and demos, which will also allow gamers to support developers using the Loot digital currency. 

GLN hopes that by using blockchain, it will help in competing with more established players in the PC and mobile-gaming market, like Steam and Apple. 3602230]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA — Step aside, Tinder, there's a new cupid in town and it's hellbent on changing users' status from single to in a relationship.

At this year's F8 developer conference, Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of a new dating feature on the Facebook app, according to CNN Money.

The dating service is opt-in, and users won't be matched with people they're already friends with. Supposedly, profiles are private and won't be visible to friends or on news feeds, but with Facebook's recent privacy scandal, let's just say we're skeptical.

When singles sign up for events, they'll get access to other attendees' dating profiles, and maybe even find someone who's not weird or creepy.

Zuckerberg claims the app is meant to foster serious, meaningful relationships instead of just hookups, though really that's up to the singles to decide.

No news yet on when the service is being rolled out, but people aren't terribly excited about it. And really, can you blame them?

You had a good thing going with the 'poke', Facebook. Should've just stuck to it. 3603106]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BIRMINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM — The idiots of the world came together at the Flat Earth Convention in England last weekend and let loose a torrent of insanity.

According to Vice, wild conspiracy theories thrown about ranged from pseudoscientific to magical to just plain bizarre.

One speaker concluded gravity doesn't exist after spending a year tracking moon movements in his backyard with a camera and phone app.

Musician Darren Nesbit hypothesized that the earth is shaped like a diamond and held up by pillars.

According to Nesbit, it's just like Pac-Man. Once you reach one end of the earth, space-time wraps around, as it does, and teleports you to the opposite end, same as what happens to the video game characters. 3603100]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[XINGUARA, BRAZIL — One woman and two teenagers are lucky to be alive after a selfie almost turned fatal in Brazil.

According to Google-translated G1 article from April 23, the trio were visiting part of an old railway bridge they often go to with several others.

The bridge in question covers the river Cais in Xinguara, a rural area of the Castelo do Piauí municipality. That's northeast Brazil, and over 1,000 miles from Rio.

The young women went into part of an area on the side of the bridge that had cracks and decided to take a selfie. That's when the bridge gave way. Reportedly, they all dropped from a height of 10 meters. All survived the fall, but received differing injuries.

One of the teenagers broke her leg and had to undergo surgery. The other teen fractured her left heel. The woman also broke her leg.  First they were treated at a local hospital, then transported 120 miles over night by ambulance overnight to another hospital for further treatment.

A hospital official said they were lucky to have landed into mud, otherwise it could've been more serious. Rail authorities told G1 the bridge is for rail use only. 3603092]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TORONTO, CANADA — People in Toronto are still scratching their heads over a strange sight — who left a car dangling from a bridge?

According to the Toronto Star, the blue sedan was found empty and without license plates hanging from the Millwood Bridge early on Wednesday morning.

Although it didn't pose any safety risks, local authorities have identified the incident as a case of mischief.

Toronto police initially thought the car was for a movie stunt, but later confirmed no filming permits had been issued.

The vehicle was safely taken down by firefighters. Local authorities have launched an investigation on the prank and asked the public to share any info in regards to it.

More questions have mounted as the investigation goes on, questions like how do you suspend a car five stories off the ground? Are parking fees really that expensive in Toronto? And, what is the meaning behind the prank? 3604021]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — A newly released video shows just how close an Air Canada flight got to other jets as it was making a landing at SFO back in July of 2017.

In the surveillance video released by National Transportation Safety Board on Wednesday, Air Canada's Airbus A-320 descended just minutes before midnight on July 7 last year. 

Although the plane was apparently cleared to land on runway 28L, but it actually lined up to land on a taxiway where several planes full of passengers were waiting to take off. 

The airbus immediately pulled up before landing on the plane-packed taxiway.

The Air Canada crew told the NTSB that something didn't look right on the runway as they prepared to land so they opted to go-around. 

The Associated Press reported that the FAA said in a report that three of the five close-calls involving aircraft reported in the past 16 months at SFO were caused by pilots.

The NTSB also revealed that a system designed to monitor ground traffic at SFO lost the inbound Air Canada aircraft for about 12 seconds, it came back to the system when the plane overflew the first waiting plane on the taxiway. 3603973]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[RUSSIA AND THE ARCTIC — A massive floating nuclear power plant is now on its way to an Arctic port, after Russia's state nuclear corporation Rosatom launched the nuclear plant over the weekend.

Russian officials say the Akademik Lomonosov is set to become the first series of floating nuclear power plants Russia plans to develop.

The portable plant is not self-propelled and must be towed to the desired location. It is designed to provide energy to port cities and offshore gas and oil-extracting platforms.

The floating nuclear power plant will be towed from St. Petersburg and around Norway to a Russian town called Murmansk to take on nuclear fuel. From Murmansk, the $232 million nuclear plant will head to the Arctic to power the oil-industry town of Pevek.

With two nuclear reactors, the nuclear plant will produce up to 70 MW[d] of electricity, enough to power a city of 100,000 inhabitants.

Rosatom says the nuclear plant is designed with the great margin of safety that exceeds all possible threats and makes nuclear reactors 'invincible' for tsunamis and other natural disasters.

Rosatom also added that the floating nuclear plant meets all the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency and do not pose any threats to the environment.

Despite such reassurances, Greenpeace nuclear expert Jan Haverkamp told Engadget that having nuclear reactors moving around the Arctic Ocean creates a obvious threat to a fragile environment which is already affected by climate change. 3603966]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[People with O blood type more likely to die from serious injury 3603881]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[TOKYO — People who have O blood type may be at higher risk of dying from serious injury, according to a study published in Critical Care on Tuesday. 

Researchers in Japan looked at the medical records of 901 severe trauma patients who visited one of two emergency critical care centers in Japan from 2013 to 2016, according to the Telegraph. 

They found patients with type O blood had a death rate of 28 percent, while the death rate of patients from other blood groups combined was 11 percent. 
Lead researcher Dr. Waturu Takayama, from Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, said recent studies suggest that blood type O could be a potential risk factor for hemorrhage. 

People with blood type O have lower levels of the blood clotting protein known as von Willebrand Factor, vWF. 

Therefore, a lower vWF level is a possible explanation for the increase in mortality in patients with blood type O, as observed in this study, researchers wrote. 
Since the study was conducted only in Japan, researchers suggested looking at results over different populations, as different countries tend to have different blood type distributions. 3603881]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CALGARY, CANADA — Canadian police are investigating a case of the body of a man was found inside a wall in a public restroom at a mall in Calgary, Canada on Monday.

According to local media Calgary Sun, a maintenance worker was called in the morning to fix a toilet on the fourth floor at the Core shopping centre in downtown Calgary. 

When the maintenance worker removed a wall panel in order to repair the toilet that would not flush, he found something unusual — the body of an adult male.

After sealing the scene and wheeling the body away, the forensics team performed an autopsy on Tuesday.

Police have not yet determined if the death is suspicious, but they said it's possible if the person was crawling through a vent or duct, fell from above and got stuck in the wall.

Police said they could not yet comment on how long the body had been behind the toilet wall as they are waiting for the results of the autopsy. 3603874]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HONOLULU — The same sunscreen that's protecting our skin is apparently harming the marine ecosystem.

The Honolulu Star Advertiser reports that Hawaii lawmakers passed a bill on Tuesday prohibiting the sale and distribution of sunscreen that contains two chemicals known to damage coral reefs.

Popular sunscreen brands like Coppertone, Banana Boat, and Hawaiian Tropic have been found to contain oxybenzone and octinoxate, which filter and absorb UV rays.

A 2015 study led by the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Virginia looked at reefs in Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Israel, and found that the chemicals caused bleaching by eliminating algae and nutrients in the coral.

According to NPR, just one drop of sunscreen is reportedly enough to damage delicate reef systems and disrupt the development of marine wildlife.

Sunscreen manufacturers and retail and health reps who oppose the ban claim banning the chemicals could leave millions vulnerable to harmful sun exposure.

The bill will need to be signed by the governor to pass into legislation. If it does, Hawaii will become the first U.S. state to enact a law of this kind, which will take effect on January 1, 2021. 3603842]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CLEVELAND, OHIO — A Southwest Airlines flight flying from Chicago to Newark on Wednesday morning diverted to Cleveland because of a window crack. 

On my way to NJ for work and #Southwest957 gets a window crack, passenger Alejandro Aguina posted over Twitter, according to USA Today. 
The aircraft was carrying 73 passengers, and no injuries were reported, the airline said in a statement. 

The twin-engine Boeing 737 took off from Chicago's Midway International Airport at 9:53 a.m. and ascended to 33,000 feet over 20 minutes, according to Flightaware.com. 
According to passenger Linda Holley, a loud noise was then heard and a large crack appeared in a window. 
The plane then diverted to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and landed at 10:46 a.m. 

There was no depressurization of the cabin, so oxygen masks were not deployed, according to FAA spokesman Greg Martin. 

The aircraft has been taken out of service as investigators try and figure out the cause of the incident. 3603771]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[OSAKA, JAPAN — More than 60 passengers were left hanging in the air for up to two hours after a roller coaster made an emergency stop Tuesday at Universal Studios in Osaka, Japan.

According to the theme park, the Jurassic Park-inspired roller coaster was launched in March 2016 over a 1,120-meter course, with the highest point being 37 meters above the ground.

Japan's Asahi Shimbun reported that, the Flying Dinosaur roller coaster's two carriages stalled midway through the 1,100-meter ride, with 64 passengers stranded upside down about 30m above the ground.

A safety mechanism was activated after detecting some abnormality, halting the operation of the roller coaster. 

Park staff guided the passengers one by one down an emergency passage; however, it took about two hours for the last passenger to be rescued.

Universal Studio Japan has apologised for the incident and said the suspension was the result of the operator's priority on safety.  

Universal Studio Japan was crowded with visitors due to Japan's Golden Week holidays starting from late April to Sunday.

Some visitors told the media about their concerns. A mother said it's scary to think if her family and her boarded the ride. Another woman who rode the ride right before the incident said the ride itself is pretty scary, so she wants park staff to operate it safely.

Apparently the incident did not discourage other thrill-seekers as many have lined up to ride the roller coaster as soon as operations resumed. 3603574]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES — Kanye West stopped by TMZ on Tuesday and gave the world a peek into the mind of a moron. While ranting about all types of nonsense, he blurted out this gem, You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sound like a choice.  

TMZ reporter Van Lathan then called Kanye out on camera, and then proceeded to drop some serious knowledge on Mr. Kardashian.  

Lathan stood up and said, I think what you're doing right now is actually the absence of thought.

While you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you've earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives. We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice.

Mr. Kim Kardashian then ran over to apologize and say sorry to Lathan for disappointing him.
But honestly, what do you expect from someone that once said, I am a proud non-reader of books. 3603355]]></video:description>

According to a study published in Nature, excavations in the Northern Philippine province of Kalinga have uncovered 57 stone tools and more than 400 animal bones from monitor lizards, deer, turtles, and the now-extinct stegodon.

Researchers also found the mostly intact skeleton of an ancient rhino species. 13 of its bones displayed cut marks, indicating it had been butchered for food.

CNN reports that the remains were dated to 709,000 years ago. Before this, the earliest indicator of human activity in the country was a 67,000-year-old foot bone uncovered at Callao Cave.

The ancients who hunted the rhino were likely an archaic human species called homo erectus that may have arrived from China via Taiwan, or from Borneo via Palawan. 

Without solid evidence, however, researchers say the hobbit-like homo floresiensis from nearby Flores island may also be a suspect.

They plan to continue excavating to hopefully find their culprit, and maybe even unlock more ancient human mysteries. 3604775]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CAMP LEMONNIER, DJIBOUTI — The U.S. has filed a formal complaint with China after pilots in Africa were targeted by unauthorized Chinese laser activity.

The Washington Post reports that the U.S. military's Camp Lemonnier base is located in Djibouti, just a few miles from China's first overseas naval base, which was opened last year.

According to Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, two pilots on a C-130 cargo plane were beamed with high-powered lasers while landing at the U.S. base, resulting in minor eye injuries.

Similar incidents had also been reported in recent weeks. Citing intelligence sources, IHS Jane's Defence Weekly reports that the Chinese navy is suspected of using the laser weapons at their base or on a ship offshore.

Reports from American pilots indicated that the lasers were of military grade, and originated from the Chinese base on at least three occasions.

The U.S. has also requested an investigation on the incidents, though Beijing has yet to respond.

Chinese military observers did tell the South China Morning Post it's possible the lasers were being used to scare off birds or spy drones, and may not have been targeting the pilots at all.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Facebook staff fired over creepy stalker Tinder messages 3604699]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SOCIAL MEDIA — Social media giant Facebook has recently fired an engineer who allegedly used his privileges to stalk women online. 

Confirmed by Techcrunch, Facebook launched an investigation into a claim made by cybersecurity expert Jackie Stokes, who said the person was a security engineer and likely using privileged access to find women.

According to the excerpt of a Tinder conversation posted by Stokes on Twitter, the engineer mentioned to a woman that he is a security analyst.

Then he told the woman that he's a professional stalker as he also tries to find out who the hackers are in real life. The professional stalker then confessed that he stalked the woman and admitting it's hard to find out what she is like in real life.

Stokes said through the man's Tinder profile, Linkedin, and Facebook's Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos's connections on encryption key directory Keybase, the man is indeed an Facebook employee. 

After the exchange was revealed, Stamos said the pro stalker was immediately fired from his fancy Silicon Valley job.

The social media giant later responded to the incident by saying that access is logged when employees request data outside their purview, and they are warned when the need for access is confirmed.

Stamos added that Facebook has strict policy controls and technical restrictions so that employees can only access certain data they need for their jobs, and said whoever abuses the controls will be fired.

The incident has become the newest case for potential abuse of user information as Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in early April that he made a huge mistake for not focusing on this aspect. 3604699]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Tick and mosquito infections spreading quickly across U.S. 3604525]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[AMERICA — The number of Americans becoming sick from mosquito, tick and flea bites has more than tripled from 2004 through 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday. 

The CDC said 96,075 diseases caused by mosquito, tick and flea bites were reported in 2016, up from 27,388 in 2004, according to Reuters.

In 2016, infections were up 73 percent from 2015 due to the emergence of Zika, a mosquito transmitted illness that causes severe birth defects. 
Zika was the most common disease carried by ticks, mosquitoes and fleas reported in 2016, with 41,680 cases, followed by 36,429 cases of Lyme disease. 

The surge in infections may be the result of global warming, with warmer temperatures and shorter winters boosting mosquito, tick and flea populations. 

According to the CDC, the increases in cases are due to several factors, including growing insect populations that transmit the diseases and increased exposure to U.S. travelers abroad, who unknowingly transport the infections back into the country. 3604525]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[INDIA — At least 110 people have been killed after fierce dust storms struck the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan late Wednesday.

The storms have cut electricity, uprooted trees, destroyed houses and killed livestock, according to BBC. 

According to Uttar Pradesh's state disaster management authority commissioner Sanjay Kumar, the high casualty rate is due to people being trapped under falling debris caused from high-intensity winds, lightning strikes and fallen trees, according to CNN. 

The annual monsoon season in India is just starting, where afternoon storms and periods of torrential rainfall becomes prevalent. 
The powerful winds brought by the afternoon storms could be one of the factors causing so much sand and dust to be swept up into the air. 3604422]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GOTHAM CITY — DC Comics this week announced DC Universe, a streaming service for hardcore fans.

A la Netflix, the service will be subscription-based and offer users access some original programming. On offer is access to shows based on Titans, Swamp Thing, Young Justice and Harley Quinn. 

But will those B-listers be enough to get fans to shell out? We're unsure.Notably, right now, there's no Batman-centric show, which is weird, as he's a DC cash-cow.

Here's an idea: how about something along the lines of the Biggest Loser: Gotham City. We're betting Batman would make a great fat-loss coach.  

Also notably absent is Wonder Woman, which is also strange given she's their very popular at the moment. Maybe Themyscira Shore?

There also appears to be Superman Show called Metropolis … but the Big Blue Boy Scout's been done to death in film, animation and TV. So how about, this? Survivor: Planet Krypton edition. Wonder how that'll end.. 

Or if you're a fishing fan, Deadliest Catch but featuring Aquaman. 3604261]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GENEVA —  The organization says nine out of 10 people everywhere are exposed to dangerous pollutants. According to the WHO, 34% of all pollution-related deaths are due to heart disease and 20% are from stroke. The rest consist of various lung-related conditions including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.

Around 3.6 million deaths were connected to exposure from indoor air pollutants such as fumes from cooking fires and stoves. The most vulnerable are children under 5 where pneumonia is the biggest risk to life, women working in smoky kitchens and people who work outside.

According to the WHO, outdoor air pollution in cities and rural settings is caused by industry and energy supply, transportation, waste management, dust, farming practices, and household energy. 3604130]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LIMPOPO, SOUTH AFRICA —  Shamba, a South African safari lion was put down this week after a close encounter with his park's owner.

Viral video from the weekend shows Shamba, like Harambe before him, going into beast-mode on a human. Terrified tourists can be heard screaming and crying in the background. 

Footage shows center owner Mike Lodge, aged 72, inside an enclosure-type area being chased by Shamba. The Mirror reports Shamba was raised by Lodge for 10 years.

But for some reason, Shamba turned on the British expat and attacked, trying to drag him away from the Lion Mobile. That vehicle is one the Marakele center's star attractions. It lets tourists get up close and personal with the animals.

The video shows Shamba dragging Lodge away from the Lion Mobile before stopping. 
And it all happened so fast, but the attack left Lodge with in critical condition, according to the Mirror, but he did survive. Shamba, sadly did not. He was put down by via rifle. 3604125]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SEOUL — A janitor may get to keep around $325,000 worth in gold bars he found dumped in the garbage at Incheon International Airport. 

According to police, the original owner of the seven, one kilogram bars had them wrapped in newspaper and dumped them in the garbage to avoid being caught with them. 

The owner has not yet come forth to claim to gold. If the owner doesn't show up to get the gold over the next six months, the janitor will get to keep according to a finders keepers law. 

If the owner does show up, the janitor could still get five to 20 percent of the market price for the gold. 
But if the gold turns out to be stolen, the janitor gets zilch. 3604933]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA — Florida authorities are investigating the death of a man whose body was found at home Saturday by firefighters after a vape pen apparently exploded in his face.

Tampa media WTFS TV reported that the police department got a call at 9:42 a.m. about a house fire. When they arrived, they found heavy smoke inside the house and the body of 38-year-old Tallamadge D'Elia.[c] 

D'Elia was found with severe facial injuries, believed to be a result of his vape pen exploding near his face. The fire department also suspected the explosion caused the fire. 

The fire department said explosions can happen if the e-cig's lithium battery overheats and combusts, causing pieces of debris and shrapnel to fly.

A FEMA[d] report from 2000 to 2016 shows there were nearly 200 vape pen explosions, of which 29 percent of the victims suffered severe injuries. This incident could be the first vape pen death.

Authorities expect to determine an official cause of death by early this week. 3606500]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ODISHA, INDIA — A man in eastern India decided to take a selfie with a bear one day, however, that decision has cost him his life. 

According to India's Indian Express, Prabhu Bhatara had stopped to go the bathroom on the way home from a wedding when he saw the bear and just had the sudden urge to take a selfie with it.

While attempting to take the selfie, Bhatara accidentally slipped, startling the bear, which started mauling him. Villagers at the site reportedly threw rocks at the bear hoping to rescue Bhatara but that really didn't help much. 

Poor Bhatara struggled for two hours, but unfortunately didn't survive the ordeal.

Forest officials eventually made it by his side and tranquilised the bear, later recovering Bhatara's body. 3606485]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MELBOURNE, FLORIDA — A Florida woman had the unlucky experience of getting a big old cockroach stuck in her ear. 

Katie Holley and her husband had just moved into their newly purchased house, which unfortunately already had some squatters, so the couple paid for an exterminator to spray the residence, according to Self magazine.  

Problem solved. Or was it? A few weeks later on the night of April 14, Holley woke up in the middle of the night with a strange feeling in her left ear.

She went into the bathroom and used a Q-tip to see what was up, and two little black legs came out. 

After freaking out, Holley made her way to the emergency room where a doctor used some lidocaine to numb her ear and kill the roach. He then started pulling pieces of dead roach out. 

Too bad, he didn't get all of it. Nine days later, Holley's ear still felt funky, so she went to see an ENT doctor, who ended up pulling out the entire head and upper torso of the dead roach.  

Yummy. Holley said she now sleeps with cotton balls in her ears. 3606367]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY— While most banks shy away from cryptocurrency, one of the world's most well-known financial institutions is all set to bring it to Wall Street.

The New York Times reports that Goldman Sachs will soon begin using its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of its clients.

Futures contracts are legal agreements to buy and sell a certain number of assets at a predetermined price, at a specified time in the future.

The firm's executives are still somewhat skeptical of Bitcoin, concluding that while it isn't a fraud, it doesn't have the characteristics of a currency. Still, clients were interested, so the company hired its first digital assets trader to handle the crypto-trading operations.

Goldman could buy and sell actual Bitcoin in the future, but will need to secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve to do so. They will also need to find a way to securely guard the bitcoin, to avoid it being stolen by hackers, as has been the fate of many digital currency exchanges.

Experts have noted that the move will likely lend legitimacy to virtual currency, and are wondering whether it will prompt other financial institutions to follow suits. 3606260]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CENTRAL JAVA, INDONESIA —  A cop can be seen smacking a woman so hard she seemingly falls unconscious in viral footage coming out of Indonesia. 

According to Coconuts Jakarta, the Central Java Police officer, identified as only as Riyanto, didn't like what the lady was wearing, so he became mad and got physical. To make things worse, she's his niece.

According to Coconuts Jakarta, the cops were told about Riyanto's behavior, but said his victim, yes the woman he slapped unconscious, embarrasses her mother and that uncle Riyanto was asked to keep an eye out on the victim, who consistently shames the family. She often dressed inappropriately vulgar.

They also went on to try to justify the action by saying the woman has mental issues as her husband left her some time ago and that she frequently drinks and dances in the street. But they did concede that police officers shouldn't do things like beat people for what they're wearing. Jeez, aren't Central Java Police nice?

Officer Riyanto did apologize, and Coconuts Jakarta reports he won't be charged but sanctioned internally by the police. 3606149]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[OMAHA, NEBRASKA — A Nebraska woman's complaints about a runny nose reportedly turned into a health nightmare.

Reported by news station KETV, Kendra Jackson said she was given various explanations for her runny nose and headache — from allergies to winter congestion.

Jackson said her allergic reactions started after a 2013 car accident during which she hit her head on the dashboard. 

Jackson said the allergy was like a waterfall, continuously, and then it would run down the back of her throat. 

Earlier this year, doctors at Nebraska Health diagnosed Jackson with a cerebrospinal fluid leak, which was causing about half a pint of brain fluid to leak out of Jackson's brain every day.

The leaks can cause headaches, vision changes, or hearing loss. Patients are also more likely to develop meningitis, a potentially fatal infection in the lining of the brain.

Finally, Jackson underwent brain surgery a few weeks ago where doctors used her own fatty tissue to plug the brain fluid leak. 

Jackson told KETV that the surgery made a world of difference for her, she said she does not have to carry around tissues anymore and she can finally sleep better. 

Fox News reported that when Jackson returned to Nebraska Medicine for a follow-up appointment, doctors said she's expected to make a full recovery. 3607081]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PHOENIX — There was a real showstopper at Ken Jeong's latest comedy show in Arizona, and no, it wasn't the man himself.

TMZ reports that the 48-year-old comic was doing a set at the Stand-Up Live Comedy Club in Phoenix when a woman in the third row began having a seizure.

At first, Jeong thought she was heckling him, but immediately jumped off the stage when he realized it was for real. Channeling his pre-Holywood profession, Dr. Ken cleared the area and attended to the patient with the help of an EMT in the audience.

Jeong may be a full-time funnyman now, but he used to practice internal medicine back in the 90s, and is still licensed in California.

The woman eventually regained consciousness, and Jeong kept her company until the paramedics came.

He went back to do the show soon after, and was welcomed back with applause by a thoroughly impressed audience. 3607021]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PUNA, HAWAII — Hawaii's Big Island continues to be plagued by volcanic eruptions, which have destroyed several homes and forced roughly 2,000 people to evacuate.

Reuters reports that lava flows and fissures have caused a large part of the damage, though it's important to make a distinction between the two in order to better understand the situation.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, lava flows are streams of hot molten rock that pour out onto the earth during an effusive eruption.

Lava flows come in different sizes and speeds depending on the viscosity of the lava. Its path is possible to predict since flows are confined by topography.

Volcanic fissures meanwhile, are linear vents usually a few meters wide and several kilometers long through which lava spews out.

Scientists may know the general direction of magma flow underground, but it's impossible to predict when and where fissures will appear.

Seismic activity and cracks on the ground may indicate that a fissure will soon appear, but the unpredictability of this force of nature definitely makes the situation in Hawaii even more dangerous. 3606830]]></video:description>

According to Fox10, Trenton McKinley was riding a dune buggy-pulled utility trailer with a friend's niece when it flipped over. He was able to save the little girl, just before the trailer landed on his head.

The 13-year-old sustained seven skull fractures and underwent emergency surgery. Doctors believed even if he made it, he would remain a vegetable his entire life.

McKinley lay brain-dead in the hospital for several days before his parents signed papers to donate his organs to five kids who needed them.

But just a day before doctors were set to pull the plug, he began moving and soon woke up. He remembers walking through an open field, and believes it was heaven.

In just a week, the miracle teen was had already started walking, talking, and even shooting hoops.

And though his road to recovery is long and paved with many surgeries, McKinley is now back home with his family and optimistic about the future. 3606795]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[QUEEN ELIZABETH NATIONAL PARK, UGANDA — A toddler was nabbed then eaten by a leopard in one of Uganda's top national parks last week.

According to the Kampala Post, the incident took place in a  Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National park last Friday. Ugandan news site Eagle online reports the child was the son of park ranger Doreen Ayera and Senior Police Superintendent Francis Manana.

He was sitting outside a Uganda Wildlife Authority staff building at the park's Mweya Safari Lodge prior to the attack. Reportedly, the child was with his nanny at the time. 

Speaking to Eagle Online, the child's father said he snuck off to a nearby river bank and it's there the leopard got him. His nanny didn't realize he had snuck off until she heard a cry, and saw the animal disappearing into the bush. 

Authorities searched for the child the next day and recovered the remains. Eagle online reports he was buried at his ancestral home.

The leopard was taken out. According to the Eagle Online, authorities tracked the beast down and took it out because of the threat it posed to humans. 3607817]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[JOHANNESBURG — A South African movie director perished last week while filming a giraffe. 

Eyewitnesses told The Sun, Carlos Carvalho was at the camera when the animal approached. Carvalho was shooting wildlife footage with his crew in the South African game farm Glen Afric for a film titled Premium Nanny 2. 

From nowhere, the giraffe swung its neck and smacked Carvalho, throwing him 5 meters in the air. According to the The Telegraph, Carvalho received injuries to his head that one person described as severe head trauma. Giraffe necks are powerful and are often used as weapons in the wild.

The animal had previously chased another crew member, according to NewsWeek, but the crew didn't feel threatened by him. The animal won't be put down.

Carvalho was flown to a Johannesburg hospital for treatment but passed away from his wounds last Wednesday. He's survived by his wife and family. 3607771]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Israel served Japan's prime minister a dessert in a shoe 3607589]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[JERUSALEM, ISRAEL — Hosted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, a dessert was served in what appeared to be shiny men's shoes for everyone at a diplomatic dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife.

Although it looks quite bizarre for any guest, to the Japanese leader and his wife Akie, to put shoes on the table was considered by many to be particularly offensive. 

An unnamed senior diplomat who formerly served in Japan told Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth [f]that the presentation was a stupid and insensitive decision.

The diplomat added that there's nothing more despised in Japanese culture than shoes. It is equivalent to serving a Jewish guest chocolates in a dish shaped like a pig. 

The dessert was prepared by Israel's celebrity chef Segev[g] Moshe[h]. The chef's publicist said the shoe is actually a sculpture made by international artist Tom Dixon.

A Japanese diplomat told Yedioth Ahronoth that they are offended by their prime minister, even if it was meant to be a humorous gesture, they certainly do not find it funny.

Moshe received a ton of criticism after he shared pictures of his dessert creation on his Instagram account, as one person wrote That is just nasty! No chance I would eat that. The idea of eating out of someone's shoe turns the stomach.

Israel is the first stop of the Japanese leader's Middle East tour. 3607589]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Why the Kilauea eruption in Hawaii is not explosive 3607374]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[HAWAII — At least 26 homes have been destroyed by Hawaii’s Kilauea eruption, which began last week and is still ongoing.

But according to Earther, next to violent volcanic eruptions in places like Iceland, the U.S. or the Philippines, Kilauea’s is actually rather gentle.

One of the main reasons for this, according to Oregon State University, is magma composition.

The Hawaiian islands sit atop a hotspot on the Pacific Plate, which has magma that’s low in silica, and therefore less viscous.

Volcanic gases like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and water vapor can more easily escape in this type of magma. There’s little pressure buildup, resulting in an effusive eruption.

Other volcanoes, such as those on the Pacific Ring of Fire, typically occur where the oceanic plates meet the silica-rich continental plates.

The high silica content results in highly viscous magma, which traps gas bubbles and causes the buildup of pressure that then results in explosive eruptions.

According to a Denison University volcanologist, it’s possible groundwater can mix with the iron-rich lava in Hawaii to create more boom.

That hasn’t happened...yet, and for the islanders’ sake, here’s hoping it never does. 3607374]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BRUSSELS —  Businesses operating in the European Union could be fined 20 million euros or 4% of their global turnover for violating new privacy laws. 

The fine amount is determined by whichever figure is larger. According to the New York TImes, 4% of Facebook's global turnover would be around $1.6 billion.

According to Reuters, the law will apply to social media companies, banks, insurance firms, technology businesses and any enterprise which collects consumer data en-masse.

The new law means thats companies need to be more transparent about how they handle user data, get permission for it and gives users power to request for it to be deleted, or moved elsewhere.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warned the law may give rise to more cyber threats. According to Reuters, she said users opting not to give information may hamper internet security research which relies on trends in this data. 3607369]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — The U.K. government announced it will ban wet wipes as part of its 25-year environmental plan to battle plastics pollution.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs now classes wet wipes as a serious environmental hazard, along with plastic bags, according to the Sun. 

Wet wipes are made from polyester and are non-biodegradable. Makers of wet wipes say their products can be flushed, but they do not disintegrate in the sewers like toilet paper, which lead to sewer blockages.

A study from Water UK found that wet wipes are responsible for 93 percent of the material causing sewer blockages in the country, according to the Guardian.  
 
An official from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said, we have pledged to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste, and that includes single-use products that include plastic such as wet wipes. 3607360]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA — To make Uber's flying taxi service UberAIR a reality, it will need the landing pads what Uber is calling Skyports.

At the ride-hailing company's second annual Elevate Summit in Los Angeles, Uber's partnering architecture and design firms showed their winning designs of what these Skyports could look like.

The first design is called the Mega Skyport, designed by design and architecture firm Corgan. The idea is to make the platform can easily adapt its parts anywhere. The system has a skyport that could be added to open spaces like parking garages or the roof of skyscrapers.

It is said that each skyport could carry 1,000 landings per hour. Corgan imagines the system could also be used for events like concerts, art festivals, and gardens. 

Pickard Chilton and Arup took the idea of elevate with their design. It is said the design design would be able to handle 180 landings and takeoffs per hour, per module.

Boka Powell's approach is said to be able to accommodate 1,000 VTOLs and landing and take-off in three minutes, the facility is said to be able to adjust for wind change.

Gannett Fleming's design could support up to 52 eVTOLs per hour, per module, and it hopes to facilitate more than 600 vehicles and 4,000 people per hour by 2028.

The beehive design from Humphreys & Partners would be able to handle 900 passengers per level and hour.

The Beck Group's design concept would be able to accommodate 150 take-offs and landings per hour and can be scaled to up to 1,000 trips per hour. 3608684]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Hawaii bans chemical-based sunscreens to protect corals 3608679]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[HAWAII — Earlier this week, Hawaii passed a bill to ban sunscreen containing the common chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate, Gizmodo reported.

The bill follows research suggesting sunscreen with such chemicals that don't stick to human skin can hurt coral.

Oxybenzone and octinoxate can cause genetic damage to coral and other organisms living under the ocean. 

However, mineral sunscreen that uses zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are still allowed as they block the UV rays while remaining environmentally friendly.

Look for labels that say  naturally-sourced and fragrance free and check the ingredients.

In a response to the bill, Hawaii senator Mike Gabbard said he believes Hawaii is doing the right thing by banning chemical-based sunscreen, he also added the bill will make a huge difference in protecting coral reefs, marine life, and human health. 3608679]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[American Airlines shames mom trying to carry-on breast pump 3608641]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES — A breastfeeding mom says she was humiliated by American Airlines employees after attempting to bring her breast pump onboard.

Fox News reports that Kelsey Myers was boarding a Chicago-bound flight at LAX when a gate agent stopped her and said she had to check in one of her bags.

Myers claims she had a carry-on, a personal item, a small cooler of breast milk, and her breast pump. The airline allows each passenger to carry-on one personal item and a bag. But according to their own policy, breast milk cooler bags and pumps don't count toward that limit.

When Myers tried to explain this, the agent called a female supervisor, who reiterated that she needed to check her bag.

The new mom said she had extra pump supplies in her carry-on, and needed it with her, but was then chastised in front of 50 other passengers when the supervisor mockingly asked, How many boobs do you have?

Myers eventually checked a bag to end the humiliating confrontation, but has since sent in a complaint to the airline about how she was treated.

American Airlines contacted the her to offer an apology and a $75 voucher.

But Myers says it's not about the money, and she wants a proper apology. 3608641]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GOLAN HEIGHTS — The Israeli military said on Thursday it identified 20 rockets fired by Iranian forces against their positions on the Golan Heights. 

The Washington Post reports Syrian state media claims that Israel attacked the Syrian town of Quneitra, close to Golan Heights. Israel occupied that area from Syria following a conflict in 1967

The Israeli Defence Force said on Twitter that no injuries were reported on their side and that the rockets were intercepted by the country's Iron Dome defence system. 
Writing on Twitter, the IDF said it views the incident with quote great severity and remains prepared for a wide variety of scenarios.

According to the Times of Israel, a Syrian politician claimed the attack was carried out by Syria, not Iran. If it was Iranian forces, then the Thursday morning encounter would be the first ever direct fire from Iran against Israel.

The Times of Israel reports that both countries usually battle through proxies. The attack follows U.S. President Donald Trump's move to take the States out of the Iran nuclear deal and bring back sanctions against the country. 3608564]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES — The armor from the first Iron Man movie has been stolen from an L.A. warehouse.

It's a plot straight from Spiderman: Homecoming, and maybe just the kind of distraction we need from all the Infinity War feels.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the $325,000 suit was being kept in a prop storage facility in Pacoima, and likely got taken between February, when it was last seen, and April, when employees noticed it was gone.

The LAPD currently has no suspects. 3608525]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA — California has become the first U.S. state to require all new homes to be equipped with solar panels.

According to Reuters, the five-member California Energy Commission voted unanimously in favor of the proposed rule on Wednesday. 

According to Business Insider, starting January 1, 2020 any new residence three stories or less, including single-family dwellings, apartment buildings or condos, will be required to have solar panels installed. 

Houses covered in shade and homes with tiny roofs will not need panels. 
The energy commission says the new mandate will cost the average single-family homeowner about 10 grand upfront, while builders say it run more around $14,000 to $16,000.  

Energy Commission spokeswoman Amber Pasricha Beck told Reuters, homeowners will save around $19,000 in energy and maintenance costs over 30 years. 3608476]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TACOMA, WASHINGTON — Police arrested a a hospital nurse last week who may have infected at least two patients at the Puyallup[b], Washington hospital with hepatitis C. 

According to the News Tribune, Cora Weberg, 31, stole injectable drugs from Multicare Good Samaritan Hospital, where she previously worked and intentionally infected at least two patients with hepatitis C.

Police said Weberg, who has hepatitis C, purposely contaminated injectable drugs or another substance with her own blood. 

The hospital said hepatitis C is typically transmitted through the sharing of needles. 

The hospital added that two patients who were treated by Weberg were possibly infected last week, and advised the 2,600 patients who were treated in the hospital's ER during an between August 2017 and March 23 to get tested for the infection.

However, hospital workers have previously said Weberg was surprised to find out she had the virus after taking a test in March.

Weberg was then arrested at the Canadian border as she was on a planned vacation to Guam with her boyfriend.

In a response to the arrest, Weberg's attorney argued that there's no connection between the outbreak and the nurse. 

The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department has found a connection between the two infected patients and the hospital, however, the department were unable to find a link between Weberg and the patients.

According to the News Tribune, Weberg reportedly said her exposure to hepatitis C was not strong enough for her to be able to infect other people, she also denied that infecting patients, also she did not use needles on patients that she had used on herself. 3608251]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[RIALTO, CALIFORNIA — Three black filmmakers are planning to sue a Southern California police department for what they claim was a racially motivated encounter.

The Washington Post reports that Bob Marley's granddaughter Donisha Prendergast and her friends were in town for a reggae festival, and stayed two nights at an airbnb in Rialto.

While checking out and while loading luggage into the car on April 30, a white neighbor spotted them and claimed to have waved to them. When they didn't wave back, she mistook them for burglars and called the cops.

As they were leaving the property seconds later, several police cars and a helicopter arrived and quickly surrounded the group. Kelly Fyffee Marshall, one of the filmmakers, said in an Instagram post that officers ordered them to step out with their hands in the air and later asked them to show ID.

In a statement, police claim they recognized quickly that it wasn't a burglary situation, and dealt with the matter peacefully in just 22 minutes.

That's not quite how the accused people remember it.

Despite showing their booking and calling the landlord, they say a sergeant who didn't know what Airbnb was, and accused them of lying. He then investigated the incident as a possible felony for the next 45 minutes.

The trio documented the whole thing, believing they were racially profiled. According to the San Bernardino County Sun, both the cops and Airbnb owner deny this, with the latter saying the neighbor's call was based on the group's rudeness and lack of good nature, not with their being black.

Guess we should add 'waving at white people' to the list of things black folks should do to not get in trouble. 3608244]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Third-hand smoke can be found in indoor, non-smoking areas 3609364]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[PHILADELPHIA — A new study has found that chemicals from tobacco smoke can contaminate indoor areas where no one has smoked for decades.

The Washington Post reports that Drexel University researchers analyzing air in a non-smoking classroom found that chemicals from third-hand smoke made up 29% of the air mass.

When they filled a glass container with cigarette smoke and then treated it with outdoor air, the team found that third-hand smoke chemicals in the air increased by 13% after contact with the container.

Experiments show that third-hand smoke residue on surfaces can be redistributed into the air when exposed to chemicals like ammonia, and attach to aerosol particles that enter via the HVAC system.

The same system allows the particles to be carried to different rooms throughout a building, exposing people to the potentially hazardous chemicals.

Current studies on third-hand smoke indicate it has harmful effects, with one UK study suggesting every 1 in 1,000 of those exposed face an increased risk of cancer.

But scientists believe more research is needed not only on the health implications, but also on whether chemicals in increasingly popular e-cigarettes will have a similar effect. 3609364]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BERMUDA — Marine scientists have discovered over 100 new species in waters surrounding Bermuda.
 
The Nekton project team used special equipment including submersibles, as well as technical divers and remotely operated vehicles. 

The depth region they looked at is known as the raritrophic zone. Only low amounts of sunlight reach this deep. Some media have dubbed it Bermuda's twilight zone.

Last year researchers sighted a lionfish at a depth of 302m. That's said to be the deepest observed. In another study scientists also detailed a new kind of black coral fauna called Stichopathes poutalesi. This tree-like coral was sighted at 300m deep.

Oxford University Biology Professor and Director of the Nekton project Alex Rogers said the discoveries are, evidence of how little we know and how important it is to document this unknown frontier to ensure that its future is protected. 3609336]]></video:description>

According to Billboard, Spotify users won't be finding anymore of the self-streaming artist on any of the service's editorial or algorithmic playlists. 

Under the terms of a new public hate content and hateful conduct policy Spotify has implemented, the music service won't be promoting R's music in anyway. 

R. Kelly's music will still be available on Spotify however.
Several women have accused Kelly of sexual violence, coercion and running a cult. Two more women came forward to Buzzfeed this week. 3609278]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA — A new study says large predators are moving into unexpected areas in order to recolonize former hunting grounds taken over by humans. 
According to Duke University researchers in a press release, large predator sightings such as alligators on the beach, killer whales in rivers and mountain lions in open fields are a sign that local populations have rebounded thanks to conservation efforts. 

The study, published in the journal Current Biology, found that alligators and sea otters were actually re-colonizing ecosystems that had been prime hunting grounds before humans decimated their populations. 

By collating data from other studies and government reports, Duke researchers found alligators, see otters, river otters, gray whales, gray wolves, mountain lions, orangutans and bald eagles populations were either as abundant or more abundant in novel habitats than in traditional ones. 

Rebounding numbers have shown that several large predators once thought to be highly habitat specific, are actually quite adaptable. 3609226]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM — After eating tide pods and snorting condoms up their noses, teens have found a new way to hurt themselves with the ridiculous new 'deodorant challenge.'

Somerset Live reports that 15-year-old Ellie from Bristol hadn't heard of it until her friends got her to take the challenge, which involved spraying deodorant on bare skin for as long as possible.

The aerosol caused severe burns on the girl's arm, which then blistered up a day later.

Three weeks on, the wound is far from healed. According to Ellie, it's painful and still leaking yellow fluid. Her mom, Jamie, believes she might even require a skin graft.

Some kids have asked about Ellie's arm, only to then reveal similar scars that they got from doing the challenge. 

Jamie has since posted photos of her daughter's horrific burns on Facebook, in an effort to prevent others from suffering the same painful fate. 3608982]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MIAMI, FLORIDA — A caged tiger that was part of a South Florida high school's jungle-themed prom is drawing criticism from the public.

To make prom a memorable night for their students, Christopher Columbia High School held it Friday night at the DoubleTree Hotel at Miami International Airport with the exotic theme Welcome to the Jungle.

things took a dramatic turn when an actual caged tiger was wheeled in the ballroom.

In a Facebook post, the sister of one of the student said the spectacle was animal cruelty and abusive, she also believes it is the faculty's fault for arranging this sort of entertainment.

She posted three questions in her post: 1. DID THIS TIGER ASK TO ATTEND PROM? 2. Why didn't anyone open the cage and see what would happen to these 'brave and courageous fire performers?' 3. WHY DOES CCHS ALLOW SUCH ANIMAL CRUELTY?

According to the school, the prom also featured several themed decorations and animals including a lemur, two macaws, an African Fennec Fox and a tiger.

The school defended its decision by explaining the wildlife was overseen the entire time by a Florida-licensed facility, and they also released a statement to ABC defending their arrangement. 

PETA, meanwhile, released a statement saying, Wild animals aren't prom decorations. Displaying a tiger in a tiny cage and allowing students to handle lemurs is cruel to the animals and dangerous for the students, and it sends the harmful message that living beings are props to be used for human amusement. 3611259]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WAUWATOSA, WISCONSIN — The arrest of a 17-year-old in Wisconsin has sparked public outcry for how the responding officer handled the arrest.

According to WDJT-TV, Wauwatosa police responded to a call from Mayfair Mall regarding five men acting disorderly and causing a disturbance around 4:30 p.m.

Police reportedly spoke with the men in the parking lot about the reported incident. 

And here's the part that was caught on video, one cop while trying to arrest a kid, then he suddenly punched him right in his face and later pinned him down to arrest him.

The police said the video only shows a small segment of the entire event, supposedly there's another video showing the officer who you just saw punching the kid, trying talk to him but the kid allegedly refused then began to fighting with the officer, which led to the arrest.

The next day, members of the Black Panthers of Milwaukee went to the police department to ask for the officer to be fired. The group is also calling for the mall cop to be fired and a boycott of the shopping center.

In a response to the incident, the group said the kid did not deserve to be pinned down and punched in the face, regardless of whether he was causing a disturbance.

Police said the 17-year-old was arrested for disorderly conduct, battery, and resisting an officer, he has since been released from custody. 3611119]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY — Blockchain Week in the Big Apple is in full swing as financial bigwigs, tech whizzes, and experts come together to talk shop.

No doubt the biggest among the dozens of events is Consensus in Midtown, a three-day bonanza hosted by CoinDesk, reports Bloomberg.

The event features an impressive roster of speakers, which include Top Twitterhead Jack Dorsey, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, and FedEx CEO Frederick Smith.

Rapper Snoop Dogg will also be making an appearance — headlining the Ripple after party at a secret location in the Meatpacking District.

Snoop may be THE celeb at Blockchain Week, but he's not the only famous entertainer who's into them coins.

A number of celebs have started endorsing crypto startups. There's Paris Hilton for Lydian Coin, Jamie Foxx for Cobinhood, and even Steven Seagal for Bitcoiin2Gen, before authorities cracked down on it.

Over 4,000 people are expected to show up for Consensus, a big step up from last year's 2,700 attendees.

But with each ticket currently priced between $1,499 and $2,999, it's going take a heckuva lot of commitment to get in. 3611106]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PARIS — The Paris knifeman, who killed one person and wounded four others in an attack on Saturday evening, had previously been flagged as a potential security risk by authorities. 
Police have identified the attacker as 20-year-old Khamzat Azimov. Azimov shouted Allahu akbar in the busy Opera district around 9 p.m. Saturday night as he began his attack. 
According to the BBC, eyewitnesses said Azimov was dressed in a black tracksuit and had a beard. 
Azimov attempted to enter several restaurants and bars, but was blocked by people inside. 
Authorities arrived on the scene in minutes. Police first attempted to stop Azimov with a stun-gun, but when that failed, they shot him dead.  
The man killed was a 29-year-old from Luxembourg, while the four wounded included two men in their 30s, one 26-year-old woman and one 54-year-old woman. 3610941]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CAMPBELL ISLAND, NEW ZEALAND — New Zealand scientists claim a monster wave detected during a storm is the largest ever recorded in the southern hemisphere.

The BBC reports that according to the Meteorological Service of New Zealand, a solitary buoy measured a 78-foot wave in the Southern Ocean off Campbell Island on the night of May 9.

The massive wave is roughly the same height as an seven-storey building, and just a bit taller than five double decker buses stacked on top of each other.

It beat out the previous record holder — a 72-foot swell recorded in Tasmania in 2012.

The wave formed during a storm, in which the significant wave height or the average of the top third of waves measured from crest to trough reached over 48 feet.

Though a record for the Southern Ocean, larger wave heights have been identified in the northern hemisphere.

Scientists say it's possible the storm generated even bigger waves that weren't recorded by the buoy, which operates for only 20 minutes every three hours. 3610914]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[THE HEART OF THE SUN — New research published in Nature Astronomy suggests the sun will become a planetary nebula. 

These are formed by a collapsed star's core lighting up surrounding gas and dust it ejected during the final stages of stellar death. This can last for around 10,000 years, reports the Smithsonian.

Previous research posited that the sun's dying core wouldn't warm up quick enough to do this, but the new study demonstrates it could actually heat at triple this speed, reports the Smithsonian. 

That means it has the potential to form a faint planetary nebula. A researcher on the study to the Guardian that the nebula would be viewable from the Andromeda galaxy 2 million light years away. 3610847]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS — A San Antonio family with good intention learned a painful lesson after they brought two cute kittens into their home — the kittens are actually two young bobcats.

According to KENS-TV, the family's relative found the kittens close to their home near Salado Creek in northeastern San Antonio. 

Due to their jungle cat appearance, the family just assumed the kittens are Bengal cats and took them in.

The aww moment stopped when the kittens started biting people and ripping the milk bottles apart. After Googling the kittens' size, robust nature, and their bobbed tails, the family realized the kittens might not be regular house cats.

The family called for help and the bobcat kittens were taken to the care of  Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation.

San Antonio's Animal Care Services told KENS-TV that it's possible the felines came from the Salado Creek area, where parts are still underdeveloped and wildlife roam free. 

According to animal experts, bobcat kittens have black tips on their distinct, triangle-shaped ears, with white patches just underneath the back, and short, black-tipped tails. 3610795]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — First lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the White House said on Monday.
The White House said the surgery was successful with no complications, and that the first lady would most likely remain in the hospital for the duration of the week, according to CNN. 
During an embolization procedure, blood supply is cut to a certain part of the body, in order to stop oxygen flow to the affected area.

One instance where a benign kidney growth would require an embolization procedure is with an angiomyolipoma, a benign collection of fat and muscle .  
According to CBS News, embolizations can also be used to treat aneurysms, or artery bulges, and arteriovenous malformation, or abnormal artery and vein connections. 3611852]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA — An 81-year-old man who made it his life's work to give blood has just made his last donation, ending a 60-year run that helped save millions of little lives.

According to the Australian Red Cross, James Harrison was inspired to donate blood after receiving a lifesaving blood transfusion at age 14. Since age 18, he's given 1,162 donations from his right hand, and ten from his left, earning him the nickname, the man with the golden arm.

Harrison's blood is special. His plasma contains a unique antibody that protects unborn babies from the deadly Rhesus D Haemolytic Disease, or HDN.

The condition occurs when a pregnant woman with Rh negative blood carries a baby with Rh positive blood. Her body reacts to the incompatibility by producing antibodies to neutralize the baby's red blood cells, resulting in devastating effects, reports the Sydney Morning Herald.

HDN can lead to miscarriages, and has been known to cause heart failure, brain damage, or even death in newborns.

Thankfully, Australian scientists made a breakthrough with Anti-D, a lifesaving medication that uses Harrison's unique to plasma to stop the disease.

As the program's pioneer donor, every ampule of Anti-D produced in Australia contains his blood, which means he's saved over 2.4 million babies.

If he hadn't reached the age limit for donations, the remarkable grandpa says he'd still be carrying on with his work.

He does hope someone else takes up the mantle and surpasses his record very soon. 3611835]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ISLAND OF HAWAII, HAWAII — Geologists have warned an explosive eruption is possible at Hawaii's Kilauea volcano.

Writing last Wednesday, the United States Geological Survey said if lava at the Kilauea volcano summit drops beneath groundwater levels, the inflow of water could result in steam-driven explosions.

The USGS warns that steam-driven ballistic projectiles — blocks measuring 2 meters across and weighing up to several tons — could be sent flying 1 kilometer from the summit. Smaller blocks may travel farther.

Citing geologists, Reuters reports an explosive eruption could send ash plumes as high as 6,000 meters. Ash clouds and other, even smaller debris from such an even could spread up to 19.2 kilometers from the Kilauea summit. 3611807]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ADELANTO, CALIFORNIA — A California boy is lucky to be alive after surviving a fall onto a highway from a runaway bounce house.

THe child's family had rented the structure for a party. It's unknown if the bounce house was secured, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Sgt Marc Bracco of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department told the Times it was probably a freak accident, caused by strong winds.

NBC News reports the bounce house was blown around a quarter mile from the home and onto a highway. Law enforcement said it rolled onto the road and then the child fell out.

The 9-year-old boy was taken to hospital, but escaped with minor injuries. Sgt Bracco told the Times that the boy got lucky.

The bounce house next struck a sedan. Police say the driver was shook up, but uninjured. 3611735]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — A 20-year-old man survived falling from a fourth-story balcony over the weekend inside the famous Luxor hotel in Las Vegas.

Police say the unnamed man either jumped or fell from the balcony around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday, the Associated Press reported. 

The man reportedly fell from the pyramid shaped hotel's fourth floor balcony, but fortunately some of the hotel's decorations saved him before he smashed into the ground. 

He only suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital for treatment. 

Police told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that alcohol played a role in the incident. 

Others who had similar experience weren't so lucky though, according to Las Vegas Review-Journal. In 2012, a 21-year-old California native accidentally plunged five stories from the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Vegas. 

Another incident covered in the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported a 38-year-old man also accidentally plunged nine stories off the Hard Rock Hotel's balcony. 3611681]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CROATIA/CZECH REP/MARS — Could this this little triangle on a lighting bolt come from another world?

Passed to YouTuber Secureteam10, the image was taken by Instagram user mrslampshade. The triangle shape on the lighting bolt has UFO-enthusiasts intrigued.
The channel featured it in a video earlier this month that's since gone viral.

Some commenters on the video believe the triangle is actually an alien craft, using the lightning as a power source. The location of the video, according to secureteam10, is in the Czech Republic. But a reading of the Instagram post in the clip says it's Croatia. 

Those countries are quite far apart, perhaps said aliens were on a lighting-bolt trip around central Europe. 

Secureteam10 claims that the image is similar to other evidence they've gathered 
They reckon it maybe to do with the energy surrounding Earth. Other users pointed out it's part of the natural pattern lightning forms while striking the ground. 3611612]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HOUSTON — A Nigerian woman is suing United Airlines after she claims she and her family were unjustly kicked off a flight in 2016.

According to the documents filed in court, Queen Obioma and her kids were flying from Lagos, Nigeria to Ontario when they encountered trouble on the Houston to San Francisco leg of their trip.

Obioma, who was in business class while the kids were in economy, found a white man in her seat. He refused to move despite repeated requests, so she sat in his spot.

The man got up as soon as she sat down, allegedly beelining straight for the captain to complain about Obioma's 'pungent' smell.

When she came back from the bathroom, the man blocked her from getting to her seat. She eventually managed to squeeze past him, only to have an attendant ask her to step outside.

He told her she was being booted off because the white passenger couldn't stomach her Eau de Nigeria. She explained who she was travelling with, only to have her kids escorted off the plane too.

The family waited five more hours before the next flight, which meant missed appointments and more money down the drain.

While United is actually allowed to throw out smelly passengers, Obioma is crying racial discrimination, claiming she was singled out and punished because of her black skin.

Something definitely smells foul, we're just not sure if it's United, Obioma, the white man, or all three. What do you think? 3611423]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA['MERICA — The New York Times reports, more than two dozen people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning or suffered from debilitating injuries after accidentally leaving their vehicles running in the garage

According to car information website Edmunds, keyless car drivers at times tend to forget to shut off the motor. Newer cars or cars with quieter engines are so quiet that drivers may often think they've stopped running.

Consumer reports suggests that automakers should add an audible alarm feature that can be heard from outside when a driver gets out of a running keyless car. 

While some carmakers already have a similar feature in their products, GM have designed theirs to automatically shut off once the driver has left the car for a certain period of time. 

Ford's keyless cars now have a feature that automatically turns the engine off after 30 minutes of idling.

In an interview CNN, AAA's spokesman said the most important thing for drivers is to make sure a car is turned off every time when it's parked. He also suggested that drivers to know how to identify when their car is on or off.

To prevent this and other tragic accidents, the New York City Fire Department suggested installing carbon monoxide detectors into our home living rooms. 3612280]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[What are the symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis? 3612261]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA — An Indianapolis woman died two months after contracting necrotizing fasciitis while on vacation in Florida.

This disease is commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria. 
According to Tech Times, 50-year-old Carol Martin was misdiagnosed by doctors twice. 

It wasn't until her third visit to the hospital, after her condition had become serious, did physicians realize it was flesh-eating bacteria. 
According the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, necrotizing fasciitis is a serious bacterial infection that spreads quickly and kills the body's soft tissue. 
People with flesh-eating bacteria usually begin to display symptoms within a couple of hours after an injury. 
Symptoms may seem like another injury or illness. Some people complain of a pulled muscle like pain or soreness. 

The skin may also get warm and form red or purplish areas of inflammation that rapidly spread. 

Later symptoms can include fever, chills, fatigue and vomiting. 

If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. 3612261]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[MH370 pilot deliberately crashed plane, say aviation experts 3612241]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA — A panel of aviation experts have suggested that Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 was deliberately flown off-course and crashed.

CBS reports that the experts put together by 60 Minutes Australia believe the captain masterminded the plane's disappearance, in what is possibly an intricately planned mass murder-suicide.

According to Boeing 777 pilot and instructor Simon Hardy, the aircraft flew along the Thai-Malaysian border, criss-crossing into both countries' airspace to avoid detection.

Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah dipped the plane's wings left over his hometown of Penang, leading Hardy to suspect he looked out the window in an emotional goodbye. The plane then turned northwest before dropping off the range of military radar.

Crash investigator Larry Vance believes the captain depressurized the cabin at some point to disable passengers, which could explain the lack of any texts or emergency calls.

Satellite data had picked up faint signals from the plane's engines, showing it could have flown either north toward Kazakhstan, or south to the Indian Ocean. Calculations indicated the latter.

In searching for the missing plane, the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau worked under the assumption that it crashed into the ocean following an uncontrolled dive.

Hardy believes the pilot was controlling the aircraft until the end. He would have easily pulled out of the death dive and flown longer before impact, which would put the crash site outside the current search area.

While the experts present some compelling theories, the fact remains that four years on, the plane has yet to be found.

Without solid evidence from the wreckage, there's no way to definitively unravel the mysteries surrounding MH370. 3612241]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — Passengers on an Alaskan Airlines flight were more than a little shell shocked after a man started running through the plane in his birthday suit.

The Mercury News reports that Nick Steffl first noticed the dude while he was watching James Franco's The Disaster Artist while still fully clothed.

He said he suspects the movie might have played a role in the nudity that ensued, since one scene shows Franco in all his naked glory.

Retired Alaska senator Johnny Ellis was also on the flight. Both he and Steffl witnessed the man bolting to the cockpit whooping and hollering, before turning back toward the rear.

Steffl stood up to confront the man, asking him what he was doing and then slapping him across the face when he gave a wisecrack response.

Seconds later, a second passenger who might've been the fella's dad restrained and then took him to the crew area.

Despite being out of sight, the naked man shouted crazy things until the plane landed in Anchorage 45 minutes later.

Police waiting at the gate took him into custody and later brought him to a hospital. 3613322]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BIG ISLAND, HAWAII — When the Kilauea volcano began erupting on Hawaii's Big Island, humans were not the only ones fleeing for their lives.

As firefighters arrived to help Carol Hosely and her pets evacuate her Leilani Estates home, the two dogs decided to take off in a panic, according to Hawaii News Now.

Hosely's Jack Russell pug mix Brus was terrified of men and decided to make a run for it with his friend Little Dude, a black terrier mix.

Volunteers from Aloha Ilio Rescue, where Brus was adopted from just six months ago, aided Hosley in the search for the two missing dogs.

After 10 days, volunteers found the dogs trapped between a cooled lava flow and a fence line. They had gotten stuck behind a fence and couldn't get out because of the lava surrounding them.

The rescue group worked their way through grass and climbed through a fence to rescue the pups, who had been bitten by red ants and were badly shaken.

For now, the pups will be staying with the rescue group until Hosley finds permanent housing. 3613186]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[NJ school official calls police chief "skinhead cop" during traffic stop 3613162]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SOUTH ORANGE, NEW JERSEY — A New Jersey school official was caught on camera using foul language and calling a police chief a skinhead during a traffic stop last month. 

In dash cam video released by South Orange Police, on April 27, an police officer pulled the New Jersey school board member over to the side of the road because she was reportedly going 37 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour zone.

When the officer approached her driver-side window, Stephanie Lawson-Muhammad pointed out that she was on the New Jersey Board of Education.

As she became more hysterical, she called the officer's superior a skinhead cop chief. Lawson-Muhammad was then heard breaking into tears saying I'm scared of cops because you guys hurt black people.

The police officer in the video is white. Lawson-Muhammad is black.

Assuming Lawson-Muhammad was about to have a panic attack, the officer asked if she needed an ambulance. She replied she did not and said that's an insult.

The officer told her that she was getting summonses for speeding and for not having a valid insurance card. She argued that she didn't want to go to court and she has insurance. 

Lawson-Muhammad threatened to call the local high-ranking officials after the officer said he could not void the ticket. She was eventually let go after accepting the ticket from the officer. 

In a response to the speeding incident, Lawson-Muhammad and the school board's spokesperson did not comment on it, New Jersey's New Jersey 101.5 reported. 

The South Orange-Maplewood Black Parents Workshop has asked the board member to issue a public apology and accused her of attempting to exercise her civic privilege during the traffic stop. 

The Parents Workshop group later sent the school board president a letter informing that the board member may have abused her authority during the traffic stop and had engaged in abusive behavior toward the officer. 

The group says that had their roles been reversed, and the police officer had treated Lawson-Muhammad in the manner in which she treated him, they would be going after him the same way.

The South Orange Police Chief told New Jersey 101.5 that he had not read the letter from the Parents Workshop group, but he did acknowledge that the responsible officer handled the situation professionally. 3613162]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEYOND SPACE AND TIME — New research simulating the effects of dark energy on star formation speculates that alien life may exist in another universe.

Star formation, according to Durham Cosmology Professor Richard Bower, is the battle between the attraction of gravity and repulsion of dark energy. Our universe is believed to host very little of the substance. Scientists speculate large amounts of the theoretical substance creates dead universes.

Researchers simulated the impact of several hundred times more dark energy and found it had only a modest impact on star and planet formation. The small amount of dark energy in our own universe, according to the researchers, may be due to an undiscovered law of nature. 3613087]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WINDSOR, ENGLAND — In preparation for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's May 19 royal wedding, a massive security operation has been deployed throughout Windsor. 
More than 100,000 expected visitors will have to pass through tight security measures to get into the small town, according to Reuters.   

Around 3,000 police officers are also expected to be on hand. In addition to road closures which will seal off the town and police patrols, visitors will have to pass through airport-style scanning checks before they can reach the street surrounding the castle, Reuters reported. 

Automatic license plate recognition technology has been checking vehicles entering town, while authorities have been conducting random stops, according to NBC News. 
Large steel and concrete barriers have been erected in and around Windsor to prevent vehicle attacks.  

Police have been searching through garbage bins, searching drain and manhole covers and using sniffer dogs to search mailboxes. 
According the Thames Valley Police, counter-drone systems may also be used as part of the security operation. 3613078]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GAYLORD, MICHIGAN — A Michigan man got the shock of his life one morning when he discovered a secret stash in the hood of his car.

The Detroit Metro Times reports that on May 11, Kelan Moore was driving to his opening shift at the Iron Pig Smokehouse in Gaylord, Michigan, when he started hearing strange noises coming from his car's AC.

When he lifted the hood of his newly acquired vehicle, he was surprised to find it filled with 50 pounds worth of pine cones.

A sneaky squirrel had apparently been using the engine as storage space for winter.

It took two people 45 minutes to clear out all the pine cones, which at that point had already expanded from the engine heat.

Moore's friend Gabe Awrey later posted a photo on Facebook, with Moore commenting that he was going to suss out and strangle the furry culprit. 3613023]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA — Chimpanzees maintain cleaner beds compared to humans because they in essence change their sheets every night, according to a new study. 

Researchers from North Carolina State University published their findings in the Royal Society Open Science journal on Tuesday.  

Scientists swabbed chimpanzee nests in the Issa Valley in Tanzania and discovered only 3.5 percent of the bacteria found originated from the chimps' own skin, saliva or feces, according to National Geographic. 
According to a previous North Carolina study, human beds in comparison had bacteria levels around 35 percent. 
The team also found that chimpanzee nests had few ticks and fleas. 
One explanation for the difference in levels of bacteria, is that chimps build a new nest each night, while humans sleep typically sleep in the same room. 3613019]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SALINE, MICHIGAN — A 47-year-old Michigan woman has lost her job after local police discovered she put laxatives in brownies on purpose for co-worker's farewell party.

According to the Saline Post, police said the woman, who worked at a engineering firm, had dumped a tube of laxatives into the brownie batter.

The woman reportedly didn't like the co-worker who was leaving. 

But before she could pass out the laxative treats, someone tipped off the company, allowing her supervisors to confiscate the brownies and called cops.

While questioning the woman, she denied putting the laxatives into the mix. The cops said they were happy to get the treats analyzed, that's when she confessed and called it a bad joke.

Fortunately nobody ate the brownies, and the company had no other option than to fire the woman and press charges against her for her little prank.

In an interview with Charlotte observer, Saline Police Chief Jerrod Hart said a lot of times movies or TV shows have someone attempting to put medication into food as a joke, but it is actually very serious as it's both unnecessary and criminal. 3613011]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GLASGOW, UNITED KINGDOM — Researchers have connected irregular sleep patterns with mood disorders and depression.

Disrupting the body's circadian rhythm by going to bed late and using smartphones late at night maybe impacting people's mental health.

Research published in the Lancet suggests people more active at night than in the day are up to 10% more likely to be found to have a mood disorder.

The study found higher rates of depression, unhappiness, bipolar disorder, loneliness, mood instability and poor reaction-times in individuals with disrupted body clocks, the BBC reported.

Speaking in the Guardian, a researcher recommended not using mobile phones, or getting drinks late at night, and avoiding other activities at night. 3612992]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON/CARDIFF — Face recognition technology used by British police is inaccurate in many cases according to new findings.

New findings by British newspaper the Independent say that facial recognition technology employed by the UK's Metropolitan Police force is wrong 98% of the time.
The newspaper reports that of 104 alerts created by the force's face recognition system, 
only two were correct.

Elsewhere, the Independent also found that facial recognition used by police in Wales has been wrong 2,400 times since last June.The newspaper reports that most of this happened last summer in Cardiff when the city was hosting UEFA Champions League final. Less than 10 per cent were accurate matches. 3612986]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[OCALA, FLORIDA — A Florida teacher is trying to catch his breath after being placed on administrative leave for allegedly having his students drown two wild raccoons and an opossum in class. 

A 15-second video published by WKMG in Orlando shows a group of students filling a garbage can with a hose and then later submerging a raccoon, which was trapped inside a metal trap. 

The raccoons had reportedly been killing chickens the students were raising for class. How dare they kill chickens? Humans would never do anything like that — ughh.  

Looks like teacher Dewie Brewton had his students from his agricultural class dispose of two raccoons and an opossum on Monday at Forest High School. 
Brewton is currently on leave with pay as the school investigates the incident. Authorities from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are also investigating. 3614091]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Teen develops 'wet lung' after vaping for three weeks 3614085]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[PENNSYLVANIA — A Pennsylvania woman developed hypersensitivity pneumonitis, otherwise known as wet lung, after using e-cigarettes.

E-cigarettes work by heating liquid that turns into vapor, which the user then inhales and exhales, much like when one smokes a cigarette. The liquids usually contain flavorings, propylene glycol, glycerin and often nicotine.
 
An 18-year-old Pennsylvania woman had only been vaping for three weeks when she developed symptoms so severe that she was sent to the emergency room of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, CNN reports.

In a study published in the journal Pediatrics, Dr. Casey Sommerfeld of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, who was part of the study, says chemicals in an e-cigarette may have triggered a patient's body to create an immune response, leading to lung damage and inflammation.

Sommerfeld said the immune response in the patient led to increased inflammation and leaky blood vessels, which in turn can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs.

The teenager exhibited symptoms of coughing, difficulty breathing that was quickly getting worse, and sudden stabbing pains in her chest every time she inhaled or exhaled.

When her condition worsened and she went into respiratory failure, she required a mechanical ventilator to breathe for her, and required tubes inserted on both sides of her chest to drain fluid from her lungs.

The woman's condition was diagnosed as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sometimes called wet lung, which is an inflammation of the lungs due to an allergic reaction to chemicals or dust.

After being treated with methylprednisolone, a drug used to treat severe allergic reactions, the woman's condition improved and she was taken off the mechanical support system five days after being admitted to the hospital, CNN reported. 3614085]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BIG ISLAND, Hawaii  — Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, located in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, has been erupting nonstop since May 3. 

On Thursday, the volcano erupted once again, driving volcanic ash and debris as high as 30,000 feet into the air, USA Today reported.

The explosion took place in Halema'uma'u Crater at Kilauea's summit around 4:17 a.m. local time. 

The U.S. Geological Survey said the plume of ash and debris was drifting northeast and cautioned residents to shelter in place. They also mentioned there is a chance the volcano might turn explosive again, which would result in an increase of ash production and ballistic projectiles near the vent. 

Hawaii Emergency Management Agency also warned that the ash is likely to affect local waters for several hours. 

Kilauea volcano, one of the five active volcanoes in Hawaii, has been closed since May 11 as the lava seeping through has forced the evacuation of nearly 2000 people near Leilani Estates.

More than two dozen homes have already been destroyed in the neighborhood near Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii. 3614010]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Why some people hear 'yanny' and some hear 'laurel' 3613995]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[THE INTERNET — An audio clip saying either the word yanny or laurel has gone viral over social media.   

The short audio clip originated on Vocabulary.com under the word laurel, and was traced back to a Flowery Branch High School freshman in Georgia on May 11, who posted the audio clip to her Instagram story, according to Wired.

The sound clip was then posted by YouTuber Cloe Feldman onto Twitter where it took off.
A possible explanation why people are hearing different words is because the file is acoustically ambiguous or very poor-quality, according to Northwestern University neurobiology professor Nina Kraus. 
The clip that went viral had already been re-recorded several times, meaning there were multiple steps that degraded the quality of the audio.   

According to Brad Story, professor of speech, language and hearing sciences at the University of Arizona, the two words also have similar sound patterns. 
This combined with the low quality of the sound file could account for the different things people hear. 
The pitch of the clip can also affect what is heard. In general, people heard yanny more consistently when the pitch was lower and laurel when the pitch was higher. 3613995]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Is Pokémon coming to the Nintendo Switch? 3613976]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[TOKYO — Pokémon  fans are lit online over alleged leaks of a possible new online-driven Poke-title that might be coming to the Nintendo Switch. 

It all goes back to when game industry scoopster Emily Rogers blogged that the name of a new Pokémon game might be revealed by the end of May. According to IGN, several hours after news of that came out, a someone posted an image of the game's Japanese title to 4Chan. 

The 4Chan user claims it'll be a remake of Pokémon Yellow titled Pokémon Let's Go! with Eevee and Pikachu editions, with said elderly monsters being the starters in each. 
Interestingly Red and Blue, characters from the 1996 original are rumored to return.

Kotaku reports websites for pokemonletsgopikachu.com and pokemon letsgoeevee.com 
were both registered by the same company acting as tech contact for Pokémon -sunmoon.com

Thee 4chan leak also claims the game will feature integration and rewards with Pokémon  Go. This is interesting, because the House of N recently announced their paid for Nintendo Switch Online service. Once that goes live in Sept 2018, online Switch play will no longer be free for games such as Mario Kart. 

If news of this future Pokémon game on the Switch turns out to be true, it will be interesting to see if Nintendo use it to make bank on their online services. 3613976]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[New research published in the journal Nature details findings that posit somewhere in East Asia is producing a banned ozone depleting chemical. 

According to the BBC, CFC-11 was used in the 1930s as a refrigerant. It could also be found in solvents and aerosols. Scientists say the continued production of the chemical may slow the recovery of the Ozone.

Speaking to Time, university of Maryland expert Ross Salawitch said the rogue production of CFC-11 could hurt the ozone recovery.

Researchers considered several factors to explain the continued presence of CFC-11, but concluded that unreported new production is behind it. 3613784]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BIG ISLAND, HAWAII — Hawaii's Kilauea volcano claimed its first serious injury after a local was lava-bombed while on his home's balcony.

The Honolulu Star Advertiser reports that according to Hawaii County Fire Department officials, the homeowner had been standing on his 3rd floor balcony when a lava bomb struck his leg, shattering it from shin to foot. He's alive but currently in the hospital, reports ABC 13.

Lava bombs are masses of molten rock that are hurled hundreds of feet into the air during an eruption, and which solidify before hitting the ground.

According to officials, these lava spatters can be as large as a cow and weigh as much as a refrigerator. Even small pieces can be deadly.

Scientists believe the spatter as well as a recent change in lava flow may be due to old and new magma mixing in the ground, creating hotter and higher lava fountains.

Elsewhere on Big Island, quick-flowing lava from two fissures has reportedly merged and cut through a highway towards the ocean. This latest development has prompted evacuations and health hazard warnings due to increased sulfur dioxide emissions. 3615765]]></video:description>

According to Chinese state media, a long-range H-6K bomber was used in landing and take off drills. 

Beijing's defense ministry did not say where the bomber landed, but added the drills included simulated strikes against sea targets. 

According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, using Chinese social media posts, identified the location as Woody Island. 
The H-6K has a combat radius of almost 1,900 nautical miles (3,520 km), meaning all of Southeast Asia would be in range from Woody Island, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.   
The South China Sea is a vital global trade route subject to overlapping claims by six countries. 
Analysts say China will soon land bombers even farther south in the Spratly Islands, where runways and hangars have also been built on reefs. 3615701]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NORTH BEND, WASHINGTON —  A cougar who mauled two mountain bikers, killing one, has been eliminated. 

Authorities told Washington state outlet KOMOnews, the two were riding down a remote road on Saturday when they came into contact with the beast.

The animal gave chase to both of them. They tried to fight it off with their bicycles, but the beast got the better of them, CNN reported.

The cougar mauled one of the men to death and seriously wounded the other. He's fine now, but was in serious condition following the attack. Authorities later tracked and killed the beast. 

Fish and Wildlife told KOMOnews that this is second time someone's been killed by a mountain in the last 100 years. 3615693]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Hotels pools and hot tubs were linked to a third of all swimming-related disease outbreaks between 2000 to 2014, a new CDC report finds. 

During that stretch, a total of 493 outbreaks linked to chlorinated or treated water were reported in 46 states and Puerto Rico, the report said. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the results on Thursday in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 

In total, the outbreaks led to at least 27,219 illnesses and eight deaths, according to the report.
Cryptosporidium (also known as Crypto), Pseudomonas, and Legionella were responsible for many of the outbreaks at swimming venues during that 15-year period.
Crypto is a parasite that can survive even in properly maintained pools. Pseudomonas and Legionella are bacteria that can survive disinfectants in slimy areas of hot tubs, pools and water parks. 
The CDC report also outlined tips on how to protect from germs while at public swimming areas. 3615687]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[DUBLIN — A large segment Ireland's bumble bee species is facing extinction.

According to the Irish Times, one third of Ireland's 98 bumble bee species are facing extinction. The Irish Mirror reports that 21 species of bees are crucial to the environment as they provide pollination for crops and flowers.

An ecologist told the Irish Mirror that prior to 1960, rare species like the great yellow bumble bee, red-shanked carder bee and shrill carder bee used to be present across Ireland.

Reasons for the dwindling bee population, according to the Irish Mirror, are habitat loss, pesticides, climate change and starvation brought about by a decline in wildflowers. 3615628]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SUGAR LAND, TEXAS — A 7-foot alligator was found tucked under a family's SUV in Sugar Land, Texas overnight, and it appeared that it did not want to leave.

After seeing the unexpected visitor under their SUV, a Texas family called Fort Bend County Sheriff's deputies who had to get help to capture the alligator.

Given the fact that the gator is about 7 foot, the cops had no other choice but to called in Gator Chris and the Texas Gator Squad for help. 

After twisting, turning and turning and thrashing from the gator for a while, the surprise guest was finally pulled from under the SUV and put back into the Brazos River.

So why was the gator camping out under the family's SUV? According to KTRK-TV, the reptile was apparently on the prowl.

Gator Chris told KTRK-TV said during this time of the year, gators travel frequently at night to look for food, girlfriends, and setting up time for mating.

According to UPI, another gator looking for amore was caught on camera this week in Florida as it wandered all the way inside a home garage but eventually left on its own, guess the gator never found its love.

Authorities recommend people call for help if they see an alligator in their vicinity. And, while taking pictures seems like something we do now, do not go near it as it may be the last thing you ever do. 3615558]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ELYRIA, OHIO — Police Elyria, Ohio were skeptical when they received a call around 5:30 a.m., on Saturday, from a man who claimed he was being followed by a pig.

The authorities with the North Ridgeville Police Department immediately assumed the guy was drunk and hallucinating. However, it turned out that the man was completely sober and was telling the truth.

The man was actually walking home from Elyria's Amtrak train station during the wee hours of the morning when a pig started following him. He wasn't quite sure what to do so he called up the authorities. When the officers arrived they managed to get the pig into the police cruiser.

The pig was taken to the city's dog kennel for awhile, until it was returned to its owner around 8:23 a.m. 3615541]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[THE WORLD — New research posits that Bitcoin mining will consume half a percent of the world's total electricity by the end of 2018, then 5 percent in a few years.

According to research published in the journal Joule, the same amount of electricity used in one Bitcoin transaction could power the average Dutch household for a month.
The study says the Bitcoin network currently consumes 2.55 gigawatts of electricity, nearly the same as Ireland. By the end of 2018, the study predicts predicts that number rise to 7.8 gigawatts.

Bitcoin transactions require massive computational power, and thereby large amounts of electricity to function. Computers in the decentralized Bitcoin network calculating transactions compete every 10 minutes to create the next block of transactions in the chain. Known as Bitcoin mining, this process sees the winning hardware get 12.5 bitcoins, or around $100,000. 

However, as Bitcoin calculations become more difficult to solve people employing more computational power have a higher chance of winning. The problem with this, study author Alex Devries explained to Gizmodo, is that the process motivates participants in the network to use more hardware, and as a result more power. 3615534]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ST. GEORGE, UTAH — A dog tasered by police officers in Utah earlier this month may get euthanized. 

On May 3, 2018 two officers from St George city PD paid Willie Mosher a visit over an alleged domestic dispute with his unidentified female partner. The officer's body cams were rolling whole time. 

Footage from the equipment show both officers being attacked and chased by Mosher's dog, Champ, a large male German Shepherd. Despite being afforded several chances by police to calm the canine down, Mosher couldn't and the responding officers had to use their tasers on the animal.

Mosher was arrested in relation to the dispute with his partner, and Champ was set to be put down. But following social media uproar from Mosher's family and friends, authorities are now letting a third party judge examine him. If Champ cannot be retrained he'll be euthanized. 

Mosher's mother told the St George Spectrum newspaper Champ's been kept in an animal shelter for the past 2 weeks and that he's had no visitors. She says who ever examines Champ will do so without his family present to calm him. 

St George Mayor Jon Pike praised the officers' restraint for not shooting the dog.  Speaking to the Spectrum, Pike said he hopes Champ could be retrained, but added that the safety is also a priority. 3616488]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM — A British woman had been suffering from extremely painful periods ever since she was 15. 

Calle Hack told Business Insider that every month leading up to her period, she would have a ton of bloating and inflammation, crazy lower back pain, blackouts, hot and cold flashes and fits of dry heaving, and a coppery taste in her mouth.
Doctors told her that some people just have more painful periods than others, but when she got into her 20s, the symptoms got even worse. 
Finally, five doctors and an ultrasound later, Hack discovered she actually had a orange-sized dermoid cyst on her right ovary.  

Dermoid cysts are sac-like growths comprised of hair, teeth, skin, bone or cartilage.

According to the American Journal of Scientific Research, ovarian dermoid cysts are usually present at birth, but don't develop until the reproductive years. 

Hack finally had the cyst removed in November 2017, which her doctors said looked like a rotten chicken wing. 3616479]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HAWAII — People in Hawaii are now being warned of white plumes of toxic air and extremely fine glass particles as lava continues to pour out from the Kilauea volcano.

Officials warned the public on Sunday to avoid the cloud formed by the chemical reaction when lava meets seawater, according to CBS News. 

According to officials, two lava flows have reached the Pacific, creating thick steam clouds known as laze. 

Laze clouds are laced with hydrochloric acid and fine glass shards that can irritate skin and eyes and affect breathing. 

The laze cloud from the plume spread as far as 15 miles west of location the lava entered the Pacific on the Big Island's southern coast, according to CBS News. 

The Coast Guard is currently enforcing a 984-foot (330 meters) safety zone around the ocean point of entry. 

Kilauea has burned down 40 structures, including 25 homes since it starting erupting on May 3. Around 2,000 people have had to evacuate their homes. 3616476]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — China has deployed a relay satellite that's meant to bridge communication between Earth and a planned exploration on the far side of the moon.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Queqiao, or magpie bridge, is named after a Chinese folklore in which magpies form a bridge to enable two star-crossed lovers to meet for one day.

The Queqiao satellite features a dish antenna and two solar arrays, and was launched atop a Long March 4C rocket from southwest China on Sunday morning.

Queqiao is expected to enter a halo orbit around the second Lagrangian Point, and would be the world's first communication satellite operating in that orbit.

Its main purpose is to establish a communication link between Chinese Mission control and the Chang'e 4 lunar probe, which will explore the moon's dark side. It's currently scheduled for a December 2018 launch.

Queqiao is also equipped with the Netherlands-China Low-Frequency Explorer, a radio scanner that will search for ancient radio signals dating back to the formation of the early universe.

The reason the satellite is able to do this is because it would be in the shadow of the moon, completely unaffected by Earth's interference. 3616398]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HAVRE, MONTANA — A Montana border guard is at the center of social media outrage after he held two U.S. citizens because he heard them talking en español.

According to the Washington Post, Ana Suda and Mimi Hernandez —  both Mexican-Americans —  were at a gas station in Havre, Montana and were speaking Spanish.

That's when border patrol Agent O'Neal heard their non-English lingo, he deemed that suspicious and asked them for ID. 

The Post reported that Suda asked if he racially profiled them. O'Neal denied this, saying he's questioning them cuz they were speaking Spanish in an area where it's not commonly spoken.

The New York Post reports they were held for 40 minutes before being let go. Under U.S. law border guards' jurisdiction fall within 100 miles from the U.S. border. 3616321]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY — An unnamed 14-year-old New York City boy is facing charges after police said he pretended to be an officer and robbed a 64-year-old man who is legally blind.

According to the NYPD, the kid lied to the old man that he was a police officer and offered to lead him through a subway station at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue near Macy's.

After the young fake cop helped the blind man past a turnstile to his subway train, the kid then started going through the man's bag and took his wallet, which contained $85  in cash and several credit cards.

Security footage provided by the NYPD showing the teen unzipping the blind man's backpack and taking out his wallet.

The boy left the subway station with the wallet. Police later discovered one of the cards was used for a $500 charge at a nearby store. And justice was served when the young thug's mother turned him in to the police.

The NYPD said the boy actually looked younger than 14 years old.

ABC News reports the kid now faces charges of grand larceny and criminal impersonation of a police officer. 3616186]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA — A company that collects real-time location data of millions of cell phone users throughout North America had a bug on its website that let anyone see where a person was located without having to obtain consent. 

LocationSmart is a data aggregator and says it has direct connections to cell carriers to obtain location information from nearby cell towers, according to ZDNet.
The website has a trial-page that allows interested customers to test the accuracy of the system. 

The page requires explicit consent from the user before location data can be collected by sending a one-time text message.  

However, a bug on the website discovered by Carnegie Mellon University researcher Robert Xiao, allowed anyone to track someone's location without their consent. 
Xiao told ZDNet, a simple bug allowed a person to skip the consent section and jump straight to the location. 

In a statement from spokesperson Brenda Schafer, LocationSmart confirmed that the vulnerability was not exploited prior to May 16, and did not result in any customer information being obtained without their permission.
Xiao said the bug may have exposed almost every cell phone user in North America, around 200 million customers, ZDNet reported. 3616181]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GENERAL PINEDO, ARGENTINA — An Argentinian man is sadly no longer among the living after he accidentally blasted himself climbing over a fence after failing to off his ex-girlfriend's new boy toy. 

According to local Argentinian media, Anibal Fernandez decided to pop over to his ex Carina Carabajal's place. For a present he decided he would pack some heat in the form of a .22-caliber rifle. 

Fernandez busted into the house and got into a heated argument with Carabajal's new man Daniel Campos. 

That's when Fernandez went all John Wick — minus the headshots and death — and popped Campos four times in the arms and chest. 
Fernandez was all good until he met the fence outside Carabajal's house. Let's just say after failing to climb the fence, Fernandez failed at living.     
Mr. Campos survived and was transported to the hospital were he is recovering. The Las Brenas police force are now investigating the case. 3617249]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GULF SHORES, ALABAMA — In this day and age, you'd think white people would know better than to drop the N-word in public, but one Kendrick Lamar fan clearly didn't get the memo.

People reports that the cringeworthy moment went down at Alabama's Hangout Festival on Sunday. K-dot had invited a couple of fans to rap M.A.A.D City with him — one dude who messed up, and another who totally killed it.

A white female fan named Delaney then came up, but bombed pretty damn hard when she blurted out the N-word three times. Onstage. In front of 30,000 people.

Lamar had to cut the music to ask her to bleep the word. She initially asked 'bro' if she wasn't cool enough, but apologized and begged to stay after clueing in to her slip up.

Despite the audience uproar, Delaney got a second chance. But not being allowed to say the N-word was apparently too much, because she promptly screwed up the song and got booed off the stage anyway.

Twitter was of two minds about the slip, with one camp fully understanding the wrong in blurting out a racial slur.

The others though, just don't get it, saying it's in the lyrics. 3617149]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Japan to release million tons of radioactive water into the Pacific 3616956]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[FUKUSHIMA, JAPAN — Water containing radioactive byproducts have almost filled up the storage tanks at the the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in Japan.

According to Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun, the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant reactor that suffered meltdowns during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami may end up contaminating groundwater. The reactor produces about 160 tons of radioactive water per day. 

The filters that remove radioactive elements from water are not able to remove an element called tritium, thus resulting in the amount of water containing only tritium to steadily increase.

The storage tanks at Fukushima have a capacity of about 1.13 million tons, with about 1.07 million tons of that capacity already filled. Of the space used, 80 percent is occupied by treated water containing tritium.

The area the tanks occupy totals about 230,000 square meters, which is the equivalent of about 32 soccer fields, and there is almost no more expansion space left to allow for more storage.

Officials reportedly have been trying to increase storage capacity by building bigger tanks when it's time to replace the current ones. However, a senior official of Japan's' Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry said this storage method is already close to capacity. 

Tokyo Electric Power Company is planning to secure 1.37 million tons of storage capacity by the end of 2020, but has yet to decide on what to do after 2021. 

Regarding the treated water, TEPCO's chief decommissioning officer Akira Ono said that it is impossible to keep storing it forever. 

The Japan News reports that tritium is produced during regular nuclear plant operations, but also exists in nature. An average of 380 trillion becquerels of treated water containing tritium was released annually into the ocean in the five years before the nuclear plant disaster.

Yomiuri Shimbun reports that the treated water containing tritium at Fukushima measures up to more than 1 million becquerels per liter. This is more than 10 times the national standard allowed for release into the ocean, which is 60,000 becquerels per liter. However, if the water is diluted, it can be released into the sea.

The Japan News reports that a 2016 report by the industry ministry's working group said there are five ways to deal with treated water: releasing it into the sea, evaporation, releasing it after electrolysis, underground burial, or injection into geological layers. Out the five options, releasing it into the sea was seemed as the cheapest and the quickest way to dispose of the water.

An expert committee organized by the ministry says it plans to to hold a public hearing in Fukushima Prefecture and other places to allow local residents to voice their opinions on what to do with the radioactive water. 3616956]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TRONDHEIM, NORWAY —  New research says people on Tinder are interested in short-term relationships but aren't actually hooking up with others.

Researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) surveyed more than 600 students on their social media activity and their sexual behaviors, and determined that the app is just a replacement for trying to hook up with strangers at a bar.

Researchers also observed how men and women typically use apps such as Tinder, and found that women typically spent more time on the app and took their time to consider each person they came across. In comparison, men were much more efficient in their approach, making faster decisions than women.

The researchers also noted that regardless of gender, most people used the app just for entertainment. 3616937]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ROCHESTER, NEW YORK — Breaking into a house isn't the sort of you'd associate with law enforcement but last November a cop told a man to do just that.

Rochester Police were responding to a domestic dispute between the man and his ex-girlfriend.  According to the Democrat and Chronicle, the man wanted to get some of his belongings. 

The paper reports that Officer Korey Mcnees told the man he was within his rights to break into the apartment. After smashing the window, a woman can be seen aiming a rifle out of it.  

The woman aiming the weapon was identified as Catherine Bonner. Bonner said her ex ran over her foot following an argument the night before, something he denies. He's not identified in reports because he wasn't charged.

Bonner meanwhile is facing charges for menacing a police officer. 

The incident was the subject of a New York Supreme Court Case earlier this week during which the judge said the cop's advice was wrong and went against police policy.

The judge said how the cops responded to the rifle was unlawful and should be suppressed, local NBC affiliate WHEC News 10 reported.

The judge added, according to WHEC News 10, that Bonner wasn't read her Miranda rights either and only consented to search after cops began searching unlawfully to find the gun. 

WHEC News 10 reports it's unclear whether the charges against her will be dropped. 3617981]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PYONGYANG, NORTH KOREA — As the maybe yes, maybe no historic U.S. - North Korea summit date rolls closer, both dear leaders have a lot on their minds.  

It appears the Kim Jong Fats is getting real nervous, not about schmoozing with the head cheeto in charge, but that he might get overthrown while he's off frolicking in Singapore. 

According to the Washington Post, Fatty thinks his iron grip could be vulnerable to a military coup or other aspiring lil' dictators if he ain't around. 
President Trump on Tuesday tweeted that there was a substantial chance the June 12 bromance summit to bro all bromances might not happen. 
But then who's going to get the Nobel Peace Prize? 3617874]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[FORMOSA, ARGENTINA — An Argentinian man has spent a whopping $60,000 to transform himself into a mythical being straight out of a Tolkien fantasy.

The Daily Mirror reports that last week, Luis Padron was in Los Angeles to go under the knife to cut and reshape his ears to look pointy, like an elf.

And shortly before that, Padron went all the way to South Korea to get V-line jaw surgery. The doctors had to break his jaw, fill it and screw back his jaw together in order to achieve the perfect diamond shape.

Padron mentioned he has wanted to transform himself into a mythical creature ever since he was a teenager as he used to be bullied and would instead find solace and acceptance in the fantasyworld. 

Padron says he feels much more comfortable with his body. He'll need to wait a few months for all the surgeries heal, but once that's set, it's on to Rivendell!

Padron has more than 50,000 followers on instagram and regularly shares photos of himself in various cosplay.

His ultimate dream is to live out the elf fantasy, so he's hoping get cast in the new Lord of the Rings TV series. 3617833]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — White House lawn maintenance must be scratching their heads this week after a small sinkhole opened on the lawn of 1600 Pennsylvania.

The Washington Post reports that the crevice is getting bigger. Officials have cordoned the hole of with cautionary tape. 

According to Newser, there is another hole opening up next to the first. Both holes are likely the result of heavy rain, a National Parks spokesperson told CNN. 

Officials don't believe the crevices poses any threat, so don't expect to see the White House getting swallowed by the ground.

Purdue University Professor and Weather expert Terry West told CNN that the building's doesn't naturally lend itself to sinkholes He reckons  it's probably due to man-made activities.

During the Obama administration the area reportedly had more than its fair share of construction. 3617751]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY — More than a quarter million gamers have helped one of America's leading universities find out more about neurons.

The Princeton University Eyewire project by saw 265,000 gamers help map more than 3,000 neural cells into a digital museum, the institution wrote in a news release.  

Researchers had players tracing out the structures from ganglion cells in a mouse's eye. Princeton research scholar Shang Mu said these cells are the connection between the retina and the brain. Gamers mapped this by coloring 10 million 3D cubes. 

These cubes, according to Princeton University, are 4.5 microns across, meaning a 10-by-10 block is the width of a human hair. All mapped cells are verified by up to 25 other gamers, and once it's complete they're entered into the Eyewire museum. 3617661]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI — A new study has found that a certain strain of E. coli is more likely to cause traveler's diarrhea in people with blood type A. 

According to the study published on May 17 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the diarrhea-causing strain of E. coli secretes a protein that attaches to sugar molecules on type A blood cells, but not type B or O cells. 

According to Science News, researchers from Washington University School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins University also found these sugar molecules are also present in the gut linings of people with blood type A. 

Scientists had 106 healthy volunteers drink water laced with a strain of E. coli extracted from a person in Bangladesh with severe diarrhea. 

After five days, 81 percent of the type A or AB volunteers developed moderate to severe diarrhea compared to about half with blood types O or B. 
The results could mean that a vaccine targeting the bacterial protein could be effective. 3617556]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[VAR cameras failed as offside goal scored in final before World Cup 3617542]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA — Australia's Football Federation admitted that the Video Assistant Referee technology (VAR) they used encountered a technical failure that led to a controversial goal. 

According to the federation, the incident took place at the grand final of Australia's A league between Melbourne Victory and Newcastle Jets earlier this month. 

When Victory was delivering the ball from a free-kick play, the software that VAR system provider Hawk-eye uses crashed, causing the cameras to partially lose 30 seconds of footage.

During the glitch, three players in the Victory's outfit were already standing in offside position, and the referees did not signal offside either. 

This failure allowed Victory's players to take the chance at controlling the ball, which later led to the controversial goal that helped the team clinch the league title.

Greg O'Rourke, the head of Australia's A-League said the technology failed on this occasion and the broadcast angles required were unavailable. They are working with Hawk-Eye's UK head office to prevent this from happening again.

Hawk-Eye's Australian branch declined to comment on the glitch, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

VAR was introduced as a technology-based solution to correct human referees' errors when they need to make a decision in just split seconds.

Last month, FIFA announced that Hawk-Eye will be the VAR system provider and will feature its camera prominently in all the FIFA World Cup fixtures in Russia this summer. 3617542]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[FRENCH POLYNESIA — The ultimate libertarian fantasy of an autonomous floating habitat could become a reality in just a few years.

CNBC reports that nonprofit organization Blue Frontiers is heading the Floating Island Project, which seeks to build up to 300 homes on a manmade island off the coast of Tahiti.

Despite partnering with and being located in French Polynesia, the floating community will be self-governed and have its own cryptocurrency called Varyon.

The Varyon payment token can be exchanged for goods and services in the Blue Frontiers ecosystem, in other island systems, or between token holders.

Houses on the island are movable, so residents can easily float away to another seastead if they don't want to live under a particular government.

Since land in this region will likely disappear with rising sea levels, organizers say the new island could provide housing for the displaced. The community would also function as a business center, one that's stable and free from government regulation.

Blue Frontier's pilot island is expected to cost up to $50 million, and be up and running by 2022. 3617443]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ITHACA, NEW YORK — A new battery design from Cornell University could charge devices in seconds.

Typical battery design usually consists of a structure with cathode and anode on the ends and electrolyte in between.Electricity flows to out the anode toward whatever its powering, then back through the battery cathode creating a circuit.

New research from Cornell University details a battery design where all the parts intertwine in a 3D structure, surrounded by thousands of energy-storing nano pores. 
The twisting, self-assembling gyrodial is dense with power and eliminates a lot of the weight in traditional batteries and allows for much quicker energy transfer.
 
Speaking in a Cornell news release, lead researcher Dr. Ulrich Wiesner said the nanoscale design could see batteries being charged in seconds, or even faster. 3617435]]></video:description>

Roboticist Dr. David Hanson thinks robots will want their own civil rights by 2038. 

Hanson thinks that advances in AI will lead to smart-machines demanding equals rights compared to humans by 2045.

These rights would include the right to own land, vote, and get married. Might want to tack divorce onto that list.

      <video:description><![CDATA[STAFFORDSHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM — A retired Math teacher has made it his sole mission in life to spread his seed and literally create Britain's next generation.

The Daily Mirror reports that the teacher, named Clive, is one of four 'Super Sperm Donors' featured in a documentary by the UK's Channel Four Television. Clive drives around the country to people in need, handing himself before handing out batches of baby batter right in the back of his van.

Little swimmers can cost thousands at clinics, but Clive's is free. He doesn't discriminate either - same-sex couples, heteros, even single ladies - everyone gets some!

The 62-year-old averages 16 donations a month, and even does repeat visits to couples who don't get a bun baked the first time.

So far, he and his van have fathered 65 kids, with another 14 on the way. Old man's not satisfied though, and wants to go all the way up to a hundred.

Of course, since he doesn't offer sperm through a legit clinic, any of his baby mamas can milk him for child support if they wanted to.

He's not worried, and believes the van operation distances him from the moms and proves he's really just a donor. 

Hope you're right, man. 3618757]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA — K-9 Rye was the department's newest addition and has already made quite the impression. 

It all started when the officers pulled over a silver 2010 Nissan Rogue in West Covina California for a driving violation.As the officers looked into the car, they found what they believed to be meth on the driver's seat.

They called in the newly recruited K-9 to perform a thorough search of the car where he discovered two hidden compartments where 60 pounds of meth were stored.

The meth was apparently hidden in space underneath the driver and front passenger seat.

Police officers immediately arrested Pedro Lopez for possessing and transporting narcotics, setting the bail at $1 million.

Most people on social media reacted positively and praised the dog for doing an awesome job.

Rye had just received his field certification in narcotic detection in April. 3618585]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA — A lawsuit filed in California claims Facebook hasn't been very friendly to its users.

Former startup Six4Three claims that Facebook used its apps for mass  surveillance on users by assembling data from their texts and photos. Six4Three also alleges Facebook used its software to listen to users and remotely powered their Bluetooth to pinpoint locations, sometimes without consent.

Citing the lawsuit, the Guardian reports that Facebook could gather metadata from Android phone texts messages. Six4Three claims that the company could access nearly all photos on iPhones, as well as those not uploaded to Facebook.

The lawsuit also alleges that Facebook also acquired some people's data without their consent.  According to the Guardian, the company allegedly gathered information sent by users not on the platform to people with Facebook apps on their phone. 

Citing the lawsuit, the Huffington post reports Facebook allegedly used information from Onavo, an app it owns, to observe what people used their phones for beyond Facebook.

Facebook has rejected all of the claims from by Six4Three. 3618499]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[FRANCE —French researchers have now confirmed some over 73-year-old remains are linked with Hitler. 

By testing a set of teeth and a bullet-shot chunk of skull believed to be his, which were owned by the Russians and loaned on a temporary basis for study, scientists are now sure Hitler kicked the can back in Berlin at the end of WWII.  

The team compared the teeth fragments to war-ear autopsy records and concluded the chompers definitely belonged to Adolf. 
The results were published in the European Journal of Internal Medicine. 3618489]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Giant hammerhead flatworms are invading France 3618394]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[PARIS — Scientists have discovered that an invasive species of flatworms have been quietly occupying French soil for the past two decades.

The Washington Post reports that they would have gone unnoticed if not for amateur naturalist Pierre Gros, who spotted the strange critters in his garden, and Jean-Lou Justine, a zoologist at France's Museum of Natural History who later identified them as hammerhead flatworms.

According to the journal PeerJ, hammerheads are a giant species of flatworms with shovel-like heads that are native to Asia. They can grow up to a meter long and appear to reproduce asexually.

Citizen sightings indicate that at least three hammerhead species have been in metropolitan France as early as 1999, with two others reported in overseas territories.

The invasive species feed on earthworms in the soil, which they immobilize by secreting small amounts of the paralytic poison tetrodotoxin —  the same neurotoxin found in the potentially lethal Japanese delicacy fugu or puffer fish.

Since earthworms help aerate soil and keep it fertile, scientists worry that the presence of predatory flatworms may threaten biodiversity and drastically affect the ecosystem.

They believe the worms were likely transported to Europe via tropical plants, but remain baffled by how they went undetected for almost 20 years. 3618394]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHESTERFIELD COUNTY, VIRGINIA — Turns out the a Virginia Walmart kidnapping incident was actually a hoax for social media attention.

According to the witnesses, a seafoam green sedan stopped at a Walmart in Midlothian, a man then walked over to open one of the car doors, that's when the trunk popped open and a young woman jumped out of the vehicle and ran off.

Two men then ran out to go after the woman, after recapturing her, they forced her back into the car and sped off. 

On Monday, police released information about the incident and surveillance photos of the female and the males involved in the kidnapping.

Strangely, the woman who was kidnapped and one of her kidnappers walked into the police station to confess the whole thing was a actually hoax, and she came to the station in her vehicle, which was the vehicle used in the apparent kidnap.

Turns out that the female and the four males, who are all either 19 or 20 years old, know each other, after eating dinner nearby the Walmart, the group went to the back of Walmart to plan the whole thing. They planned to film the staged abduction and the reaction of onlookers and post the video on social media.  

Police said many manpower hours were spent on investigating the abduction, and now they are not ruling out charges against the group, Chester Police captain Jay Thornton said it could be anything ranging from a summons type offense to a lower misdemeanor.

Thornton also said that it's they are glad that this whole thing was just a planned event and not something that could have become tragic. 3618185]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WEST PHILIPPINE SEA — Two U.S. Navy warships sailed near the South China Sea islands on Sunday while carrying out freedom of navigation operations, two American officials told Reuters.

The USS Antietam, a guided missile cruiser, and the USS Higgins, a guided-missile destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands. 

The American vessels carried out maneuvering operations close too Tree, Lincoln, Triton and Woody islands in the Paracels, one of the officials told Reuters. 
China said in a statement from the Ministry of National Defense on its website that it confronted the U.S. ships and warned them to leave. 

The chief spokesman for China's Ministry of National Defense, Senior Col. Wu Qian, said that the U.S. gravely violated Chinese sovereignty, according to the New York Times. 

Tensions have been on the rise in the area after China for the first time landed one of its long-range H-6K strategic bombers on one of its man-made island in the Paracels, Woody Island. 3620365]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PARIS — Jaw-dropping footage captured in Paris over the weekend shows the moment  
a man scales four stories of an apartment block to save a dangling child. 

Mamadou Gassama, a Malian migrant, sprang into action after the 4-year-old was spotted on the balcony on Saturday evening. Emergency services were on their way at the time of the video recording. 

The BBC reports the boy's father was questioned by cops for leaving his kid unattended.

Speak to Le Parisien, Gassama said he did it because it was a child, and that he'd do it again. Many praised the young man's heroics, including Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo who thanked him by phone. 

Nearly 5,000 people have signed a Change.org petition set up to help Gassama get residency status and public recognition for his actions.

According to Le Parisien, Gassama is set to meet Emmanuel Macron on Monday morning. 3620343]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[REDDING, CALIFORNIA — A California flight instructor and his assistant attempted to carry out a vigilante deportation on a foreign student, only to be thwarted by police.

The Washington Post reports that Jonathan McConkey and Kelsi Hoser worked at the IASCO Flight Training school in Redding, which was contracted by China's Civil Aviation Authority to train new pilots.

According to a statement from Redding police, the two employees showed up at one trainee's apartment Thursday night, ordering him to pack and be ready to go back to China in the morning.

The trainee, Tianshu Chris Shi, has been in the states for seven months on an M-1 visa, after his university paid IASCO 70 grand to train him. He'd been grounded for the past two months though, and thinks it's due to his limited English.

Shi refused to leave when the pair came back the next morning, and was threatened by McConkey, who grabbed his arm and bent him over the kitchen island.

He managed to call his brother in Shanghai for help before being taken away. The brother then called the cops to report the kidnapping.

Redding police officers found Shi at the municipal airport, rescuing him before he could be loaded onto a plane, and arresting his captors.

McConkey and Hoser had planned to fly the 21-year-old to the Bay Area and put him on another plane to China. They've since been charged with conspiracy and kidnapping. 3620308]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MIAMI, FLORIDA — In a video shot by an American Airlines passenger, a man is seen screaming at a flight attendant after he is denied alcohol.

An FBI affidavit states that around an hour after the flight took off from St Croix to Miami, passenger Jason Felix called on the flight attendant to purchase another beer.

The flight attendant refused after he caught Felix scouring through the back of the plane opening and closing cabinets in the bathroom earlier during the flight, the Independent reported.

When a flight attendant confronted him, he seemed upset and was swearing at the flight attendant on his way back to his seat. 

The FBI says when his request for another drink was turned down, Felix started chasing the flight attendants and used inappropriate language.

The crew informed Felix that he would need to sit down told him that he would not be drinking anymore beers.

Bill Bolduc, who recorded the incident, claims Felix then started hitting his seatmate in aisle, spitting blood and tearing his shirt, while the other passengers tried to pull them apart.

It turns out the seatmate Felix was fighting with was a U.S. Virgin Islands police officer. The FBI says Felix threatened to kill him and said I know you are a cop.

Fellow passengers tried to calm Felix down but he continued with the insults and the use of inappropriate language toward the police officer, who had been asked to change seats. 

When the plane landed in Miami, four police officers came onto the plane and escorted Felix into the airport where he was immediately arrested for attempted to interfere with the flight crew.

He could be sentenced upto 20 years in jail. Meanwhile, his detention hearing is on Tuesday in Florida. 3620205]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CABIN MOUNTAINS, MONTANA — A woman is lucky to be alive after getting up close and personal with a grizzly bear.

According to the BBC, Amber Kornak had just started working as a seasonal grizzly bear wildlife technician in the Cabinet Mountains in Montana. That's where the bear attacked from behind

The Associated Press reports she was gathering DNA samples near a stream at the time of the attack. As the animal got physical, Kornak reached for some bear mace and doused the animal with it. Some of it got on her as well, according to the AP. 

She received a cracked skull, as well as some serious cuts to her head and neck. However she still managed to walk 2 miles back to her vehicle and proceeded to drive for help. Reportedly, she's currently in stable condition.

A Go Fund Me page was set up to help Amber with her recovery. So far it's raised nearly $36,500 of its $50,000 goal. 3620124]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Shocking shark video prompts calls for banning drift nets 3620118]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA — Disturbing footage of a shark being bludgeoned by a fisherman has lead to increased calls for a ban on drift gill nets in commercial fishery.

The Mercury News reports that the video was taken by an undercover activist and posted online by Mercy for Animals, and comes as two California senators introduced a bill to ban the nets nationwide.

Drift gill nets are long walls of meshed synthetic netting held vertically in the water by floats along the top and weights on the bottom.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, fish are caught when their gills get stuck in the mesh openings, the sizes of which vary depending on the type of fish being targeted.

But non-target animals, called bycatch, are also captured. Sharks, dolphins, and sea lions often get tangled in the net and are unable to free themselves, leading to death or serious injury.

Drift net fishermen claim the industry has implemented measures to reduce bycatch, including using nets with larger openings and electronic devices to scare off dolphins.

Still, opponents say the casualties are unnecessary and unacceptable, believing that phasing them out is the best way to stop the horror. 3620118]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Only 1% of Japan's biggest coral reef is healthy 3620113]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[JAPAN —  Rising sea temperatures have impacted the ability of Japan's biggest coral reef to recover from bleaching, resulting in only one percent of the reef being in good health, according to a new study. 

Bleaching can occur due to changing environmental conditions such as rising sea temperatures and causes coral to expel tiny photosynthetic algae which drains them of their color. 

Since the 1980s, the volume of coral in Sekisei Lagoon near Okinawa has plummeted by nearly 80 percent. 

The coral has been damaged by starfish eating coral and rising ocean temperatures, according to Japan Today.

The latest study shows that the corals haven't recovered much since 2008 due to the 1998, 2001, 2007, and 2016 bleaching events. 

The lagoon itself is around 67.89 square kilometers with only around 1.4 percent of its corals still healthy. 

Coral reefs are home to 25 percent of marine life even though they only make up 1 percent of the marine environment.

The only way the corals would be able to recover is if the temperature in the ocean drops and algaes are able to colonise them again, reports AFP. 3620113]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CLEVELAND, TENNESSEE — A Tennessee family woke up terrified one morning earlier this month when DEA agents and a SWAT team mistakenly raided their house.

Spencer Renck claimed in a Facebook post that he heard loud banging noises at 5:50 a.m. and thought someone was breaking into his home.

He grabbed his gun and ran upstairs, only to come face to face with the Bradley County SWAT team — their guns drawn and pointed at him. They tackled the father of four and told him he was under arrest for murder.

It wasn't until 20 minutes later that agents realized they had the wrong guy. They left the house without a word and nabbed the real murder suspect next door, reports WTVC.

Renck says agents destroyed his house during the raid. They busted up the door, blew out the ceiling, and burned the floor and hallway. They'd also thrown flash bang grenades inside the property, one of which temporarily blinded and deafened his young son.

A supervisor later came back to apologize for the mix-up, but the damage had already been done.

Authorities are still trying to figure out who messed up, and the sheriff's office hasn't said who'll be paying for damages. 3621222]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Astronomers find 'exo-asteroid' from outside the solar system 3621145]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[THE COSMIC NEIGHBORHOOD — Astronomers this month detailed a piece of rock orbiting around Jupiter that is of interstellar origins.

That means the object came from somewhere outside our solar system and because of that, it's called an 'exo-asteroid.'

The object, called 2015 BZ09, orbits the sun and passes by Jupiter, but in a weird way. Study author Dr. Helena Morais explained to CNN that both celestial bodies take around the same time to orbit the sun, but move in opposing directions: clockwise, and counterclockwise, meaning they pass each other twice.

According to Cosmos Magazine, the exo-asteroid has been doing that for 4.5 billion years and will continue to do so forever. 

Last year scientists found this interstellar object passing through our cosmic neighborhood. Called Oumumua, this was said to be the solar system's first interstellar visitor. 

In other words, Oumumua is tourist, but the exo-asteroid, because of its orbit, isn't going anywhere.

Details of the exo-asteroid was published in the journal, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters. 3621145]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — The FBI has issued a formal warning that a Russia-linked hacking campaign compromised hundreds of thousands of home wireless routers.

The agency is advising people reboot their devices to disrupt the malware.

The sneaky software looks to be targeting small or home offices with a botnet called VPNFilter, according to the Hill. 

Officials and cybersecurity experts say VPNFilter may have infected as many as 500,000 devices globally. 

In the alert, the bureau's cyber division wrote, owners are advised to consider disabling remote management settings on devices and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Network devices should be upgraded to the latest available versions of firmware.   

Officials also said last week, the malware appears to be linked to the cyber espionage group APT 28 or Sofacy. Some cybersecurity firms say the hacking group is sponsored by Mother Russia. 

VPNFilter could cause problems in various ways, from stealing website credentials to causing widespread internet disruptions. 3621029]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[JIAXING, CHINA —  A suspect was recently caught with the help of facial recognition software when he entered a concert venue in eastern China.

Reported by China's Shinmin[e] Daily News, the suspect was one of 20,000 people attending a concert by pop star Jacky Cheung Sunday evening in Jiaxing, China. 

According to Nanhu District Public Security Bureau, a few minutes after the suspect passed through the scanner, the system issued a warning that he was a wanted person.

Reports from China's state-run new agency Xinhua complimented the system's effectiveness, saying it can verify people's identities at airport security in less than one second. 

Global Times, another state-run agency, reported that the system has also been used to monitor students' attentiveness at school, with one student quoted as saying that he's more focused and doesn't dare fool around in class anymore.

With the help of the AI recognition system, authorities were able to quickly arrest the person while a massive crowd exited the concert venue. 

The man, who authorities identified only by his last name, Yu[f], is accused of taking around US$17,000 worth of potatoes in 2015 without paying them. 

Yu is actually the third person arrested at a Jacky Cheung concert. In April, a man identified as Ao[g] was arrested during a Jacky Cheung concert in Nanchang, and earlier this month, a man surnamed Liu was identified by authorities at another one of Cheung's concerts in Ganzhou[h]. 3620887]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WILDWOOD, NEW JERSEY — A Jersey police officer was caught on camera getting into a violent altercation with a suspected 20-year-old underage female drinker.

The two Wildwood cops involved in the incident have been put on desk duty until an internal investigation can be completed, according to The Inquirer. 
Footage of the arrest went viral over the weekend, and shows a Wildwood officer punching 20-year-old Emily Weinman of Philadelphia twice, once in the head and another in the neck. 

Then for fun the officer decided to put the woman in a chokehold. And why not? Weinman was busted by the po po for underage drinking. 

Weinman is facing a count of aggravated assault on an officer and being a minor in possession of alcohol.
According to Wildwood Mayor Ernie Troiano Jr, the police will soon release body camera footage of Weinman insulting and spitting on the po po. 3620817]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON — An in-development video game simulating school shooter scenarios has been dropped from sale.

Active Shooter, by Revived Games, was set for originally release on game distribution platform Steam on June 6 2018.  

The game’s premise upset and anger many people. According to CNN, mothers and fathers of victims in the Parkland, Florida shooting criticized the game, as did lawmakers.

Valve Corp, owners of Steam, pulled the game, its developer, and publisher from the platform, but not apparently because the game was controversial.

A Valve rep told Kotaku the following, quote: “This developer and publisher is, in fact, a 
person calling himself Ata Berdiyev, who had previously been removed last fall when he was operating as ‘[bc]Interactive’ and ‘Elusive Team,’”.

The rep also called the developer a” troll” with a “history of customer abuse, publishing copyrighted material and user review manipulation.”

According to Destructoid, Revived Games entire catalogue was removed from Steam. Their other titles reportedly included White Power: Pure Voltage and Tyde Pod Challenge. 3621876]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TEXAS — The latest search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is now coming to an end, reports The BBC.

Private company, Texas-based Ocean Infinity, used deep-sea vessels to survey the southern Indian ocean, but nothing was found.

Flight MH370 mysteriously disappeared four years ago while it was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

It is still unclear what actually happened to the flight. Officials ended their search efforts last year as there was only limited information about its last hours, The BBC reports.

However, there are some people who are opposed to ending the search.

Grace Nathan said her mother was on MH370 and noted that it is important for people to remember that MH370 is not history, reports The Guardian.

A report into the plane's mysterious disappearance is expected to be published sometime in the future, according to The BBC.

Australia, China, and Malaysia have agreed to resume an official search only if credible evidence is found, The BBC reports. 3621833]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PORT MORESBY, PAPUA NEW GUINEA — As concerns over Facebook rise across Asia, a South Pacific nation is considering temporarily shutting down Facebook, supposedly to figure out how to regulate it.

The Papua New Guinea Post-Courier reports that the government of Papua New Guinea wants to ban the social network for a full month, citing research and analysis.

Communication Minister Sam Basil claims it's to crackdown on fake users and filter out information that's false or misleading.

But some are doubting the government's intentions, saying the move seems fishy.

ABC Online reports officials have been pretty sensitive to criticism, and at least one opposition MP thinks the ban may be used to weed out and silence dissenters on social media.

Basil didn't seem to mind a permanently Facebook-less Papua New Guinea either, and thinks making the nation its own social network site might be a good idea. 3621726]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PEEBLESSHIRE, SCOTLAND — A hospital in Scotland has begun treating people that are addicted to trading cryptocurrencies. 

Castle Craig Hospital is now using techniques used to treat gambling addictions and applying them to traders obsessed with the price of their Bitcoin, Ethereum or whatever new digital currency that just hit the market this week.

According to one of the hospital's gambling therapists, Chris Burn, the high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation. 3621712]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Kim Jong-un's top nuclear weapons negotiator is on his way to the Big Apple and is going to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to get things set for the on-again June 12 summit in Singapore. 

Trump tweeted that Kim Yong-chol was on his way, also adding, Solid response to my letter, thank you!

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Tuesday that Pompeo would meet Kim this week. 

According to the New York Times, Kim's visit would be the highest-ranking North Korean official to be state side since 2000. 
 
Oh yeah, Mr. Kim also popped by Beijing on Tuesday for some reason. He probably didn't meet with anyone in the CCP or get any type of marching orders. 
Maybe the June 12 summit should be between the real players at the table — the U.S. and China. 3621701]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO — Last week Ethan Klein of H3H3productions blasted YouTube over a experiment they're working on with the website's subscription feed.

The subscription feed is where users get the raw chronological content from channels they've subscribed to. 

Klein noticed a comment from a Twitter user complaining about their subs feed, to which YouTube responded saying they were doing some testing with a small number of users with personalized content replacing most recent content first.

Klein complained YouTube was taking away the one place for users where they knew what they were getting. Currently users get recommended, trending, what to watch next  and, if you're a registered YouTube user, your subscription feed. 

YouTube's experiment was playing with the idea of putting more personalized content first vs the most recent video. YouTube also said the feature was optional, but as Dexterto.com reports, the website's optimization has left creators and users alike worried about the future user-friendliness of the website. 3621633]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM — A woman broke her arm in an arm-wrestling event at the Young Farmers' Clubs Northern District Field Day in Irthington on Saturday.

There were a total of 120 competitions and 15 clubs from the north and west Cumbria regions competing in various challenges.

Some 800 young farmers were at the field day event, which involved competitions from sheep shearing to flower arranging, the BBC reported.

During an arm-wrestling challenge, a 20-year-old woman was taking part with another girl when her arm broke. When her opponent realized what had happened, she reportedly fainted. 

Andrew Dickinson, who provided medical help onsite, said it was a bad break and she was in a lot of pain.

However, the paramedic also reiterated that they made the woman comfortable and administered the correct treatment until the ambulance arrived.

The injured woman was taken by the ambulance to Cumberland Infirmary.

Dickinson said the opponent was very upset because of what had happened, but added that other than the incident, the day was fantastic. 3621629]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[VOLUSIA COUNTY, FLORIDA — A Florida woman passed a note asking for help against armed boyfriend to staff in an animal hospital last Friday.

It read: Call the cops. My boyfriend is threatening me. He has a gun. Please don't let him know.

It was written on a note by Carolyn Reichle and passed to a worker at Deland Animal Hospital last Friday afternoon.

According to Volusia County Sheriff's Office, her boyfriend is 38-year-old Jeremy Floyd. Police suspect he beat Reichle and held her against her will. 

Floyd and Reichel's story begins Wednesday night at his single-story home on the 900 block of South Amelia Avenue in Volusia. Both had been arguing. 

The Washington Post reports that Floyd told police that Reichle dove head first out of the bedroom window. Reichle said she ran and Floyd chased her, he says he carried her back inside. 

On the same night both got into a fight over a gun Floyd was allegedly threatening Reichle with. It went off.  Police say investigating officers found two bullet holes in a hallway when visiting the property.

According to WFTV.COM, Reichle was in bed the next with a head injury. Police say Floyd wasn't letting her leave

On the Friday, she convinced Floyd to take her and her dog to Deland Animal Hospital.  On the drive there, police say he threatened her at gunpoint. 

When they got to the animal hospital, the Post reports that Reichle managed to get away from Floyd for some time during which she passed staff the note asking for help. They complied with the note's request and the cops soon arrived to find Floyd and a crying Reichle.

Floyd was charged with aggravated assault with a firearm, false imprisonment, possession  of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of ammunition by a convicted felon and simple battery.  According to the Post, this is Floyd's 14th time in jail. 

On Saturday Volusia Sheriff Mike Chitwood praised Reichle's actions in a tweet. He wrote: Thank God for the courage of this woman, the quick action of staff at DeLand Animal Hospital and the work of our deputies and DeLand PD. 3621541]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM — A grown man had to call the police and the fire department to rescue him after he got stuck in a playground swing, the BBC reported.

Apparently the 20-year-old had already been stuck on the swing for three hours at Landseer Park in Ipswich before authorities arrived at 7:50 a.m.

The police tried using the shove and pull method to release the swing. It didn't work as his bottom was too wide. The fire department was then called, and they arrived with a screwdriver.

The crew from the Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service dismantled the swing to pieces and released the man.

They then put the swing back together so it could be safely used by someone of the right size. the Sun reported.

The man said that he was grateful but embarrassed.

The Ipswich East Police tweeted the pictures of the incident and reminded people to always use age appropriate play equipment. 3621403]]></video:description>
