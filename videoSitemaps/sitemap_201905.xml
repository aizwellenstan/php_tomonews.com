      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT — A new study suggests that the Moon might have been formed after a Mars-sized rock hit a magma-covered proto-Earth. 

According to Space.com, the moon's formation is typically explained through the 'Giant Impact Hypothesis'. This theory suggests that the moon is a result of a collision between early Earth and another embryonic planet roughly the size of Mars called Theia.

Computer simulations indicate that if this theory were true, 60 percent of the moon would be made from sediments from Theia. However, samples of lunar material show more similarities with sediments from Earth.

A new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience poses another hypothesis. Researchers participating in the study explain that roughly 50 million years ago early Earth was covered in magma when it was hit by a solid object.

Through a computer simulation, they observed that as the object hit Earth, magma from the Earth's surface expanded and went into orbit, forming the moon.

According to their model, roughly 80 percent of the resulting moon is made up of proto-Earth materials.

Study lead author Natsuki Hosono told Space.com, quote, 'Prior work on lunar formation basically ignored the effect of the magma ocean. Our research concluded that the magma ocean is one of the most important things for the moon-forming giant impact.' 3821455]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[INGA, NORWAY — Marine experts in Norway believe they have discovered a white whale that was trained by the Russian navy as part of a program that uses underwater mammals as a special ops force. Whale—that would be something. 
According to the Guardian, fishermen near the Norwegian fishing town of Inga reported seeing a white beluga whale wearing a unique harness that began to harass their fishing boats. 
The fishermen said the whale was acting strangely and looking for boats and trying to pull straps and ropes from the sides of the boat.  
According to the Guardian, the tight harness seemed to be made for a camera or possibly some kind of weapon.
Inside the harness, which was removed from the whale, it said Equipment of St. Petersburg. 
Audun Rikardsen, professor at the department of arctic and marine biology at the Arctic University of Norway, said he had contacted Russian researchers who told him they had nothing to do with the harnessed whale. 
Rikardsen said the researchers told them it was most likely the Russian navy in Murmansk. 
Now it they found some sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads, now that would be over-whale-ming. 3821442]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[VIENTIANE, LAOS —  China has already begun building a railroad that would connect Laos' capital, Vientiane, to China's Yunnan province but the construction has sparked fear of debt among Laotians.

According to a statement published on China's Belt and Road Initiative official page, the China-Laos Railway will measure 414 kilometers, connecting Vientiane and China's Yunnan province.

It is designed for trains to travel at 160 kilometers per hour, making it possible to travel from Yunnan to Vientiane in just 3 hours. The railway is expected to be fully operational in December 2021.

The project is part of the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese development strategy involving infrastructure development and investment in 152 countries.   

According to an NPR report, the total cost of building the high-speed railroad is $6 billion, of which China will pay 70 percent. The Laotian government will finance the rest of the project through loans from Chinese financial institutions. 3821224]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA — A Taiwan-based bubble tea chain owes staff millions of dollars in underpaid earnings, according to an investigation by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

The newspapers claim they owe workers over $10m Australian dollars (over $7 million USD). The newspapers allege that Chatime and its Australian franchise network, Infinite Plus aka Chatime Australia, have been underpaying staff for years.  The scandal is said to stretch as far back as 2009 in some cases.

The Age reports most of the affected workers are students from Taiwan and China.  Apparently, many don't take the matter up with the authorities because they don't want to be deported as their visas didn't allow for work. 3821193]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[5G wireless networks could interfere with weather forecasts 3821158]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SILVERSPRING, MARYLAND — 5G wireless networks could interfere with technology that uses satellites to make accurate weather forecasts.

Weather satellites predict the weather by observing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, according to a new study published in the journal Nature.

However, meteorologists are worried as 5G networks use wireless radio frequencies that could interfere with data collection.

This is because water vapor is measured at the 23.8 gigahertz frequency, which is when it gives off a faint signal in the atmosphere.

According to a 2010 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, losing access to the 23.8-gigahertz signal would cause 30 percent of data that contributes to global weather forecasts to be eliminated.

The network transmits at nearly the same frequency as weather satellites and could produce a signal that looks like that of water vapor, according to the study.

This could result in inaccurate weather forecasts.

The US government has already begun auctioning sections off 5G wireless frequencies to companies, with the most recent one being between 24.25 and 24.45 gigahertz and another one being between 24.75 and 25.25 gigahertz.

According to the study, the next 5G auction will take place later this year, in December. 3821158]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS — Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have designed a tiny robot that could help nanoparticles efficiently deliver drugs to disease sites.

These magnetic microrobots will propel through the bloodstream and drag the nanoparticle to its target site, according to a news release by MIT.

The robots used in the study were 35 hundreths of a millimeter long. They were printed via a 3D printer and then coated with nickel, making them magnetic. This allows them to be controlled via an external magnetic field.

The researchers applied a magnetic field onto the tiny robot which allowed it to rotate as it traveled through the bloodstream, creating a convection current.

The researchers mainly used the nanoparticles to target disease sites around blood vessels that are leaky such as tumors. 

According to the MIT news release, the magnetic robots allowed the nanoparticles to penetrate twice as far into the tissue compared to particles that were delivered without the help of the robot.

Sangeeta Bhatia, senior author of the study, said this approach could be used to reduce swelling at the site of a stent as they are stationary and would be easy to target using an external magnetic field. 3821136]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ITALY — European telecommunications giant Vodafone found some strange stuff inside its Huawei equipment several years ago, Bloomberg reports.

According to Bloomberg, Vodafone says the issues are now resolved. However, all of this  certainly doesn't look good for China's tech giant. 

The company is said to have found issues with tech supplied by Huawei for its business in Italy. 

Citing security briefing documents by Vodafone from 2009 and 2011, Bloomberg reports, the company discovered hidden backdoors in Huawei's software. These could have given the Huawei unauthorized access to Vodafone's fixed-line network in Italy. 

The European company explained it found backdoors in its optical services nodes and its broadband network gateway. 

Vodafone identified 26 open bugs in Huawei's routers. Six of them were said to be critical' while nine were referred to as major. 

The company said Huawei needed to remove or inhibit its telnet protocol in the routers, as it was found giving unauthorized access to its Wide Area Network or WAN.

Vodafone said it asked Huawei to remove backdoors present in home routers, however they never did despite saying they would. 

According to Bloomberg, a backdoor refers to a way of bypassing security measures in order to gain access to a computer system or even encrypted data. 

Citing the internal Vodafone documents, Bloomberg reports this was a risk for the company as third-parties could potentially access a client's personal computer or network. 

In a statement to Bloomberg, Vodafone defended Huawei saying that there wasn't any evidence of user data being compromised and said that it couldn't find evidence of historical vulnerabilities...beyond Italy. 3821820]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA['MURICA — Plant-based eaters, rejoice, for the Impossible Whopper is about to hit all Burger King's across the US.

According to the Associated Press, Burger King first launched the 0 percent meat burger a month ago in 59 restaurants in St. Louis, where it was very well received, and is now planning to expand to the rest of its US stores.

The Impossible Whopper is made in partnership with Impossible Foods Inc., a company that makes meals using plant-based materials instead of meat and dairy.

The meatless patty is made of heme, a protein composed of soybean roots that has a similar texture to beef.

Surprisingly, the Impossible Whopper is not really targeted towards vegan or vegetarian consumers. CNN reports that the company mainly wants to offer meat eaters the chance to have a burger every day without necessarily having to consume beef.

Burger King is not the first fast-food restaurant to tap into the plant-based market.
According to Today, back in March, McDonald's tested vegan McNuggets made with a mix of mashed potatoes, chickpeas, onions, carrots, and corn.

Vox reports that back in April, Del Taco also dabbled in plant-based cuisine when it partnered with Beyond Meat to create vegan and vegetarian meat alternatives in their menu.

There's a reason why plant-based eating is becoming more popular, and no, it's not because of Peta's crazy protests. 

Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in plant-based alternatives.

According to a report by market research firm, Mintel, roughly six in 10 American consumers are interested in eating less meat, citing health concerns as their main motivation.

Burger King's 7,200 American branches will feature the Impossible Whopper by the end of the year. 3821799]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BANGKOK — Fitness gurus will tell you abs are made in the kitchen, but in Bangkok, they're made at the plastic surgeons.

Plastic surgery clinics in Bangkok are helping clients upgrade their midsection from flab to fab by using the power of the scalpel — and roughly $3,700 from their patients, of course.

According to Coconuts Bangkok, there's been rising interest from idiots who want to sit through a three-hour procedure to get completely fake abs.  

Masterpiece Hospital is one of the medical centers in the city that offers this social media friendly procedure.

Raweewat Maschamadol, the CEO of said hospital told Coconuts Bangkok that they get, quote, 'anywhere from 20 to 30 customers requesting a six-pack every month.' That's a lot of lazy rich people.

Funny thing is, clients walk in wanting rock hard abs and come out with pudgy mounds of fat instead. There's no silicon or plastic involved, all the procedure does is etch the fat on the patient's stomach to shape it into a six-pack. But hey, if it's for the gram, it's all good if it's fake. 

Thai model, Ome Pangpaparn, got his six-pack of flab through this ultra-manly procedure and candidly shared his results on Thai forum Pantip, but we'll save you from those deep thoughts. 3821797]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM — Damage to the soil has been found to be a major contributor to climate change, according to a yet-to-be released report from the United Nations.

There is three times more carbon present in the soil than in earth's atmosphere, BBC News reports.

Carbon in the soil is being released into the atmosphere due to poor farming and deforestation, according to an Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report that will be published on May 6.

This would impact the climate in two ways: it would interfere with plant growth as it takes in carbon from the atmosphere and releases carbon previously stored in the soil.

Erosion, machinery, or over-watering can cause damage to the soil, according to BBC News.

Professor Jan Rickson from Cranfield University told BBC News, that only 3 percent of the earth's surface can be used for arable production while 75 billion tons of fertile soil is lost every year due to land degradation.

According to the BBC, major areas for global soil degradation include South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India and China. 3821744]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — Two seagulls are now internet famous after photobombing and livening up an otherwise dull view of London traffic.

According to Metro, the sassy fowls have been repeatedly filmed popping up in front of the camera near East London's Blackwall Tunnel.

Transport for London or TFL posted the first gull sighting on the their Traffic News Twitter account on Monday. The photo shows a single seagull staring the camera down like a boss.

A day later, another bird sighting prompted a second post from TFL. But it wasn't until the third post that feathers were truly ruffled, with a video showing the seagull appear to be talking to the camera - no doubt making commentary on the road.

He's even joined by a gull pal later on, and the two hilariously play it up in front of the camera.

The pair's antics amused Twitter to no end, and spawned a whole lotta funny comments and reactions.

TFL has since nicknamed its new traffic correspondents Graeme and Steve, and thanked them for helping out at beak times.

After all, who better to give a bird's eye view of a situation than an actual bird. 3822636]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — Scientists in the UK have created a 'biosolar leaf' that could potentially suck up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, The Guardian reports.

 London's Imperial College and technology startup Arborea are collaborating to build a 'biosolar leaf' that would be capable of removing greenhouse gases while generating oxygen to disperse into the air.

Arborea founder, Julian Melchiorri, told the Guardian that this new technology is able to process carbon dioxide at an extremely low pressure.

According to an Imperial College London news release, the biosolar leaf was made by a cultivation system that is able to grow tiny plant life such as microalgae and phytoplankton onto a solar panel-like structure.

The developers claim that this technology could do the work of 100 trees while only using the surface area of one. They eventually plan to place the structures onto the roofs of large buildings in cities to improve air quality.

The Biosolar Leaf cultivation system will be used on the college's White City Campus South Site as a test pilot, According to the Imperial College London news release. 3822267]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  —SpaceX has received authorization to reduce the number of satellites in its home broadband constellation from 4,425 to 4,409,  according to a statement released by the Federal Communications Commission. 

SpaceX's satellite internet network project, Starlink, plans on deploying thousands of satellites that will connect with one million ground stations on Earth, providing internet access worldwide.

The FCC also allowed the company to run 1,584 of its satellites at a lower altitude than previously approved going from 1,150 kilometers to 550 kilometers, despite fear of interference and collisions with other satellites operating at the same altitude. 

According to the FCC, permitting these changes make it easier for SpaceX to deliver internet services in remote areas more quickly and efficiently. Half of the satellites are expected to be launched by 2024 and the official rollout of all satellites is expected in three to five years. 3822231]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[DARWIN, AUSTRALIA — Australian wildlife rangers found a strange three-eyed snake, reports NT News.

Some spiritual gurus spend years learning how to open their third eye, but this little guy was born with it.

According to NT News, the cyclops snake was found by wildlife rangers from Australia's Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission crawling off a highway in a town called, get this, Humpty Doo.

The Commission named the weird viper, Monty Python, and shared photos of him on their Facebook explaining that the snake was a youngster measuring about 40 centimeters long.

They thought the lump over the creepy critter's head was a second skull, but X-rays showed it was actually a third eye-socket and that the three eyes were fully functional. Definitely makes it more of a challenge sneaking up on this one.

The rangers reckon that the extra eye was formed naturally during the snake's embryonic stage of development.

Sadly, we will never know if Monty Python's third eye possessed super powers because he died shortly after being rescued. Ray Chatto, one of the rangers, told NT News that Monty was 'struggling to feed before he died last week' because of his deformity. Rest in peace, creepy buddy. 3822208]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SURIGAO DEL NORTE, PHILIPPINES — A cafe in the Philippines has received global attention for using a 'Lukay' straw in the place of plastic straws, according to Inquirer.net. 

The eco-friendly straws are made from palm or coconut leaves. 

Sarah Tiu, the manager of Cafe Editha told Inquirer she got inspired by the locals after going on a family trip to Corregidor Island in Siargao[e][f], Philippines. There she saw the locals cutting up the leaves and making straws. 

Tiu said she was aiming to make her cafe plastic-free so this was the perfect solution. She said she had previously tried to use stainless steel straws and paper straws in her cafe but customers didn't enjoy them.  Tiu started using the Lukay straws in her cafe just this week and shared photos on Facebook. 

The post went viral and online commentators were quick to react, praising her for the aesthetics and the eco-friendly nature of the straw. 

Previously, supermarkets in Thailand and Vietnam were in the news for their eco-friendly vegetable packaging which used coconut leaves. 3822137]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[XIAHE, CHINA — The discovery of a jawbone in the Tibetan plateau reveals new details about a mysterious race of ancient humans.

According to a study published in Nature, a jaw fossil with two unusually large teeth was found in Baishya Karst Cave in Xiahe, China by a local monk in 1980.

Recent analysis of proteins extracted from one of the molars indicates that the fossil is 160,000 years old, and belongs to a hominin population known as the Denisovans.

This race of humans were first discovered in 2010 by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology via a finger bone from Russia's Denisova Cave.

The New York Times reports that based on their DNA, the Denisovans shared a common ancestor with the Neanderthals some 400,000 years ago, later interbreeding with them and with modern humans. Traces of their DNA are found in present-day Asians, Australians, and Melanesians.

The fossil discovery suggests Denisovans had adapted to living in the low oxygen, high-altitude environment of the Tibetan plateau, which sits at an elevation of 10,760 feet.

According to the Institute of Tibetan research, this genetic adaptation was likely passed on to modern Himlayan populations, who were found to have a Denisovan gene that allows them to cope with thin air.

According to the New York Times, the jawbone is the first Denisovan fossil found outside Denisova Cave, and supports the theory that the species once lived across central and east Asia. 3823232]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[STANFORD, CALIFORNIA — A billionaire Chinese family is revealed to have paid the biggest known sum in the college admissions scandal  — a whopping $6.5 million to get their kid into Stanford.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the family of former Stanford sophomore Yusi Zhao had forked the millions over to Rick Singer, the college consultant at the center of the fraud.

Yusi's father Tao Zhao is chairman of Chinese multibillion dollar pharma company Shandong Buchang. According to Forbes, he's one of the 200 richest men in China.

In a March court hearing, lead prosecutor Eric Rosen said Singer had tried to get the girl into Stanford through its sailing team using falsified sailing achievements.

She didn't end up getting recruited, but was supposedly admitted to the school partly on the basis of those bogus credentials. Singer later donated $500,000 to the sailing program after her admission.

Yusi Zhao is no longer at Stanford. The New York Times reports that the university rescinded her admission in April, in light of the falsified application.

According to The Stanford Daily, none of the Zhaos have been formally charged. It's unclear whether the parents knew that Singer's scheme was illegal, or whether the daughter knew about her parents' involvement with the consultant.

The LA Times reports that a Hong Kong lawyer claiming to represent Mrs. Zhao released a statement on her behalf, which states that Singer merely provided educational advisory services, and did not guarantee admission to any school.

When her daughter was admitted into Stanford, Singer asked her to donate to the school through a foundation he operated. She gave the $6.5 million after being told it would fund scholarships, among other things, and only later realized she'd been duped. 3823226]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIWAN —  As if there weren't already enough cooks in the kitchen, Taiwan's presidential election just got a lot hotter and a whole lot more crowded. 
With Foxconn founder Terry Gou throwing his newly designed Trump-style hat into the ring, the taxi ride to the presidential office just took a massive detour. 
President Tsai Ing-wen is facing a slight uphill battle in her quest for a second term, especially with former Premier William Lai both vying for the DPP candidacy. 
On the KMT side, Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kou-yu was the clear front-runner before Terry got a call from the sea goddess Matsu telling him to run. 

With Terry in the driver's seat, Taiwan would take a hard pivot toward China, away from the U.S. and Japan. 
The billionaire will dangle his checkbook and no doubt push for a peace treaty with Beijing. 

But Taiwan can rest assured—because it will obviously come with NO strings attached. 3823137]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA['Biodegradable' plastic bags aren't biodegrading 3823107]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[PLYMOUTH, ENGLAND — Researchers from the University of Plymouth found that some biodegradable bags do not break down even after three years of natural exposure.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration states that it could take hundreds of years for human-made products to breakdown, depending on the type of materials they're made from and the conditions they are exposed to.

Biodegradable plastic bags seem to be an eco-friendly answer to our plastic problem, but a recent study has revealed that they may not be living up to the hype. 

According to the study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, they compared five different types of bags: two kinds of oxo-biodegradable bags, a biodegradable bag, a compostable bag, and a normal plastic bag.

The team exposed the bags to air, water, and soil for extended periods of time to test their rate of degradation.

Results showed that after three years of exposure to soil, the biodegradable, oxo-biodegradable and normal plastic bags could still be used to carry things without breaking apart.

The compostable bag broke down completely in water within three months but was still present in soil after 27 months of exposure.

Truth is, just buying and using biodegradable products doesn't ensure these will break down more easily. The researchers emphasized that a lot of it has to do with how you dispose of said products.

For example, compostable bags do breakdown if they are, well, disposed of in compostable waste, but not all countries have compostable waste systems.

Richard Thompson, a professor involved in the research said in a press release, It concerns me that these novel materials also present challenges in recycling. Our study emphasizes the need for standards relating to degradable materials, clearly outlining the appropriate disposal pathway and rates of degradation that can be expected. 3823107]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BANGKOK — Thailand's crop toppin' King Vajiralongkorn has taken the plunge with his head bodyguard.

According to the BBC, the announcement came out of left field before his massive coronation bash kicks off on Saturday.
An official announcement in the Royal Gazette said Suthida Vijiralongkorn Na Ayudhya legally tied the knot with the 66-year-old king, and is henceforth Queen Suthida. 
According to CBS News, the 40-year-old queen used to be a flight attendant for Thai Airways. The two love birds apparently met on a flight. 
In 2014, Vajiralongkorn made Suthida deputy commander of his bodyguard unit. Then in December 2016, he bumped her up to full general in the army.

Super exciting video from the wedding was shown on Thai TV with the Crop Topper pouring sacred water on the head of Queen Suthida. The two then signed a marriage registry. 
According to CBS News, Thailand is ruled by a military government, and the royal family still holds a lot of power. 
Insulting the monarch, queen or heir apparent is punishable by three to 15 years in prison under Thai law. 3822985]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — The Dragonfire Laser Directed Energy Weapon is currently being developed for use on Royal Navy ships, according to a news release from the British government.

Dragonfire would have a power rating of 50 kW, according to UK Defence Journal. A spokesperson from the British military explained the technology was inspired by the Williams F1 team.

The laser uses the Flywheel Energy Storage System or FESS to store rotational energy created from the ship. The system would then use stored energy to fire the laser. It can also generate high-power electrical pulses.

According to the UK Defence Journal, the laser would be able to aim targets on land or in maritime environments. Dragonfire would also be able to provide very-short range air defence capability, and counter unmanned aerial vehicles.

The laser was tested in the United States and in the United Kingdom while using a virtual ship power system.

The laser will be installed on British ships by the mid-2020's, UK defence journal reports. 3822962]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PERTH, AUSTRALIA — Astronomers have discovered unusually rapid jets of plasma spewing from an extraordinary black hole in space.

According to research published in the journal Nature, the V404 Cygni binary system located 7,800 light years from Earth contains a black hole that feeds on a nearby star, with the material siphoned circling the hole in the form of an accretion disc.

Some of the particles that fall into the black hole escape via jets of plasma called relativistic jets that shoot from its poles.

But while most jets shoot straight out, the jets of the V404 Cygni black hole shoot out rapidly in different directions and at different times.

According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, a spinning black hole's gravitational field pulls space and time around with it — an effect called frame-dragging.

In V404 Cygni, the black hole and disc are misaligned, causing the frame-dragging effect to warp the doughnut-shaped inner ring. This in turn causes it to wobble like a spinning top and fire jets out in different directions.

Researchers from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research say that since the black hole was moving so fast, the usual radio telescopes that rely on long exposure for imaging became useless. 

Instead, the team produced 103 individual images each roughly 70 seconds long, that they then joined together into a movie. 3822922]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[RUDONG, CHINA — A man in China failed an alcohol breathalyzer test at 34 milligrams per 100 milliliters all because he had durian breath.


Durian, a fruit famous for its gym sock-esque smell, can give you a bit of dragon breath, and also get you in trouble with the po-po. That's a lesson a man in China had to learn the hard way.

According to Pear Video, our durian loving friend was pulled over by Chinese police on April 17 for a breathalyzer test, after they suspected he had had one too many drinks.

To our durian dude's surprise, he failed at 34 milligrams per 100 milliliters — the legal limit in China is about 20 milligrams per 100 milliliters.

He went down swinging though, in a video, he is seen yelling 'I've just eaten durian fruit!' Adding, 'You can take me for a blood test.'

According to Sohu News, po-po decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and administered a blood test. The results bamboozled them. The man was alcohol-free. So what was he 'drunk' on?

The answer? Durian. After the false booze alarm, police decided to test the power of the stinky fruit themselves and sure enough, just after munching on some durian, breathalyzer tests marked levels of 36 milligrams per 100 milliliters. Just three minutes later the test came out negative.

According to Pear Video, durian isn't the only food that will get you in trouble. Certain mouthwash brands and lychee fruit can also confuse a breathalyzer. 3822874]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NORTH TEXAS — Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew has passed away at the age of 74, according to a statement posted by his family on Twitter.

The beloved sci-fi star died on Tuesday evening at his home in North Texas surrounded by his family. He put his heart and soul into the role of Chewbacca and it showed in every frame of the films, the family said.

Mayhew became Chewy in 1977's Star Wars, and kept playing the walking carpet right up until 2015's The Force Awakens.  

Lucasfilm paid tribute to the British-American actor on StarWars.com, writing Standing 7 feet 3 inches tall, Mayhew's Chewbacca was an imposing sight, and through body language alone, he could convey anger, curiosity, and delight. Alongside Harrison Ford's Han Solo, one of film's most iconic duos was born.

Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, Ford described Mayhew as a kind and gentle man, possessed of great dignity and noble character. The actor said, We were partners in film and friends in life for over 30 years and I loved him. He invested his soul in the character and brought great pleasure to the Star Wars audience.

Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hammill also paid tribute to Mayhew on Twitter, saying:
He was the gentlest of giants-A big man with an even bigger heart who never failed to make me smile & a loyal friend who I loved dearly-I'm grateful for the memories we shared & I'm a better man for just having known him. Thanks Pete. 

Mayhew was also involved in various charities and non-profit organizations, including Make-a-Wish and the Wounded Warriors. 

He also created The Peter Mayhew Foundation, a non-profit organization that his family says supports everything from individuals and families in crisis situations to food and supplies for children of Venezuela during their recent road to freedom. 

Mayhew is survived by his wife Angie and three children 3822781]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[COLLEGE PARK, MARYLAND — Researchers have successfully used an unmanned drone system to deliver a donor kidney, according to a University of Maryland news release.

The drone was able to fly a kidney about 4.5 kilometers from a location in southwest Baltimore to surgical team at the medical center of the University of Maryland.

The kidney was kept in a cargo compartment which was sealed while in the air. It is called HOMAL or Human Organ Monitoring and Quality Assurance Apparatus for Long-Distance Travel.

The cargo box was able to maintain its own temperature while being able to track the altitude and GPS coordinates. This data was transmitted in real-time to the surgical team's smartphones.

This was so that the doctors could make sure the kidney was still viable, as organs tend to become less and less healthier as soon as they are removed from a donor, according to the New York Times. 

The newspaper reports the kidney was then successfully transplanted onto a 44-year-old woman named Trina Glipsy in Baltimore. 3822764]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW — Over 40 people are dead, including at least two children, after a passenger plane crash landed in a fiery blaze at a Moscow airport on Sunday.

The Moscow Times reports that the Murmansk-bound Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet had requested an emergency landing shortly after taking off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.

Russia's state-run TASS news agency cited crew members as saying this resulted from the plane being struck by lightning.

Footage of the landing shows the plane slamming into the runway at full speed, before being briefly launched up again. As it hits the runway a second time, the tail bursts into flames.

According to the Moscow Times, Russia's Investigative Committee confirmed the deaths of 41 of the 78 passengers on board. Of the 37 survivors, CNN reports that five are still in the hospital.

Aeroflot said in a statement that the aircraft was evacuated in 55 seconds, with the captain being the last to exit.

According to News.com.au, there are unconfirmed claims of passengers stopping to grab luggage from the overhead compartments, which may have delayed evacuation.

The Moscow Times reports that an investigation has been opened to look into safety violations that may have led to the deaths. 3824625]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[JERUSALEM — Palestinian and Israeli forces clashed on Sunday over a sniper who wounded two Israeli soldiers, The New York Times reports.

Violence quickly escalated, with both sides launching rockets and missiles at each other. The Israeli army says Gaza launched 600 projectiles over a period of two days.

Israel used its Iron Dome anti-missile batteries to shoot down incoming projectiles from Gaza, according to the New York Times.

Israel's military also used jets, drones, tanks and attack helicopters to evade incoming attacks from Gaza.

According to CNN, four people in Israel were killed by rockets from Gaza. As many as 23 Gazans have been reported to be killed by Israeli strikes, Haaretz reports. 

Health officials in Gaza as saying that two pregnant women, two infants and a 12-year-old boy had also been killed in the attack, CNN reports.

Officials in Gaza claim both of the infants died as a result of an Israeli air strike. Israel claims one of the infants died due to a misfired rocket.

A Palestinian official told Reuters an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire agreement had been reached between both sides to end the violence on Monday, May 6.

This is one of the worst conflicts between the two sides since 2014, according to The New York Times. 3824541]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES — Six people were busted by the feds on March 12—the same day Operation Varsity Blues captivated headlines—for allegedly helping Chinese students land US student visas by cheating on English proficiency tests. 
According to prosecutors, the suspects posed as the prospective students so they could take their TOEFL tests—an English proficiency exam— at different locations around the City of Angels. 
According to L.A. Magazine, Beijing-born and former UCLA Bruin Liu Cai was arrested by feds on suspicion of facilitating an international cheating ring. 
Prosecutors say Cai, along with four current and former UCLA students and another student at Cal State Fullerton, helped at least 40 Chinese students obtain student visas. 
The suspects would show up at the testing sites with fake Chinese passports bearing their own pictures but the names of the actual Chinese students. Cai allegedly paid three of the other test-takers $400 per exam.  
Cai almost Fast & Furioused the thing, but then he Dumb & Dumbered it by charging 39 test registration payments to his credit card, which is surprisingly how authorities tracked him down. 
The students that cheated on the TOEFL tests subsequently were accepted into universities including Columbia, NYU and UCLA.   
Officials say many of the cheating students weren't able to hack it and didn't graduate. 
Cai and his co-defendants were charged with conspiring to use false passports, using false passports and aggravated identity theft. All have pleaded not guilty. 
Yeah, why not? Maybe Cai and his friends just really like taking English proficiency exams. 3824466]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPING, CHINA — Two people are permanently dirt napping, while another 12 were injured after falling off the world's longest slide at a theme park in Sichuan last Wednesday. 
According to the SCMP, the accident occurred at the Children's Garden park in Taiping, Sichuan province.
The 14 riders made up of eight adults and six teenagers were all riding on the 235-meter-long super slide at around 5 p.m.

One witness said she saw four or five rubber inflatables with people on them all crowded together, zipping down the slide. 
All the people were screaming. Within seconds all the riders flew off the slide.
  
Apparently it had been raining all day, which made the super slide super slippery.

What's totally out of the ordinary too is that this theme park already had a real shaky safety record.
The park has been temporarily shut down by authorities to investigate the cause of the accident. 3824417]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  — The Indian space agency plans to launch the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft between July 6 to 19 as it will attempt to land on the moon on September 6.

According to a press release by the Indian Space Research Organization, the spacecraft will comprise a lander, a rover and an orbiter.

The rover will be housed within the lander.

Once Chandrayaan-2 gets within 100 km of the moon's orbit, the lander will separate from the orbiter and will attempt to land on the moon's surface.

The lander will have a soft landing at a site close to the moon's south pole, the Times of India reports.

The rover will then be able to move around semi-autonomously. It will analyze the moon's surface and send back data to earth.

However, the orbiter will continue revolving around the moon and scanning it to collect scientific information.

According to the Times of India, the country had previously launched its lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. 3824324]]></video:description>

vaccine for dengue virus 3824287]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WHITE OAK, MARYLAND — U.S. authorities have approved a controversial vaccine that prevents dengue, but it comes with important restrictions, reports Stat News. 

Dengue is a viral disease carried by female mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypti, which can also carry diseases such as chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika. According to the World Health Organization, roughly half of the world is at risk of contracting dengue, for which there is no specific treatment.

According to Stat News, last Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the distribution of Dengvaxia, a vaccine manufactured by French pharmaceutical company, Sanofi Pasteur.

The decision has sparked controversy since the vaccine was pulled from the Philippines in 2017 due to safety issues. However, the FDA has announced clear restrictions for its use in the US.

Stat News reports that it can only be used in patients ages 9 through 16 that have already had one previous dengue infection, and are living in areas of the US where the virus is endemic. The virus is only present in Puerto Rico and other offshore regions in the US.

The European Commission approved the use of Dengvaxia in dengue-endemic regions late last year. In Europe, the vaccine can only be applied to patients ages 9 to 45 who have had the disease at least once before. Dengvaxia is also available in 10 countries in Asia and Latin America. 3824287]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[U.S. accuses China of spying and stealing military tech 3824257]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — The U.S. is accusing China of stealing foreign technology to expand its military capabilities and become a world class power in the Indo-Pacific region, according to a recent report by the Pentagon.

The annual report from the Department of Defense states that China is stealing foreign military technologies through targeted foreign direct investment, cyber theft, and exploitation of private Chinese nationals' access to these technologies, as well as harnessing its intelligence services, computer intrusions, and other illicit approaches.

Washington sees this as a threat to its military dominance as Beijing could potentially degrade core U.S. operational and technological advantages.

The report warns that China continues to modernize and invest in its military expansion, stating that the PRC's defense budget has almost doubled within the past 10 years and will likely continue to grow. The Pentagon predicts China's defense budget will rise from $200 billion in 2018 to $260 billion by 2022.

According to the report, China will focus on shifting its reliance on imported technology to domestically produced technology. The U.S. believes this could pose a threat to countries that export tech products.

The report also states that projects such as the One Belt, One Road Initiative could be used as fronts to establish Chinese diplomatic and military influence overseas.

China has noticed growing suspicions from the international community regarding its Belt and Road Initiative and has since softened their rhetoric when promoting the project, according to the report.

However, China continues to influence the Western Hemisphere through soft power. In late April, U.S. officials warned members of the Council of the Americas of potential security threats after some have been opening telecommunications networks with Chinese tech companies.

Kimberly Breier, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, told the council: Citizens living in democracies in the Western Hemisphere could potentially have their entire digital identity under the control and surveillance of an authoritarian government. 3824257]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[XINJIANG, CHINA — China has been watching residents of the Muslim-majority Xinjiang province on an unprecedented scale, according to a Human Rights Watch report.

The report claims Chinese authorities are using a mobile app to track and store personal data on individuals from China's Xinjiang province.

It claims the software can store data such as a person's height, weight and even the color of their car by linking it to the their national identification number.

The New York-based group said they discovered this after they reverse engineered the Chinese software.

The Integrated Joint Operations Platform or IJOP is said to gather data about a person's movements via their smartphones and other GPS devices. 

It can collect this information from various checkpoints in Xinjiang, but also places such as gas stations and schools.

The app also labels a person as suspicious if they use Virtual Private Networks and apps such as Whatsapp and Viber — both of which are currently blocked in China.

According to the report, the app would target and monitor 36 person types. These would include individuals who rarely use their front door, use an unusual amount of electricity and those go on Hajj without state authorization.

The app can also observe and alert authorities on what it considers to be unusual activities.

It would also target those who have suddenly returned from abroad as well as those who have enthusiastically collected money and materials for a mosque. 3824189]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China planning to expand military presence in the Arctic 3825042]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  —  An annual report on China's military status from the Pentagon shows Beijing has growing interests to expand its military influence in the Arctic.

According to a report released by the U.S. Department of Defense, China's presence in the Arctic has continued to increase since it gained observer status on the Arctic Council in 2013. 

The report states that China has sent a Ukranian-built research icebreaker vessel called the Xuelong to map out the Arctic and has also proposed satellite research stations in Greenland, Iceland and Norway.

The Pentagon warned that Beijing might deploy nuclear-armed submarines as it's simultaneously growing its submarine fleet.

The report details that China currently has four nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, six nuclear-powered attack submarines, and 50 diesel powered attack submarines.

The Pentagon predicts that by 2020 the fleet could increase to up to 65 to 70 submarines. According to the report, Beijing is also planning on building a new advanced guided-missile nuclear attack submarine Type 093B that the Pentagon claims could help China carry out more covert land-attacks.

China's growing interest in the Arctic could also be due to its interest in creating a trade route in the Arctic called the 'Northern Sea Route', connecting Shanghai to Northern Europe as part of its One Belt, One Road Initiative.

Rob Huebert, a senior research fellow with the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary, strongly believes China is mapping the Arctic for military purposes, he told CBC, If you look at the overall passages where the Xuelong has gone, you can see quite clearly these are regions you would want to be sending submarines.

China's military power will continue to grow in the following years. According to the report, China's official defense budget would likely grow from $200 billion in 2018 to roughly $260 billion by 2022. 3825042]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WUHAN, CHINA — A dog spotted in a wolf enclosure at a zoo in Wuhan is apparently there for companionship. 
According to a report on Miaopai, visitors to the Jiufeng Forest Zoo spotted a dog roaming around an enclosure labeled wolf. 
At first, the zoo goers thought they were being bamboozled, but it turns out there is ONE male wolf in the enclosure. 
According to a zookeeper, the male wolf used to get in fights with other wolves, so he was put in permanent timeout. 
Problem is, the male wolf then started getting depressed from being so lonely. 
Keepers introduced two female puppies into the enclosure one day. The wolf got along with one of the puppies, so she was chosen to keep the old guy company. 
The pair have apparently been shacking up for the past two years and so far have no plans for kids, but who knows. 3825035]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HAWAII — A 32-year-old soldier searching for a better view of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano survived a 70-foot plunge into the crater. 
CBS News reports that according to parks spokesman Ben Hayes, Einstein climbed over the permanent metal railing at the Steaming Bluff overlook so he could peer into the crater. 

The problem is—he just went into the crater after the ground collapsed beneath him while he was on a 300-foot cliff.  
A Darwin Award was in his grasp until a pesky ledge around 70 feet below him stopped his rendezvous with some lava.  
According to CBS News, luckily, another person saw the man fall around 6:30 p.m. and called emergency services. 
Rescuers from the park and county were able to rappel down to the ledge and get the soldier onto a stretcher and get him out. 

He was then airlifted to the Hilo Medical Center, where he currently remains in stable condition. 
There's a railing for a reason folks. 3825032]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WEST LIBERTY, IOWA — It was a doozy of a morning for a copper and two new parents, after their baby ended up being born on the side of a highway in Iowa.

According to the West Liberty Police Department, Officer Josh Houser responded to a call about a woman in labor on Highway 6 at around 6:37 a.m. Friday.

By the time he got there, mom Ali Shellabarger had already popped the kid out in the front seat of her husband Jay's pickup.

Bodycam footage shows Houser arriving mere seconds after the baby's first breath. He sees Dad still on the phone with dispatch, and witnesses him tying the infant's umbilical cord off with string.

The little newborn is then seen in the truck, nestled snugly against mom.

Baby Iris and her maker were checked by an ambulance and later taken to the hospital. West Liberty police reports that the family is doing well.

Officer Houser, meanwhile, now wants to be called Doogie, after the genius title character played by Neil Patrick Harris in the 90s medical drama Doogie Howser, M.D. 3824973]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[VAUGHAN, CANADA  — Heads up, roller coaster thrill seekers! The longest, fastest, and tallest dive roller coaster in the world is now officially open in Ole Canada.

Unlike your grandma's boring old roller coaster, a dive coaster is what designers Bolliger & Mabillard describe as a straight vertical drop, with riders facing down. 

CNN Travel reports that Canada Wonderland's new coaster, named Yukon Striker, has a late 1800s gold rush theme. Emphasis on rush since this baby runs at 80 miles per hour on 1,105 meters of track — equivalent to the length of about 12 football fields.

The Striker features floorless seating, so riders can see absolutely everything as they're turned upside down on no less than four inversions.

The pièce de résistance, though, is the 'hold and dive' on the 90-degree drop. For 3 seconds, riders are dangled over 245 feet of abyss before being plunged into an underwater tunnel, then back up a 360-degree loop.

Yeah, this coaster is intense, and at least for those who can handle it — not to be missed. But if you're too chicken, there's always the merry-go-round. 3824964]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SPACE — Precious elements such as gold, uranium, and platinum are found in our solar system due to a clash that took place between two neutron stars 4.6 billion years ago, according to a new study published in the journal Nature.

When two neutron stars clash together, powerful gravitational waves are formed, creating enough energy for these heavy metals to be forged.

Scientists tested out this theory by analyzing the isotopic decay of ancient meteorites that had fallen to Earth. This was then compared to a numerical simulation of our solar system.

The researchers believe that the collision occurred around 100 million years before Earth was formed.

This celestial phenomenon is said to have enriched our planet with up to 0.3 percent of its heaviest elements present today, according to a University of Florida news release.

Imre Bartos, a researcher involved with the study, said he believes that the study could provide an insight into the origin and composition of our solar system. 3824820]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — A Chinese vlogger had to rock solid idea to film herself attempting to eat a live octopus, until the octopus threw its arms up in protest—all eight of them.  

Apparently, Einstein shares videos over Chinese video sharing platform Kuaishou and regularly posts clips of herself jamming seafood down her pie hole. 
In the clip on Kuaishou, the hilarious scene starts out with the octopus just hanging out on the woman's face.  

But then when she tries to remove it, old Octopussy decides to stick around a bit longer. 
She can be heard saying, look how hard it's sucking. 

As she continues to lose the tug of war, she tells the camera it's painful and that she can't remove it.

Unfortunately, the woman finally manages to get the octopus off her grill. She then tells her viewers that she'll eat the octopus in her next video. 
We'll all keep our fingers crossed and hope the octopus makes it even harder for next time. Good luck little buddy. 3825703]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LAND O' LAKES, FLORIDA — A man and wife had quite the shopping trip at a Publix supermarket in Florida after the hubby caught one in the leg from a gun in the purse of his better half.
According to the Tampa Bay Times, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office initially reported that the victim accidentally capped himself around 2 p.m. on Sunday. 
Publix was then kind enough to set the record straight by providing video of the incident. 
Apparently, 69-year-old Vernon Messier was in line checking out at the cash register when his wife Lillian's purse fell from the counter to the ground. 
Vernon is then seen on candid camera flinching and falling over. 
According to the Sheriff's Office, a hole was found in Lillian's purse afterward. Turns out the 67-year-old was packing a two-shot Derringer pistol in her bag that popped a round off. 

Looks like Vernon took one for the team in the lower right shin and was transported to the hospital in stable condition. 

Turns out Lillian had a concealed carry permit. Maybe she should have told her husband.

      <video:description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA — Luke Perry's daughter Sophie recently revealed on Instagram that her late father chose an alternative form of internment, in the form of a biodegradable a mushroom suit.

According to the BBC, human bodies contain toxic pollutants such as lead and mercury that are released into the environment during decomposition and cremation.

The mushroom suit, or infinity burial suit, developed by Jae Rhim Lee of green burial company Coeio claims to neutralize these pollutants.

The suit, made of organic cotton, contains biomix made from mushrooms and other microorganisms that aids decomposition, cleans toxins in the body and soil, and delivers nutrients to plants.

According to the Coeio website, mushrooms break down material by emitting enzymes, and are able to eliminate both organic toxins and heavy metals in the environment through a process called mycoremediation.

Coeio's suit requires no special preparations. The body is simply dressed in it, and then buried at an optimal depth of 4 feet, with or without a casket.

The mushroom suit costs $1,500, which the company says is far less than traditional burial options that can run up to $6,000. Coeio also has a version of the suit for pets. 3825491]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[STANFORD, CALIFORNIA — There is a region of the brain that tends to retain animated characters such as Pokemon rather than other visual information, according to a study published in the journal Nature.

The researchers conducted their study on a group of adults who had extensive experience playing with Pokemon on Gameboy devices as kids.

The eleven adults were considered experienced as they had began playing Pokemon between the ages of five and eight and were able to name all 150 characters.

According to a Stanford University press release, the participants went through an MRI scanner and were shown images of Pokemon characters while the researchers observed how their brains responded.

Researchers found that the participants' visual cortex, located at the bottom of the temporal lobe, was stimulated by looking at the different animated characters, according to a Penn Today news release.

The images stimulated the same areas of the brain in all study participants.

Michael Barnett, a researcher involved with the study, explained that the brain is capable of developing a specialized area for recognizing stimuli such as Pokemon due to continued exposure to the animated characters. 3825410]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION — A bioreactor that runs on algae has been sent to the International Space Station to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and to generate food, according to a press release by the German Aerospace Center.

The Photobioreactor contains an algae species called Chlorella vulgaris[i][j], which uses photosynthesis to produce oxygen.

The press release says the freshwater algae could create an edible biomass that would be high in protein content. It could one day replace around 30 percent of an astronaut's current meals.

The reactor also create fresh air for the space station for around six months and will be supported by the Advanced Closed-Loop System, or ACLS.

Thebioreactor could one day help support astronauts on long missions in base stations on the Moon or on planets such as Mars, according to the German Aerospace Center. 

It would make it possible for less food and equipment to be carried onto future space missions. 3826291]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — China is up to its old tricks again by backtracking on almost all aspects of the trade deal with the U.S.

According to Reuters, a diplomatic cable that arrived in Washington late on Friday night had systematic edits to a nearly 150-page draft trade agreement, basically blowing up months on laborious negotiations between the two countries. 
According to three U.S. government sources and three private sector sources briefed on the negotiations talking to Reuters said, the document was stuffed with reversals by China that undermined core U.S. demands. 
In each chapter of the draft trade deal, China removed its commitments to change laws to resolve core complaints that caused the U.S. to start the trade war: theft of U.S. IP and trade secrets; forced technology transfers; competition policy; access to financial services; and currency manipulation. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a press conference on Wednesday that this was a process of negotiation and that China was not avoiding problems. 
According to China, they say they can't touch the laws. One Chinese official said changing any law in China requires a unique set of processes that can't be navigated quickly. 
Really? Changing a law in an authoritarian country is basically easier than blinking. 
Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent on Friday. 3826280]]></video:description>

According the NBC Sports Chicago, the 14 NBA teams that did not qualify for the postseason make up the eligible Lottery pool. 

A thousand possible Lottery combinations are divided among those 14 teams based on regular season records.  
This is how the drawing works. There are 14 ping pong balls numbered 1 to 14. Those balls are dropped into a glass drum and mixed for 20 seconds. 

At that point, four balls are drawn for the first pick in 10-second intervals. 

This process will then be repeated to select picks two, three and four. 
According to NBC Sports Chicago, the remaining 10 draft picks are then slotted to the remaining 10 teams in reverse standing order. 3826257]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — The EPA continues to back the use of glyphosate in Roundup, even after it has been identified as a carcinogenic.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved the use of glyphosate in the herbicide Roundup.

Their endorsement comes despite findings by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer that claim glyphosate is probably carcinogenic to humans.

According to the National Pesticide Information Center, glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide first introduced in 1974 by Monsanto. Glyphosate blocks protein production of an enzyme in certain plants, preventing them from growing.

According to National Geographic, Roundup is the second most widely used herbicide in the US. It can be used in farms, gardens, and weeds in urban areas.

Humans can be exposed to glyphosate if herbicides come in contact with their skin and eyes or by breathing it in during spraying.

Monsanto has recently lost two cases against cancer patients that claim exposure to glyphosate present in Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

However, the company continues to state that the chemical is safe to use, saying in a statement, Bayer firmly believes that the science supports the safety of glyphosate-based herbicides, which are some of the most thoroughly studied products of their kind, and is pleased that the regulators tasked with assessing this extensive body of science continue to reach favorable conclusions. 3826007]]></video:description>

A 60-year-old man from Gujarat, India named Parvat Gala Baria found himself between a snake and a hard place after a sneaky reptile interrupted him at work.

According to Hindustan Times, Baria was loading maize onto a truck with other men in an open field when the slithery python approached the group, looking for a fight.

Most men noped out of the situation but Brave Baria allegedly told others that he had caught snakes before and got ready to K.O. the serpent.

Baria then seized the wild animal but the viper promptly bit him on the hand and face. He let go but not before biting back at the snake and killing it.

Baria was transported to a medical facility because of the bite, but unfortunately didn't make it. Rest in peace snake warrior. You put Bear Grylls to shame.

      <video:description><![CDATA[KENT, WASHINGTON — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' private aerospace company Blue Origin unveiled its new moon lander called the Blue Moon on Thursday May 9, The Guardian reports.

The unmanned vehicle would be capable of carrying upto 6.5 metric tons of payload onto the surface of the moon.

According to Blue Origin's website, the lander has been in development for years. It would carry supplies needed to lay out the infrastructure for future space missions. According to Blue origin, Blue Moon would use descent sensors in order to land.

The lander would use fuel cells for longer missions and also to last through the night on the moon. The spacecraft's fuel cells are capable of using only hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity.

According to CNet, Bezos said a larger version of the lander would be able to take Americans to the moon by 2024. 3826855]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[YOUR DIRTY POCKETS — When do you use your AirPods? At work? During your sweaty workout session? Do you put them inside your lint and dirt-filled pockets? Has it ever occurred to you to clean them? You should.

Turns out, AirPods and in-ear style earphones can get pretty nasty. Last year, Business Insider swabbed 22 pairs of earbuds to find out what kind of gunk we are inserting in our ears every day.

Results showed that two of them had grown yeast and one was hosting a dirt-bacteria. Imagine how much they would have found if they had swabbed more samples? Ugh.

On top of harboring bacteria, in-ear headphones also increase wax build-up. According to Allina Health, our ears are self-cleaning but in-ear headphones can push down wax into the ear canal and prevent wax from naturally coming out as well as cause infection and hearing loss.

So what can you do to keep your ears protected? Well, the answer is pretty obvious. Stop blasting the volume and just clean 'em.  Business Insider suggests using dry toothbrushes and cotton swabs dipped in rubbing alcohol to disinfect and brush out the ear wax and bacteria.

You should also make it a point to clean the AirPod charging case, which can get just as nasty as the earphones themselves. Business Insider also used cotton swabs, a toothbrush, and a microfiber cloth to wipe the case which can also host all types of germs.

How often should you be cleaning your wax-filled earphones, you might ask?  It truly just depends on how much buildup you can take. Just don't share those icky suckers with others. It's disgusting enough to have your own gunk stuck in your ear canal, let alone share your bacteria-buddies with others. 3826852]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TORONTO — Google's Sidewalk Labs is facing controversy over its plans to build a high-tech neighborhood in Canada.

Sidewalk Labs won a bid in 2017 to turn a 12-acre patch of industrial landscape in Quayside, Toronto into a smart neighborhood, BBC News reports.

The company is collaborating with Waterfront Toronto to transform the neighborhood's waterfront area into a mini metropolis.

According to Sidewalk Labs' website, the neighborhood would consist of a next-generation transit system that would include buses and rails to improve street safety. The area will include housing and real estate that would have flexible designs that enable multi-purpose usage.

It would also include sustainable design and infrastructure to reduce landfill waste and carbon emissions.

The futuristic neighborhood would use open digital infrastructure that would collect data on traffic, noise and air quality, according to the BBC. This has raised questions about what exactly the data is being gathered for.

The company told the BBC that the sensors wouldn't be used for monitoring purposes and would instead allow governments to be flexible on how they want the sensors to be used in the neighborhood.

According to the BBC, privacy advocates are concerned the project will increase surveillance and outsource government responsibilities to a private corporation.

Privacy advocates and digital rights activists in Toronto urged the government to stop the redevelopment of the area due to privacy concerns and a lack of transparency from the U.S. based company, reported The Star.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has now filed a lawsuit against Waterfront Toronto, the municipal, provincial and federal governments, BBC News reports. 3826847]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPEI — A Huawei Mediapad M5 was found to be sending data from several apps back to China by a Canadian IT engineer living in Taiwan. 
Talking to Taiwan News, the man said he bought Huawei device about six months ago and installed a firewall program to identify apps running in the background in order to disable them to save battery life. 
The engineer soon found several applications were running in the background and sending data back to servers in China without ever having asked his permission. 
The man said the apps continued to run in the background even after being disabled. He said the apps are sending information such as browsing data and login details like usernames and passwords. 
He told Taiwan News that most of the pre-installed Huawei software was sending data to Shanghai Dnion Information Technology Co. Ltd, in Beijing. 
He said that data often goes through a cloud server Huawei uses in Singapore to scoot around the Great Firewall of China. 
A list of 23 different apps were found to run no matter what he did or how many times he turned them off. 

Apparently, when he turns on his 4G in Taiwan, all the Huawei apps, including camera, gallery and files send out data queries, with some apparently bypassing Singapore and going straight to the Chinese IP addresses. 
In addition to Huawei servers, some apps on his phone were also trying to send data to Google and Facebook. 3828159]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NORWICH, NEW YORK — A school bus driver is being hailed a hero after her life-saving grab prevented a student from getting hit by a car.

The Norwich City School District posted a video of the April 26 incident on their Facebook page, both to praise driver Samantha Call and as a way to spread awareness on school bus safety.

The video begins with the bus slowly coming to a stop, and 13-year-old Matthew Squires standing in the aisle, preparing to get off.

Call told WBNG she checked the bottom mirror before letting him out, like she does for every kid, and spotted a car about to pass the side of the bus as Squires was on the third step down.

Thinking fast, she yanked him back just before a silver car is seen whizzing past outside, saving the boy's life. Call is then seen honking the horn on the bad driver, before letting Squires go.

The boy's mom says she cried when she saw the footage and witnessed how close her son came to being pummeled by a car, and is grateful to Call for her quick action.

WSYR-TV reports that despite the multiple cameras on Call's bus, the driver in this case can't be caught. In New York State, you can be ticketed for passing a bus only if an officer sees it first hand.

Lawmakers are currently pushing for a new bill School Bus Camera Safety Act. If it passes, the state can use bus videos to hold irresponsible drivers like this one accountable. 3828145]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CURACAO — A case of measles has left 28 people quarantined aboard a Scientology-owned ship in the Caribbean island of Curacao.

According to the Associated Press, health officials announced Saturday that 17 crew members and 11 passengers had to stay onboard until May 13, since they were still at risk of contracting the disease.

Dr. Izzy Gerstenbluth, an epidemiologist with the Public Health of Curacao, said the rest of the 318 people can't become sick anymore and are no longer a threat, so are free to leave.

The 440-foot Freewinds cruise ship was previously quarantined in St. Lucia after a female crew member was diagnosed with measles. 

The woman had been in Europe, and arrived in Curacao on April 17 exhibiting cold symptoms.

She got tested for measles, but was already on the ship en route to St. Lucia by the time the results came back positive.

After the Freewinds returned to its home port of Curacao a week ago, authorities took 277 blood samples from those without proof of vaccination, and sent them to the Netherlands.

In a statement, the Church of Scientology said Curacao authorities acknowledged the ship for its strict isolation protocol, which prevented the disease from spreading, effectively containing it to a single case.

Measles symptoms include runny nose, fever, and a red-spotted rash. While people recover, it can lead to brain swelling, pneumonia, and in some cases, death.

Though preventable with vaccines, the U.S. has seen a resurgence of measles cases, which federal officials say is due to misinformation about vaccines. This year alone, over 700 people in 22 states have gotten the disease. 3828076]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — A report by the Wall Street Journal gives details of a missile developed by U.S. intelligence designed to attack targets while reducing civilian casualties.

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. Department of Defense have developed a missile called Hellfire R9X, designed to carry out precision strikes while minimizing collateral damage.

The Hellfire R9X missile carries a payload of over 100 pounds of metal and six blades that spread before impact instead of an explosive warhead.

Other Hellfire models carry explosives and can injure or kill any individual within its blast radius.

The Journal reports that the Hellfire R9X has been used roughly six times in different attacks in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Somalia.

The R9X was also used on Feb 26, 2017, where it targeted and killed al-Qaeda deputy leader Abu Al-Khayr al-Masri during an attack in Syria. Photographs show the roof of al-Masri's car with a hole in its roof and a broken windshield but no severe collateral damage in the surrounding area. 3828015]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK —  CBS's 'The Good Wife' spinoff show, 'The Good Fight', had to cut out a 90-second song called 'Banned in China' where they made fun of crazy Chinese censorship policies, according to The New Yorker. 

The Good Fight is a legal drama show airs on CBS's All Access streaming channel covering conundrums in American politics and society under the Trump administration.

The show is known to be heavily satirical, and every now and then episodes will cut to a musical cartoon where they sing about anything from Russian troll farms to Melania Trump.

This time, however, the show decided to pull back and show a black screen with the words 'CBS HAS CENSORED THIS CONTENT' instead of a song because China.

According to The New Yorker, the song that had to be censored was called 'Banned in China' and for good reason.

Jonathan Coulton, the singer behind all the controversial tunes, told The New Yorker about all the references the song made at Chinese censorship, and boy does it seem like they went all in.

For the bridge of the song, Coulton said that there were references to Winnie-the-Pooh — President Xi's doppelganger— , an empty chair in honor of late Chinese Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, Tiananmen square, Chinese re-education camp — the list goes on.

At one point Coulton says a part of the animation shows Xi dressed as Winnie-the-Pooh shaking his money maker.

So what was the point of the video? Well, although Chinese censorship requirements are lengthy and ridiculous, American corporations cannot ignore a market as big as China's, so they all end up kowtowing.

In a statement, CBS All Access clarified why the short was cut out saying, quote, 'We had concerns with some subject matter in the episode's animated short. This is the creative solution that we agreed upon with the producers.' end quote. 
We guess this is PR talk for We didn't want our show to get canceled in China 'cause money.

Their fear is real though, their show, The Good Wife, was banned from China after an episode featured a Chinese dissident character being tortured. The Good Fight hasn't been banned. Yet.

Coulton told the New York Times, The song ends with me saying, 'I hope this song is banned in China.' Now it'll never get the chance.. We are just as disappointed as you are, Coulton. 3828009]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BAYAN-ULGII, MONGOLIA — A couple in Mongolia contracted the deadly plague after consuming some raw rodent meat, The Guardian reports.

The bubonic plague is usually spread from animals to humans by fleas, BBC News reports.

The couple had apparently eaten raw marmot meat and were thought to have developed the pneumonic plague from that.

According to NPR, the plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis which lives in infected animals, such as rodents.

Mongolian authorities have warned residents against consuming raw marmot meat because it carries this bacterium, The Guardian reports.

The plague causes bleeding and infected sores on a person. If left untreated, it can kill a person in a number of days.

The disease can turn septicemic or pneumonic once the bacteria has spread to the lungs. The pneumonic plague can spread from person to person via droplets in the air.

Symptoms of bubonic plague include fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, vomiting and joint pain, while symptoms of pneumonic plague include fever, headaches, cough, chest pain and muscle weakness. 

If diagnosed early, the disease can be treated with antibiotics such as streptomycin and tetracycline, according to the World Health Organization.

The Mongolian government declared a quarantine for six days in the region starting on May 1 to prevent the spread of the deadly plague, BBC News reports. 3827944]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI — A motorcyclist is on the highway to heaven after taking a plunge from an elevated highway.
According to CGTN, dashcam footage from another car on the overpass shows the rider speeding down the Wenshui Overpass on Tuesday afternoon. 
As the highway begins to curve to the right, Not-So-Evil-Knievel can be seen drifting to the left toward the barrier. 
Ghost rider then collides with the wall and goes over the side. Unfortunately after that, he really became one with the road. 
Police and emergency responders showed up at the scene quickly after. An investigation is underway into the accident. 
According to CGTN, similar motorcycle mishaps have occurred along this section of highway in 2007 and 2010.  
It's illegal to ride motorcycles on all elevated highways in Shanghai. 3827863]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — China is considered by those throughout the known universe to be at the very cutting edge of video gaming—by this, we mean they CUT all the fun out of video games. 
The latest casualty according to Reuters is PUBG Mobile, which was unable to gain approval from the pinheads in the Chinese government to monetize the game. 

According to Reuters, Tencent shut down its test version of PUBG Mobile on Wednesday. 

PUBG Mobile is the smartphone version of the hit battle royale game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. 
According to Reuters, the game is being replaced by a Beijing-approved tactical shooter called Game for Peace.
In a post on Tencent's website, the company marketed the game as paying tribute to the blue sky warriors that guard our country's airspace. 
According to some comments over Weibo, the new pro-China game is also way less gory than PUBG Mobile. 
According to a Reddit post, when you kill another player in the game, they wave back at you. 
Aside from that massive change, Chinese players claim Game for Peace is pretty much a poor man's PUBG Mobile.   
China's fun-loving government dropped some ridiculous mobile game rules in April. 

According to Engadget, three types of games are now in virtual concentration camps: Mahjong and poker, games based on China's imperial past, and games that have bodies or blood—of any color.

The new not-anal-at-all regulations also require developers to give up information about a given title including detailed scripts and screenshots. Sounds fabulous. 3827860]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Shrinking moon could be causing powerful quakes 3828844]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MOON — Newly-published research has found evidence that the moon is shrinking and may still be tectonically active.

In a new study published in Nature Geoscience, researchers analyzed data from seismometers placed on the moon during the Apollo missions. They found 28 recorded moonquakes between 1969 to 1977 that ranged from magnitude two to five on the Richter scale.

According to NASA, the moon shrinks as its interior cools, forming geological formations called thrust faults when sections of the brittle crust are forced up over neighboring parts.

Eight of the 28 epicenters were found to be within 30 kilometers of these faults.

Analysis also found that six of the quakes happened when the moon was at apogee. This is the farthest point from the Earth in its orbit, and the period when our planet's gravity inflicts additional stress.

Scientists believe it's likely that the stress build up as the lunar crust is compressed by global contraction and tidal forces, causes the faults to slip and produce the quakes. 

Other evidence of recent tectonic activity on the moon include tracks on the lunar surface from landslides or dislodged boulders that have not yet been erased by micrometeoroid activity. 3828844]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SACRAMENTO — A passenger stuck waiting for hours on a Southwest Airlines flight from Sacramento to Austin, Texas was actually booted from the plane for making joke a flight attendant didn't find funny.
According to Fox 40, Flight 478 to Austin from Sacramento with a stop in L.A. was scheduled to fly on May 8. 
According to passenger Peter Uzelac talking to Fox 40, while the airplane was on the taxiway, a maintenance light came on, so the plane was forced to head back to the gate. 
Uzelac said the flight was then delayed again. 
After a few hours passed—with all the passengers stuck onboard—they needed to refuel. At this time the flight attendants started handing out water. 
That's when the passenger next to Uzelac made a joke about passing out vodka because they'd been waiting so long. 
The flight attendant apparently lacks all form of funny bone because she then walked over and said, I don't think that and I didn't like your joke. 
She then had the gall to get on the phone and report the guy, which caused the plane to return back to the gate yet again, but this time so several Sacramento County sheriff's deputies could get on board to remove the guy.
The sheriff's office says the man was not charged with any crime, but he did miss his flight—and all because of a joke. 3828722]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[FUSHAN, CHINA — A young crane operator in China went full Superman-mode by rescuing a whole bunch of people from a burning building on May 2. 

According to Pear Video, 19-year-old Lan Junze was at work at a construction site in Fushan, Liaoning province when he noticed an apartment building on fire close by. 

The fire apparently started on the first floor of the building from a grocery store and quickly began spreading. 
Viral video footage shows Lan hop into action using the crane to get residents out from the upper floors of the seven-story building. 
Maneuvering around power lines and a ton of smoke, Lan was able to rescue 14 people in only 30 minutes. 
He told Sohu News that, at the time, I only wanted to save people. I didn't think of anything else. I didn't have the time.

Lan has been praised online and recognized by several organizations for his heroic deeds. Lan credits his parents for raising him well. 3828720]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GUIZHOU, CHINA — A poor kid in China was left chasing after mom and dad after they missed the Disney memo about ohana and no one getting left behind.

According to the South China Morning Post, the six year old and his parents had stopped for a bathroom break at a service station near Zunyi in China's Guizhou province.

But once they were done, the world's best parents apparently up and left without their precious cargo.

CCTV footage posted online shows the family car driving out of the rest stop, and a little boy running out onto the highway after it. 

Luckily, the kid was picked up by a motorist and dropped off at a toll station, where officials reported the case to the cops.

Police officer Zhang Yun told Guizhou Television that he was on his way to pick the boy up when he got a report about a couple who lost their kid. Took them long enough.

The boy and his forgetful parents were eventually reunited at the police station, after officers verified the couple's identity.

Here's hoping they don't make a habit of losing their kid. 3828588]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING / COLOMBO — Beijing is providing a US$1.4 billion loan to Sri Lanka for their Port City Colombo project, The South China Morning Post reports.

This project aims to develop a metropolis from land reclaimed from the sea. According to The South China Morning Post, the Chinese loan would be the largest foreign investment in Sri Lankan history. The project is said to be part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, whereby China invests large amounts of money into a country in order to develop its infrastructure.

According to the China Daily, a total of 269 hectares of land reclamation was completed in January. The basic infrastructure for the project is expected to be completed in 15 months.

Plans for the city include skyscrapers, hospitals, hotels and theme parks. The port city would be turned into a major financial hub that may one day rival Singapore and Dubai, according to Chinese state media. Chinese authorities claim the project would create 83,000 jobs and attract upto US$13 billion worth of investments to develop the city.

Beijing has already lent Colombo over US$8 billion dollars to fund other ambitious projects such as airports, ports, railways and more, The South China Morning Post reports. In December 2017, Sri Lanka had to hand over the Hambantota Port and 15,000 acres of land surrounding the area to China for 99 years as the country was unable to pay back a loan.

Smruti Pattanaik, from the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, was quoted by the South Morning China Post as saying that, The lure of belt and road money is hard to resist for developing nations as it provides something they are [badly] in need of — funding for infrastructure.  Adding that the Chinese funding comes at a cost. 3828576]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TOKYO — Japan will begin testing the world's fastest Shinkansen bullet-train which is capable of reaching speeds of up to 400 kilometers per hour.

According to Bloomberg, Japanese rail company JR East will begin testing its fastest bullet train called Alfa-X this Friday between the cities of Aomori and Sendai over the next three years.

Alfa-X stands for 'Advanced Labs for Frontline Activity in rail eXperimentation.' It has ten passenger cars and an elongated nose at the front measuring 22 meters.

The train will operate three types of brakes: standard brakes, airbrakes on its roof and magnetic plates at the rails.

Dampers and air suspension systems will help the train stabilize on curves. JR East plans on letting the Alpha-X run at 360 kilometers per hour, that is 10 kilometers per hour faster than China's Fuxing Hao train which is capable of reaching the same top speeds.

The Alfa-X is scheduled to go into service in 2030. 3828554]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA['MURICA — Lily Fogels has always been obsessed with space and was shocked to find that her local Target store only sold NASA t-shirts for boys.

Lily said she doubled checked the girls' section for space-themed clothing, however the NASA t-shirts were nowhere to be found.

She decided to buy a t-shirt from the boys' section anyway but she was determined to let Target know her thoughts on this.

Metro reports the little girl wrote a letter to Target saying, I am very upset right now because all your NASA clothing is only in the boys area in my Target and I am a girl.

Lily continued adding that, I want NASA clothes in the girls area because girls like space too. It doesn't need to be different styles just move some from the boys.

Target has yet to respond to Lily's letter. According to Metro, Lily said that it is unfair that the store didn't sell any NASA clothing for girls.

Lily's mom, Suzi Fogels, said that the fact that Target failed to keep a supply of female NASA t-shirts shows that there is still the stereotype that space is only for boys, adding that boys are more encouraged than girls to aim to become an astronaut or to work in the space industry.

She said she encouraged her daughter to write the letter in hopes of bringing about change. 3828545]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[New research shows cats are just as smart as doggos 3828497]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CORVALLIS, OREGON — New research is proving cats are as socially aware as dogs, according to ScienceMag.

Humans in the world are divided into two kinds, dog and cat people. Dog people claim puppers are more loyal, affectionate and smart — I mean have you ever heard of a police cat? While cat people like how independent felines can be. 
But are cats really that different from dogs? Some scientists don't think so.

According to ScienceMag, researchers began testing cognition among our furry friends roughly 20 years ago by using a test that's used to gauge social cognition in toddlers.

If you point at an object in a room, toddlers will automatically look in that direction. This shows they understand that the adult is trying to communicate with them. 

This was thought to be a very human process until 20 years ago when experiments showed that dogs also reacted to humans pointing at objects. Not even our chimpanzee cousins responded to the experiment.

Cats are not social animals like dogs or chimpanzees, so it was assumed they wouldn't be able to recognize this human gesture, or would they?

Kristyn Vitale, a postdoctorate student at Oregon State University, is studying feline cognition and has witnessed cats successfully pass this test.

Cats aren't just responding to pointing either. Vitale has also placed loud fans inside empty rooms with the cats and their owners. The felines automatically seek shelter behind their owner and begin to respond positively to the fan if they see their owner speaking to the object in a reassuring way.

Cats have always been left behind when it comes to animal research due to their solitary nature but this new research shows that our feline friends could be more aware of humans than we give them credit for.

If you want to test how 'human-friendly' your cat is, ScienceMag suggests you try the experiments at home. Check if your cat reacts to where you point at or if they look to you for reassurance when in presence of a foreign object. For now, dogs still hold the title of 'man's best friend'. 3828497]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Google goes real politically correct with 53 genderless emojis 3828419]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[GOOGLEVERSE — Emoji rights activists are celebrating the world over as Google releases 53 gender slippery emojis.

According to Fast Company, the update is an effort to make the symbols more inclusive. 
Android emoji director Jennifer told Fast Company, we're not calling this the non-binary character, the third gender, or an asexual emoji—and not gender neutral. Gender neutral is what you call pants.
Google introduced the 53 updated emojis as part of a beta release for Pixel smartphones last week. 
According to Fast Company, they have been designed to fit in the space between female and male emojis and recognize gender as a spectrum.   

Google's design team went through several drafts to develop people who will leave your head scratching as to their sex.    

The gender defying new vampire now has a chain, instead of a privileged white male bowtie or necklace. 
And now instead of a mermaid or merman—Google gives us the merperson. 

Merpeople have been excluded for far too long in modern day society. It's nice to see a tech company that will finally take a stand for those who lack the voice.      

Fast Company also points out that since Google collaborates with Apple and other tech companies when it comes to emojis, you can most likely expect to see the fluid emojis on other platforms soon as well. 3828419]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI — Chinese surgeons are using deep brain stimulation or DBS to treat methamphetamine addiction in its first ever clinical trial, according to the Associated Press.

The technique involves a device being surgically implanted onto the brain. This would
stimulate targeted areas of the brain in an attempt to stop drug addiction.

The surgeon drilled two holes through the patient's skull and placed two electrodes at the nucleus accumbens. This part of the brain is believed to be connected with addiction.

Next, the man had a battery pack implanted on his chest to power the brain device. After two days, the doctor switched on the DBS devices to activate the electrodes.

According to the Associated Press, there are risks to the surgery. These include  seizures, infection or potential death via a brain hemorrhage.

Critics believe that human experiments like this are at a premature stage and don't address biological, social and psychological factors that cause a person to become addicted in the first place.

There is also concern around issues regarding participants' informed consent in places such as China, The Associated Press reports.

Speaking to the Associated Press, investigators from similar U.S. based studies explained their attempts at trials for treating alcoholism were stopped. This was because study design and preliminary results didn't justify the risk. 3828299]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW TAIPEI CITY, TAIWAN — A man in Taiwan succumbed to the lure of a claw machine and not only wasted his family's money, but got busted for attempting to steal it back. Talk about bad decisions.

According to Apple Daily, 44-year-old Mr. Cheng blew his son's NT$5,000 or $161 school tuition on a claw game in New Taipei City's Banqiao District.

Father of the year then decided to try and recoup his losses by trying to steal it back.

With help from his 22-year-old coworker Kuo, dear old Dad robbed a coin changer at a newer arcade, which hadn't yet installed surveillance cameras.

Kuo used a power grinder to break the locks on the machine, and managed to get over NT$10,000 in NT$10 coins.

Unfortunately for them, someone reported their shady activities to the cops, who arrived to find the damaged padlocks on the machine, and the not-so-smooth criminals still on the scene counting their loot.

The pair confessed to their crimes after being taken in for questioning, even admitting they were nervous about doing the heist in broad daylight.

Kuo had repeatedly assured Cheng that they would be done in 10 minutes, which they were. Only the cops were just as fast, and also made it there in 10 minutes.

The two were arrested for larceny, and have been transferred to the New Taipei City Prosecutor's Office. 3829482]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA — An oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia was targeted by drones amid heightened tensions in the gulf.

According to Gulf News, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said that explosive-laden drones attacked two oil pumping stations for the East-West oil pipeline.

The Associated Press reports that the two stations are located in al-Duadmi and Afif, several hundred kilometers west of Riyadh.

Government-controlled oil company Saudi Aramco temporarily shut down the pipeline as a precaution, and contained a fire that caused minor damage to one pumping station. Oil and gas supplies were not affected.

According to AP, Saudi Arabia is currently at war with the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who claimed to have launched seven drones targeting vital Saudi installations. The Houthis later claimed responsibility for the pipeline attack.

Saudi Arabia's 1200-kilometer East-West pipeline was built in the 1980s and has a total capacity of 4.8 million barrels of oil a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

It serves as an alternative channel for crude exports should the vital Strait of Hormuz be closed - something Iran has repeatedly threatened to do.

The Tuesday attack occurred mere days after four oil tankers were damaged off the coast of the UAE port of Fujairah in what the Saudis describe as sabotage.

Details of the alleged sabotage to the tankers - two of which are Saudi, one Norwegian, and one Emirati - remain unclear. 3829193]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NORTH CAROLINA / SOUTH CAROLINA — Three massive great white sharks have been pinged by ocean trackers near the Carolinas, Newsweek reports.

Researchers from OCEARCH, a non-profit group that tracks shark activity in the sea, shared their findings on a Facebook post.

The largest of the sharks, named Luna, is 15 feet long and weighs a total of 2,137 pounds. The second shark, named Caroline, is 12 feet, 9 inches in length and was spotted close to Edisto Beach near South Carolina. The third, called Katherine, was seen near the coast of Charleston, South Carolina.

The sharks were swimming across the Charleston Bump, which is around 80 to 100 miles from South Carolina, The Charlotte Observer reports.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that area is a deep water bank in which many deep-sea sharks are traditionally found.

Citing OCEARCH, the Charlotte Observer reports sharks are feeding on fish pulled north by the Gulf Stream into waters near the Carolinas. 3829009]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Ex-Google boss Eric Schmidt defends Google controversies 3828992]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — Former Google exec, Eric Schmidt, defended several controversies involving tech giant Google during an interview with the BBC, including secretly developing a search engine for China, sexism in the workplace, and moving their money to tax havens. Here's what he had to say.

Let's start with Google's involvement with China. Right after stating that, quote, transparency is a virtue during the interview, Schmidt was questioned on why the company had decided to keep Dragonfly, a code name for a censored search engine Google was developing for China, undercover — even from the employees that were unknowingly developing it.

His answer? Certainly the people who were building all these products knew about it. Truth is, certainly not. According to reports by The Intercept, only hundreds out of 88,000 Google employees knew about Dragonfly and those who later found out weren't too happy. 

What's more, employees learned about the project through news reports. According to The Intercept, thousands of Googlers responded by signing an open letter where they condemned Dragonfly and asked the company to abandon it. Doesn't really sound like there was a lot of transparency going on there, huh?

Schmidt didn't leave it at that though. He also said he disagreed with Google's decision to leave China in 2010, saying,  I believed they would be better to stay in China, and help change China to be more open. Right, help China be more open. Might we add Google left China at the time due to safety concerns and threats of cyber attacks?  

But Google's shady China dealings isn't the only thing that has its workers up in arms. Employees took to the streets in November to protest for gender equality in the company, after the New York Times reported that former exec Andy Rubin got an exit package of $90 million despite a credible claim of sexual harassment against him.

Schmidt did not address the sexual harassment claim, but chalked down employee protests as showing our culture at work, adding that Google is empowering of its employees and wants to hear from them. Guess as long as what they hear aren't sexual harassment claims?

There's more. According to the BBC, Google moved $22.7 billion to a shell company in Bermuda, a well-known tax haven. Schmidt dismissed the issue, explaining they were adhering to global tax regimes and added, Would you like us to give more, voluntarily, to these governments?

When questioned further on whether or not Dragonfly should continue to be developed, Schmidt stated he would not comment as he was no longer involved with management in the company. 

Schmidt was a Google executive chairman from 2011 to 2015 and is currently on the board of directors of Google's parent company, Alphabet. He is set to leave the board in June but will remain as a technical advisor. 3828992]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — AI SpaceFactory has won first place in NASA's 3D printed Habitat Challenge for its Mars habitat prototype, according to a  press release by the company.

The 3D-printed structures were tested and evaluated on the mix of material used, leakage, durability and strength, according to a NASA news release.

The pod-shaped habitat is called Marsha and was 3D-printed over the course of 30 hours. According to the company, the habitat would be made from materials such as biopolymer basalt composite, which can be extracted from Mars. 

This process would be enabled by In-situ resource utilization or ISRU, which would harvest the Red Planet's surface to collect the resources needed. The robotic 3D printers would then use the materials to print the Martian habitats.

AI SpaceFactory explained on its website that Marsha utilizes a dual-shell system that would isolate the habitat from extreme weather temperature shifts on Mars.

It would also include strategically placed windows that would allow natural light to enter the habitat while keeping out harmful solar and cosmic radiation. 3829523]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Bering Sea ice receding 
alarmingly: report 3830536]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BERING SEA — The Bering Sea's ice is vanishing, endangering surrounding indigenous communities, sealife and fisheries, reports ScienceMag. 

The late winter sea ice of the Bering Sea is falling to some of the lowest levels in the past 40 years. The report states that around March every year, sea ice usually stretches out from the south of the Bering Sea and reaches the areas surrounding the Aleutian Islands. But in 2018 it only stretched as far as Alaska. 

The rapid ice loss could be due to changes in wind direction and water temperature. One of the explanations offered by ScienceMag is that climate change is altering the polar jet stream, bringing warmer winds to the Bering Sea and causing the ice to recede.   

Oceanographer Seth Danielson told ScienceMag the ice loss could also be a result of rising temperatures in the Bering Sea. Data gathered in early 2018 shows the sea was 2 degrees Celsius warmer than usual. This increase in temperature delays ice formation by three weeks. 

The ice formation and high temperatures could have also been affected by low ice coverage in 2017, which might have allowed the sea ice to absorb more heat.

The lack of sea ice in 2018 also affected local ecosystems and animal life. Populations of zooplankton, algae, fish, and seabirds have already been affected. These shifts in temperature could also affect American fisheries located in the southeastern Bering Sea. If the sea ice continues to recede, fish factories in the north could be too far from fishing grounds, making it more expensive to haul fish. 3830536]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Humans in space: Jeff Bezos unveils space colony vision 3830531]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Jeff Bezos, the richest man on Earth, has a vision for the future of humanity that is out of this world. Literally.

Last week, Blue Origin unveiled the design of its first lunar lander called, Blue Moon. At the same time Bezos announced his grand vision for human-kind: to create floating colonies outside of Earth. Here is what he has in mind. 

According to a press conference, Jeff Bezos envisions human colonies in outer space capable of holding up to 1 trillion people in rotating cylinders called O'Neill Cylinders.

The O'Neill Cylinder was developed by Princeton physicist Gerard K. O'Neill in 1974. According to data from the National Space Society, the design is made up of two 20-mile-long cylinders, both measuring 4 miles in diameter.

The cylinders contain 3 land areas that cover a total of 500 square miles. They rotate in opposite directions, keeping the colonies aimed towards the sun.

Bezos stated that the colonies would have high-speed transportation, farming land, urban areas, and recreational areas with zero gravity.

He added that some areas of the colonies could be replicas of famous cities on Earth. 

The weather in these cylinders would be adjusted for optimal human comfort. According to Bezos, there would be no earthquakes and no rain.

He claims that these cylindrical colonies are a better bet for sustaining human life outside of Earth as opposed to Martian or Lunar colonies due to how far and how small they are to Earth in comparison.  

In order to cut costs, Bezos proposes transporting humans to and from the colonies in reusable spacecraft such as Blue Origin's New Shephard, a suborbital space vehicle powered using liquid nitrogen designed for space tourism.

The whole idea sounds pretty far fetched. Bezos admits that this will not be a reality for this or the next generation, but he vowed to begin working on the infrastructure, saying quote, If this generation builds the road to space, build that infrastructure, we will get to see thousands of future entrepreneurs building a real space industry. 3830531]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Scientists can detect Alzheimer's disease up to 30 years in advance 3830303]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BALTIMORE — Researchers have identified a range of biomarkers that could determine if an individual develops Alzheimer's disease years in advance, according to a study published in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.

In a John Hopkins university press release, Laurent Younes, a researcher involved with the study, said that brain imaging and spinal fluid analysis could be used to examine the risk of Alzheimer's at least 10 years before symptoms appear.

Scientists tested their studies on 290 participants over the age of 40. Those who were part of the study had at least one first degree relative with a form of Alzheimer's.

Participants of the study were asked to conduct memory, learning, reading and attention tests annually from 1995 to 2013.

The researchers found an increase of the tau protein present in the cerebrospinal fluid around 30 years before any symptoms of Alzheimer's appeared. Proteins such as amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau also started to appear around 10 to 15 years before the indications of Alzheimers began to manifest.

Scientists also found a slight decrease in the size of the medial temporal lobe in the brain, three to nine years before any cognitive impairment was noticeable. This part of the brain is responsible for memory. 

By the end of the study, 81 participants had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. 

The researchers plan to conduct further studies in five different research sites around the world to compare data, according to the study. 3830303]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Is dark matter blasting holes in the Milky Way? 3830288]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MILKY WAY — Something strange is blasting holes in the Milky Way, but we're not really sure what.

Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics researcher Ana Bonaca presented findings at the American Physical Society conference of a series of holes in GD-1, our galaxy's longest stellar stream.

According to Physics, stellar streams like GD-1 are remnants of star clusters or dwarf galaxies that have been ensnared by our galaxy, and stretched out while being drawn into its orbit.

Under normal conditions, the stream is a single line. But a high-resolution map of GD-1 created from Gaia observatory data revealed gaps in the stream, along with a spur — a thorn-like structure that had not been seen before.

Bonaca and her colleagues believe something large plunged through the stream, but couldn't map it to any of the luminous objects they observed.

They suspect the culprit to be a clump of dark matter, but need more evidence to support the theory, or to rule out other possibilities.

The team wants to conduct more mapping work to uncover other areas where the unseen object has come a-knocking, with the eventual goal being to map dark matter clumps all across our galaxy. 3830288]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — Chinese state-run media People's Daily just released a video showing off how strong and mighty their soldiers are.

In the video, exhausted PLA soldiers are seen frantically jumping and trying to swim in muddy puddles.

The People's Daily tweeted out the video with a caption saying This is the incredibly strong soldier morale of China's PLA. They fear nothing.

The immediate release of the video quickly attracted the attention and mockery of commentators on Twitter.

One snappy commentator said, Wow so brave, he jumped in a puddle. Another said ,''Congrats China! Your 'soldiers' can handle water.

Former U.S. Army men also reacted to the video by sharing images of the so-called strong morale of the U.S. Marine Corps.

But apparently all this ridicule isn't getting to the PLA soldiers because they fear nothing. 3830104]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[JERUSALEM — WhatsApp strongly urged all its users to upgrade to the latest version of the messaging app following reports that vulnerabilities could leave their phones open to spyware. 
According to the Financial Times, hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices using a major flaw in the app. 
The Financial Times reported that the attack was developed by Israeli security firm NSO Group. 

According to the Financial Times report, hackers were able to use WhatsApp's voice calling function to ring a target's device. Even if the call was not answered, the spyware could be installed, and the call would often disappear from the device's call log. 
According to the BBC, WhatsApp's security team was the first to identify the flaw, and shared the information with human rights groups, certain security vendors and the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month. 

The report said the malware was designed by Israeli cyber surveillance company NSO Group and affects both Android and iPhones. 
WhatsApp wasn't able to provide numbers as to how many phones were targeted. 
When asked about the report, NSO said its technology is licensed to authorized government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror, and that it doesn't operate the system itself. 3830098]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Trees in China are growing quicker because of climate change 3830094]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA —Larch trees in northeastern China were found to have grown faster in the past 40 years as a result of climate change, according to a study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.

Researchers looked at the trees' growth rings and found that trees older than 400 years have grown faster from 2005 to 2014 than in the previous 300 years. Trees between 250 and 300 years old grew around 35 percent more during the same period. 

The authors of the study explained that they believe that warmer soil temperatures may be causing the trees to grow rapidly. This is because roots start to expand and absorb more nutrients as the depth of the permafrost layer is lowered.

A press release from Advancing Earth and Space Science, cites Xianliang Zhang, lead author of the study as saying that growth in old trees is unusual. Adding that it could be as a result of well-developed root systems present in the older trees that are able to absorb nutrients from the soil more efficiently.

The researchers added that this may be good in the short term basis, but would be disastrous for forests in the long run. This is because permafrost underneath trees could degrade or no longer support trees as the climate becomes warmer. 3830094]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MARIANA TRENCH — An American undersea explorer found plastic garbage littering the ocean floor while breaking the record for deepest ever manned sea dive. 
According to CNN, Victor Vescovo dove 10,927 meters—or 35,853 feet—to the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the southern end of the Mariana Trench, as part of a mission to chart the deepest depths of the planet. 
According to BBC, Vescovo and his team made five dives to the bottom of the trench during the expedition. 

They discovered amazing sea creatures, but sadly also found a plastic bag and candy wrappers. 
BBC reports that other expeditions using landers have also found plastic pollution lurking in the murky depths. 
The researchers now plan to test some of the creatures they collected at the bottom of the trench to see if they contain microplastics. 3830090]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPEI — Love won in Taiwan as legislators approved same-sex marriage in a historic first for Asia.

BBC reports that in 2017, the island nation's Constitutional Court ruled that homosexuals had the right to legally marry.

The government was given two years to enact legislation, either by amending the current laws or passing new ones.

Taiwanese lawmakers debated three different draft bills on same-sex marriage. On Friday, just a week before the May 24 deadline, they passed the most progressive one by 66 to 27 votes.

CNN reports that the winning bill, backed by lawmakers from the Democratic Progressive Party and LGBTQ groups, was the only one to use the word marriage.

It's the only one to offer some adoption rights to homosexual couples, allowing them to adopt a partner's biological child.

The bill was a definite win for marriage equality, sparking widespread celebration both in Taiwan and among LGBTQ folks in the region.

Just a day later, the country held its first joint wedding ceremony for gay and straight couples in Taipei, according to CNA.

But despite this very clear win for gender equality, the bill doesn't grant full marriage rights,so the fight is still on for adoption rights and transnational marriages. 3831881]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM — The second anniversary of the Manchester terror incident will be marked by a private memorial service on May 22 for survivors, first responders, and families who lost loved ones.

Here's what happened on that dark day two years ago.

The New York Times reports that Ariana Grande concert goers were leaving Manchester Arena on the night of May 22, 2017 when a blast rocked the venue.

According to the publication, Islamic extremist Salman Abedi had stood in the foyer carrying a homemade TATP bomb inside a backpack. Evidence found at the scene shows the device was powered by a 12-volt, 2.1 amp lead acid battery, and packed with metal bolts and screws.

The BBC reports that Abedi detonated the incendiary device at 10:31 p.m., killing himself and 22 people, and injuring over a hundred others.

According to the Guardian, mobile phone footage recorded panic inside the auditorium immediately after the explosion, as people ran to the exits to try and get out.

Salman Abedi had been born and raised in Manchester to Libyan refugee parents. He has three siblings, all born in England.

According to the BBC, 22-year-old Abedi is believed to have been taught bomb making while in Libya. He then returned to the U.K. days before the attack to construct his device.

A report by parliamentary watchdog ISC criticized MI5 and counter terrorism police for missing chances to prevent the bombing.

Abedi had been flagged for review as a subject of interest but wasn't under active investigation. The lack of monitoring or travel restrictions reportedly allowed him to return to Britain undetected.

According to the BBC, Abedi's brother Hashem, is wanted in relation to the bombing. He was taken into custody in Tripoli in 2017 and was meant to be extradited to the U.K, but fighting in Libya has continued to delay the process. 3831868]]></video:description>

system will 'restore trust' 3831642]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — In a report released on Monday in the Global Times, China claims to be working on data protection and privacy leak concerns surrounding their infamous 'social credit system'.

According to the report, the amount of personal identity data they process is just quote, beyond the understanding of Western countries. 

A report from China's National Development and Reform Commission published in the Global Times states that authorities are developing security regulations over privacy leak concerns. 

The Commission is behind China's social credit system, a reputation system that categorizes citizens based on their behavior. The Chinese government claims the system will help the country restore social trust.

In a press release, Chinese authorities announced new regulations for behavior in public transportation that could affect people's social credit. They state that eating on trains, playing loud music, illegally purchasing tickets and even occupying more than one seat can cost citizen's points. 

According to the Global Times, as of March, a total of 13.49 million people have been categorized as untrustworthy. These people have been denied access to 20.47 million plane tickets and 5.71 million high-speed train tickets. 

China's strict policies have even reached public toilets. According to a report by the South China Morning Post, in April 2018, China rolled out high-tech toilets with facial recognition to hand out limited amounts of toilet paper in the cities of Chongqing and Changsha. 

The toilets hand-out 40 centimeters of toilet paper after scanning an individual's face. The bathrooms are equipped with WiFi, mobile charging ports and sensors inside each cubicle that alerts authorities if a person has been inside the toilet for more than 10 minutes. 

This technology was called for by President Xi Jinping to improve the facilities and to prevent people from stealing toilet paper; this is being called the 'toilet revolution' in Chinese media. 3831642]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Pollution sapping Asian summer monsoon 3831632]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[XIAN, CHINA — The Asian summer monsoon typically brings about a lot of rainfall, but scientists have found that the rate of precipitation has actually been declining over the past eight decades, according to a study published in Geophysical Research Letters.

According to National Geographic, the summer monsoon usually takes place between the months of April to September.

New research from the journal Geophysical Research Letters says that rainfall during the Asian summer monsoon has been found to be decreasing in strength over the past 80 years.

Human-made atmospheric pollutants such as sulfate aerosol emissions could be contributing to the reduction, according to a University of Arizona news release.

Using climate models, scientists found that as the amount of pollutants in the atmosphere increases, the rate of monsoon rain tends to decline.

The researchers also looked at tree-ring data from north China over the past 450 years to determine precipitation rates over the decades. This is because trees tend to grow thicker rings during wetter years.

Factors such as solar variability and volcanic eruptions are also believed to impact the strength of the Asian summer monsoon.

As rainfall from the summer monsoon has been declining, this has had an impact on water availability, ecosystems and agriculture across the globe. 3831632]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[RUNIT DOME, MARSHALL ISLANDS — UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has raised concerns over a concrete dome in the Marshall Islands leaking radioactive waste into the Pacific Ocean.

The nuclear dome was built in the late 1970s during the Cold War era. The dome was originally built to contain radioactive waste from nuclear tests conducted by the U.S., CBS News reports.

According to CBS News, the U.S. conducted 64 nuclear weapons tests at Bikini and Enewetak atolls in the Marshall Islands from 1946 to 1958.

The tests included the Bravo hydrogen bomb, which was said to be a 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima, reports Al Jazeera. 

Radioactive ash and soil from nuclear explosions were put into the crater, which was closed with an 18-inch-thick concrete dome. This was originally meant to be a temporary solution with the bottom of the crater never being lined.

Decades of exposure has caused cracks to develop on the surface of the concrete, raising concerns that the radioactive waste present in the dome could slowly be making its way into the Pacific Ocean, CBS News reports. 

Guterres, who was speaking to students in Fiji during a press event as part of his South Pacific tour, was quoted by CBS News as saying, The consequences of these [issues] have been quite dramatic, in relation to health, in relation to the poisoning of waters in some areas.

Guterres is currently touring the South Pacific to raise awareness on issues related to climate change. 3831483]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Trump ban on foreign telecom gear targets Huawei 3831466]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Trump administration made a move to enable a ban on Huawei gear, amid an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. 

According to the New York Times, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to ban U.S. telecom firms from using foreign-made equipment from sources that may pose a risk to national security.

While no nation or company was singled out in the ban, the Commerce Department later added Huawei and its affiliates on a list of firms considered to be undermining American interests.

The listing prevents Huawei from purchasing U.S. parts or technologies without the government's approval.

According to CNN, U.S. officials have openly warned against using gear from Huawei and other Chinese companies, arguing that these tech products could allow China to spy on U.S. communications.

Major mobile phone companies in America are largely unaffected as they don't use Huawei equipment, but the order may be costly for rural wireless carriers who do use Huawei as a cheaper alternative to European brands like Nokia or Ericsson.

CNN reports that the executive order would apply to past purchases of telecom gear, though officials didn't say whether the government would help smaller carriers pay to remove or switch out their foreign gear.

No word either on what the punishment would be for those who don't comply. 3831466]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[POWELL, OHIO — Several middle school students are definitely in need of some extra credit after allegedly putting a bit of their own extra sauces into food that was served to teachers. 
A spokesperson for the Delaware County Sheriff's office said there are several victims and suspects. 
According to WBNS, the incident allegedly happened last Thursday at Hyatts Middle School in a Global Gourmet class. 

The sheriff's office said the students are accused of adding their own lemonade and milkshakes into crepes served to teachers. 
Apparently there was video—of course there was—of the culprits adding the self-made Country Time and spooge into crepes, circulating among the students. 
Staff unfortunately didn't learn of the video until five to six hours after the teachers had eaten the food. 
According to the Sheriff's Office, lab tests are underway to CSI the substances.     
The school district released a statement saying, the safety and security of our students and staff is of utmost importance. District leadership and local law enforcement are conducting a thorough investigation into this incident, and anyone found in violation of school policies will be held accountable for their actions. 3832369]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[KANE'OHE BAY, U.S. — New research shows coral reefs located in Kane'ohe Bay, Hawaii are capable of growing in acidic and warm waters. 

Human activity has contributed to the destruction of coral reefs via overfishing, pollution and coral bleaching.  From 1930 to 1970, reefs located in Kane'ohe Bay, Hawaii were subject to dredging, coastal development and sewage dumping. All of this destroyed 95 percent of reefs.  

In 1978, sewage outposts were removed from the area.Two decades later, the reef surface had recovered to between 50 and 95 percent. 

According to a recent study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, the reefs were able to thrive despite the acidification of the water. 

The team gathered branches of three main coral species from about 10 to 12 colonies in Waimanalo and Kane'ohe Bay. They exposed them to warm or acidic water in a controlled environment for five weeks.     

The results showed that corals extracted from Kane'ohe Bay had a higher tolerance to warm and acidic water which allowed them to blossom more than twice as fast as the corals from Waimanalo Bay.   

Christopher Jury, the lead scientist from the study, believes that because the reefs in Kane'ohe Bay have the properties to flourish in polluted environments they make the area, quote, incredibly valuable as a possible window into the future. 3832281]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[DOVER, NEW JERSEY — A couple of Dover, New Jersey police officers are in some pretty hot water after video surfaced online showing them violently arresting a teenager.

The Morristown Daily Record reports that the cops tried to arrest 19-year-old Cyprian Luke outside a convenience store early Sunday. 

He had been wanted on charges of assault, violating court orders, and criminal mischief, but Luke's brother Christopher told WABC the cops never mentioned a warrant — they just tackled and pepper sprayed him.

The po-po claims he was resisting arrest, but video recorded at the scene and posted on Facebook shows Luke pinned to the ground on his back and being punched in the face.

While one officer has a hand around the teen's throat, the rest orders him to roll onto his stomach. How he was supposed to do that with another cop's knee pressed to his stomach, we're not exactly sure. 

In one clip, Luke's face is bloodied and injured as at least half a dozen cops can be seen pressing the kid to the ground and putting him in handcuffs.

Another clip shows the monsters in blue hoisting him up and dragging him down the street into what looks to be an ambulance. At that point, the poor dude was shoeless, with pants hanging below his waist.

The damning video spread on social media and got people riled up and crying foul. NBC reports that on over 50 people protested outside the Dover Police Department Sunday night, demanding justice.

The Morris County Prosecutor's Office says it's investigating the incident, and has already put three of the officers involved on administrative leave. 3832264]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WAIMEA, HAWAII — Scientists at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii have recorded the highest levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide ever in human history.

Increases in carbon dioxide concentration have caused rises in temperature during ice age cycles over the past million years or more, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

According to data from the observatory, CO2 concentration levels were recorded to be over 415 parts per million, or ppm.

The last time carbon dioxide concentration levels were this high was more than 3 million years ago, according to the NOAA.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently increasing at a rate of 3 parts per million every year.

According to a report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global temperatures have already risen by approximately 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels due to human activity.

Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist who writes for climate change and social justice site Grist, tweeted his response to the report, saying: This is the first time in human history our planet's atmosphere has had more than 415 ppm CO2.

Not just in recorded history, not just since the invention of agriculture 10,000 years ago. Since before modern humans existed millions of years ago.

He added: We don't know a planet like this. 3832184]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BERMUDA ISLAND — The now-dormant volcano that created the island of Bermuda formed in a way that has not been observed before, according to a study published in the journal Nature.

Scientists examined the chemical composition of a core sample drilled from the volcano in 1972 and found that it contained large amounts of water enclosed in crystals.

This indicates that the core consists of material from the earth's mantle transition zone, which is 250 to 400 miles beneath the planet's crust.

The scientists developed numerical models and found that a disturbance in the transition zone most likely caused the materials to melt and permeate to earth's surface. The water found in the crystals most likely aided the rocks in melting while in the transition zone, according to the researchers.

Previously, volcanoes were known to form when tectonic plates converge or drift apart, or when mantle plumes rise from the core-mantle boundary.

The researchers had been expecting to find that Bermuda was formed a mantle plume, as was Hawaii.

Senior author of the study Esteban Gazel, was quoted in a Cornell University news release as saying: With this work we can demonstrate that the Earth's transition zone is an extreme chemical reservoir.

Our next step is to examine more locations to determine the difference between geological processes that can result in intraplate volcanoes and determine the role of the mantle's transition zone in the evolution of our planet. 3832143]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Billionaire pledges to pay off new graduates' student loans 3832136]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[ATLANTA  —  A billionaire has promised to set up a grant to pay off the student debt of nearly 400 students from the Morehouse College graduating class of 2019. 

Robert F. Smith — a billionaire investor estimated to be worth $5 billion by Forbes — was this year's commencement speaker. His gift to the graduating class? A grant to pay off their student loans. That's 396 young graduates.  

In the live Facebook video shared by Morehouse College, you can hear students erupting into celebration and professors behind Smith go wide-eyed after he announced the surprise in the last few minutes of his speech. 

Before breaking the news to the class, Smith told the students, we're gonna put a little fuel in your bus. That little fuel will go a long way for many. 

According to the Associated Press, finance major, Aaron Mitchom was going to graduate with a $200,000 student loan. Smith's grant will allow him to step out of college debt-free. He told the AP, I was shocked. My heart dropped. We all cried. In the moment it was like a burden had been taken off.

Student loan debt in America is on the rise. According to a report by the Institute for College Access and Success, in 1996 college seniors in four-year programs had an average debt of $12,750. That number has increased to $28,650 as of 2017.

Smith's donation is all the more impactful because Morehouse is a predominantly African-American college. 

According to a report by the Brookings Institution, African-American college graduate students owe $7,400 more than white students. Their debt grows to almost $53,000 four years after graduation. That's double the amount of white students.

This isn't Smith's first contribution to Morehouse. In January, he donated $1.5 million to fund scholarships and created an outdoor study area for` the students. Imagine if the rest of the 1 percent did stuff like this regularly? 3832136]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[KUNMING, CHINA — A waitress at a restaurant in China had the unfortunate experience of having a hot pot blow up in her face while she tried fishing out a lighter a customer had dropped in the soup by accident. 

According to Miaopai, surveillance footage from a Haidilao hot pot chain restaurant on May 15 in Kunming shows the waitress looking for the lost lighter. 
Apparently one of the guys at the table dropped it into the bubbling broth. 
Footage then shows the waitress using two hot pot ladles to search for the lighter. 
Unfortunately, things suddenly get a little too hot to handle as the hot pot explodes right into her face, sending the two male diners running from the table. 
Two people were reportedly injured and transported to the hospital.  

According to the Shanghaiist, the Haidilao chain was founded in 1994 in Sichuan province and has since opened up more than 190 locations around the world. 3833039]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Chinese-made drones might be sending sensitive flight data back to manufacturers in China, where the curious eyes of the CCP have all access. 
According to CNN, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued an alert on Monday saying drones are a potential risk to an organization's information. 
DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency stated that products contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.
The report doesn't point the finger at any particular manufacturers, but almost 80 percent of drones used in the U.S. and Canada are made by DJI, headquartered in Shenzhen, China. 
According to CNN, U.S. local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators are increasingly relying on these drones. 
The alert says, the United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access.
Users are warned to be careful when purchasing China-made drones, and to take precautionary steps like turning off the device's internet connection and removing secure digital cards. 
So maybe think twice before dropping some serious coin on your next drone. 3833036]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PLUTO — New research provides evidence of an ocean buried in Pluto that's kept from freezing by an insulating layer.

According to CNN, observations made by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in 2015 on  Pluto's ellipsoidal basin Sputnik Planitia have led scientists to believe an ocean exists beneath the planet's icy surface.

Pluto is roughly 4.6 billion years old and isn't in the vicinity of a gas giant that could heat it using tidal forces. Its ocean should have frozen millions of years ago, but evidence suggests it has not.

A new study published in Nature Geoscience suggests an insulating layer of gas hydrates, which are ice-like solids that form when gas bubbles — in this case methane — are trapped between frozen water molecules.

Computer simulations conducted by the researchers show the ocean hardly freezes with a gas hydrate layer present. Without the hydrate layer, however, the subsurface ocean would have frozen completely hundreds of millions of years ago.

The theory might also explain the unique composition of Pluto's atmosphere, which is rich in nitrogen but poor in methane.

Researchers say that if gas hydrate insulating layers could indeed keep subsurface oceans from freezing, there may be more oceans in the universe than previously thought. 3832998]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BANGKOK — An air passenger from China pissed off a plane full of people after forcing them to wait for shopaholic daughter.

According to Beijing News, the dastardly duo were meant to be on a 3:30 a.m. Spring Airlines flight from Bangkok to Shanghai on May 15, along with about 160 other passengers.

Mommy dearest had arrived at the boarding gate and tried to stall the flight for her daughter, who was still duty free shopping at the airport.

Footage taken at the scene shows an airline worker talking to the woman, who is seen sitting on the jet bridge just outside the aircraft — probably to prevent crew from shutting the plane door.

Spring Air told the Daily Mail that the unreasonable passenger claimed her darling daughter called airport police to demand that the plane wait for her.

Needless to say, the passengers already inside the plane were furious, and can be seen in a clip complaining to the cabin crew, who tried their best to calm them down.

Little Miss Shopaholic and mom gave up their trip in the end, but by then the four-hour Spring Air flight had already been delayed for 30 minutes. It arrived in Shanghai past 9 a.m., more than an hour behind schedule.

The story trended on Chinese social media, with netizens calling for the badly behaving pair to be blacklisted by the Chinese National Tourism Administration, which has punished tourists for anything from chucking boiling water at a flight attendant to throwing a coin in the plane engine for luck. 3832993]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[EARTH — A comprehensive new global review has found that air pollution may be harming nearly every cell in the human body.

According to a review published in Chest Journal, the harmful effects of toxic air begin when it is inhaled.

Once in the lungs, it can cause breathing problems, including asthma and emphysema. It can also cause serious harm to the heart, with narrowing arteries and weakening muscles resulting in an increased risk of heart attacks.

Small pollution particles penetrate the lungs and are mistaken as bacteria by immune cells, which then release enzymes and acids to try and kill them.

These proteins spread around the body, causing systemic inflammation. The damage is far-reaching, affecting the brain, kidneys, and pancreas.

Brain conditions associated with pollution include stroke, dementia, and reduced intelligence. There's evidence to suggest poor sleep may also be a consequence of breathing in bad air.

The Guardian reports that research highlighted in the review links air pollution to various cancers, including in the bladder and gut.

Toxic air likewise affects bones and skin, and has been associated with brittle bones, skin ageing, and hives.

According to the review, exposure to polluted air can lead to reduced fertility and increased miscarriages.

It poses a risk for unborn babies, with a recent study finding pollutants in fetal placentas.
Air pollution is also linked to low birth weights for babies, and can lead to stunted development in children.

Prof. Dean Schraufnagel, who led the reviews, is worried that doctors may be unaware of how much damage is associated with air pollution, and suggests they should pay attention, and then speak up and educate their patients. 3832866]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[VANCOUVER, CANADA — Huawei's Chief Financial Officer is currently under house arrest in her six bedroom mansion worth millions of dollars, according to Reuters.

Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Canada since December 2018 for her role in allegedly misleading banks to evade US sanctions against Iran, CNN reports.  

Since then Meng has requested a judge on the Canadian Supreme Court to move into another one of her properties, on Matthews Street residence.

The mansion is around 8,170 square feet and contains seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms, according to Reuters.

This new mansion would be fully fenced and allows controlled access for pedestrians and vehicles entering the house.

According to Reuters, Meng is allowed to move around Vancouver relatively freely. But, as reported by CNN, she is required to wear a GPS ankle bracelet. 3832836]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Google restricts Huawei's use of Android 3832831]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA — Google has made the right move by barring Huawei from some updates to the Android operating system. 
According to the BBC, new models of some Huawei spy phones are set to lose access to some Google apps. 
The BBC reports the move comes after the Trump administration smartly added Huawei to a list of Chinese companies that American firms can't trade with unless they obtain a license. 
Google said in a statement, it was complying with the order and reviewing the implications.
According to BBC, old Huawei spy phone users will be able to update apps and push through security fixes, in addition to update Google Play services.

Hopefully when Google launches the next version of Android later this year, it won't be available on Huawei devices. 
The BBC reported, future Huawei junk may no longer have apps such as YouTube and Maps. 
Huawei can still use the version of the Android operating system available through an open source license. 
According to the BBC, several countries are worried Huawei devices could be used by China for spying. 
The BBC also reported that Huawei has denied the allegations and said its work does not pose any threats.

They also said they are independent from the Chinese government.

Unfortunately, the only thing Huawei seems to be independent from is reality. 3832831]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PENDER, NEBRASKA — A farmer in Nebraska had to amputate his own leg after it got trapped in farming equipment, ABC News reports.

Kurt Kaser told ABC News he was working all by himself on his farm, shifting grain into a bin using a mobile grain auger when suddenly the unthinkable happened.

Kaser explained that he had previously removed part of the safety screen covering the auger's hopper but he forgot that while shifting the grain.

As soon as Kaser stepped onto the machine, it grabbed him and started twisting his leg.

The Nebraskan farmer said the equipment started tearing away the skin, tissue and even muscle from his leg to the point where he was able to see his bone.

Kaser remembered he had a pocket knife with a 3 to 4 inch blade. He then used the knife to sever his leg eight inches below the knee.

The 63 year-old told ABC News he then got on his hands and knees and dragged himself across rock and gravel to his shed where he immediately contacted one of his sons.

They dialled 911 and soon a medical helicopter arrived onsite and swiftly took him to a trauma center 90 miles away.

This, however, isn't the first time Kaser has had his leg stuck in an auger. He told ABC News his right leg was injured by the machine just a few years ago. 

Kaser spent three weeks undergoing rehabilitation at a hospital. According to WCSC-TV, he now hopes to get a prosthetic leg and get back to farming. 3832829]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[5G Technology: Explained 3832778]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[THE MATRIX —   The hype for 5G wireless technology is real, what with it being able to support virtual reality simulations and download feature-length videos in seconds — but what is 5G exactly and what are we willing to risk for better internet connection?

5G is the generation of wireless technology that follows 4G LTE mobile connections. According to Raconteur, it operates on higher radio frequencies called millimeter waves which allows it to deliver data more quickly.

However, its signal doesn't travel well through physical objects such as buildings and houses and its waves can be absorbed by rain and humidity. 

Millimeter waves also have limited range. According to Lifewire, 5G signals cover less than one square mile from the cell tower, only allowing devices in close proximity to link to the network. 

This will require the construction of several 5G cell towers in order for devices to stay connected.

According to The Verge, Verizon launched its 5G network in early May in Chicago and Minneapolis. The technology is hard to come by but in areas near 5G towers, download speeds can reach between 400 and 600 Mbps. 

Users are thrilled, health experts on the other hand are concerned.   

In January, a  group of 250 researchers and scientists from around the world signed a petition addressing the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the UN Environment Program asking them to further investigate the impact of 5G technology on humans.

They fear radiofrequency radiation from devices including cell towers, smartphones, WiFi signals, TV antennas might have adverse effects on human health.

They listed increased cancer risk, genetic damage, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits and neurological disorders as possible side effects to being exposed to radiation.

They recommend creating stronger regulations and guidelines for 5G networks, protecting children and pregnant women and creating radiation-free areas. 

5G could also reduce the accuracy of weather forecasts. According to a new study published in the journal Nature, 5G networks transmit at nearly the same frequency as weather satellites and could produce a signal similar to water vapor. 

This could throw off predictions and reduce accuracy by 30 percent, according to NOAA Acting Chief, Neil Jacobs. 3832778]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China attempted to hack German software company 3832737]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[GOPPINGEN, GERMANY — German software company Team Viewer has confirmed a previously undisclosed breach by Chinese state-owned hackers that occurred in 2016. 

Der Spiegel reports that the hackers used a malware called Winnti. This trojan computer virus has been present since 2009 and is known to be used by several hacker groups in China, making it hard to pinpoint who was behind the 2016 breach. 

However, ZDNet states that two Beijing hacking groups called APT 10 and APT 17 have carried out attacks similar to the Team Viewer breach. 

The company told Der Spiegel they detected the break-in before any damage had been done and added that no customer data or private information had been stolen. Der Spiegel, however, claims the Chinese hackers had infiltrated TeamViewer's system since 2014.  

Team Viewer is a closed-source software used for desktop sharing, online meetings and conferences, and remote control access. Their software is used by millions, making them a target for hacker groups. Their clients include large corporations, such as Microsoft, Philips, and Lush.    

Other German companies have also been targeted in the past. According to Bleeping Computer, leading German steel producer ThyssenKrupp was attacked by Southeast Asian hackers in 2016. The company believes the hackers' goal was to extract technical information and research done by ThyssenKrupp. 

According to Reuters, German pharma giant Bayer also claimed to have detected and contained a data infiltration they believe was orchestrated by Chinese hackers, who used the Winnti malware to breach their system. 3832737]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SPACE — A massive asteroid with its own mini moon will be blazing a trail close to Earth this weekend.

According to NASA, Asteroid 1999 KW4 is a binary system composed of a nearly mile-wide main body shaped like a walnut or spinning top, orbited by a smaller rock that is a third of a mile across.

Each orbit takes 17 and a half hours, according to the Las Cumbres Observatory.

NASA reports that the asteroid has been doing flybys several times each century since the 1600s, and will be making another close approach to Earth on May 25.

Although classified as 'potentially hazardous' by the Minor Planet Center, the asteroid will be passing near Earth at a safe distance of more than three million miles, or over 13.5 lunar distances.

CNET reports that Asteroid 1999 KW4 will be moving fast at 48,123 miles per hour when it flies by, which may make it easier for amateur observers to see.

According to NASA, double asteroid's next approach will be closer, but won't be until 2036. 3833582]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[How the U.S. ban will affect Huawei technology 3833507]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  —  Last Monday, news broke that Trump had banned Chinese tech giant, Huawei, from the U.S. market after trade negotiations went stale and Google has only temporarily lifted its Android ban against Huawei.  How will this affect the company?

On Sunday, according to Tech Radar, Google announced it would be pulling the company's license to use Android, however, the U.S. Commerce Department temporarily lifted the ban on Tuesday. 

These two moves leave Huawei in a difficult situation, to say the least. Here is how this could affect the company.

Chinese tech company, Huawei, was blacklisted by the U.S. government last Monday. The tech company — as do most tech corporations — depends heavily on foreign components. 

Huawei's P30 Pro motherboard is an example of this. According to BBC, only two components from the motherboard are Chinese, its RF transceivers and audio chip. Both are made by HiSilicon, which is owned by Huawei.

Two of the chip's front end modules which connect the phone to network signals and allows it to manage different radio frequencies are made in two separate American semiconductor firms. One is located in Massachusetts and the other in Greensboro, North Carolina. Both will be affected by the ban. 

The device's flash storage located at the back of the motherboard is made by a semiconductor company from Idaho called Micron Technologies. Benchmark analysts estimate that 13 percent of the company's revenue comes from Huawei.  

The P30 Pro's dynamic random access memory or DRAM is also foreign. This piece of equipment is from South Korean component company, SK Hynix.  

This is the breakdown of a piece of a single device. Imagine how many foreign components are needed for Huawei's laptops, tablets, home devices, and accessories?

Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei is defiant. Global News reports that during an interview with Chinese state media, CCTV, he said quote, The U.S. government's actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities. 

If you got a Huawei, continue using at your own discretion. Or get any one of the thousands of other phones out there. 3833507]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CAPE CANAVERAL AIR FORCE STATION, FLORIDA — SpaceX is set to launch 60 Starlink satellites that would provide broadband internet services and orbit around Earth, according to Space.com.

The satellites will be launched on Thursday via the Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral in Florida.

The launch was initially planned for May 15. It was, however, delayed due to high winds, according to CNet.

This is the early stages of SpaceX's plans to launch an affordable high-speed broadband network into space. Starlink would be able to provide internet access to those who are yet-to-be connected online, according to SpaceX's website.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was cited by Space.com as saying that the Starlink network would require around 400 satellites to provide minor internet coverage around the world, while 800 would be needed for moderate internet coverage.

According to CNet, this will be the beginning of SpaceX's plans to launch a megaconstellation with as many as 12,000 satellites orbiting Earth's atmosphere.

Previously, the FCC had given SpaceX permission for its satellites to orbit at a lower altitude from 1,150 kilometers to 550 kilometers.

By operating satellites at a lower orbit, according to The Verge, Starlink would be able to cut down transmission time and is expected to transfer data in just 15 milliseconds.

According to Tech Times, the company will need to launch six to 12 more Starlink missions in order to provide internet coverage to a larger global audience. 3833343]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PHOENIX — The U.S. Postal Service has started testing self-driving trucks to transport mail across three states.

According to Reuters, the USPS began a two-week pilot program using autonomous trucks from startup company TuSimple to carry the mail on five roundtrips between the distribution centers in Phoenix and Dallas.

Each one-way trip through Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas is over 1,600 kilometers, which will take 22 hours and include overnight driving.

The Verge reports that TuSimple trucks are equipped with nine cameras and two LIDAR sensors to help its vision-based system detect vehicles, pedestrians, and other obstacles up to 1,000 meters away.

According to a TuSimple press release, the autonomous trucks have a driver and safety engineer on board for the duration of the testing period.

USA Today reports that the pilot can have huge benefits for the Postal Service. It will also help validate TuSimple's system and speed up tech development and commercialization. 3833979]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SHANDONG, CHINA — CFC-11, a potent greenhouse gas and one of the main culprits in depleting the ozone layer, was set to be phased out by 2010.

But starting in 2012 scientists noticed a considerable slowdown in the decline of global concentrations of CFCs. 

The bulk of an increase of trichlorofluoromethane, better known as CFC-11, in the atmosphere has been found to originate from areas in eastern China, according to a new study published in the journal Nature.

The gas is believed to be stronger than carbon dioxide or methane in terms of its contribution to damaging effects from greenhouse emissions, the Guardian reports.

For the study, researchers from South Korea and Japan used air monitoring stations and created model simulations with the data they collected. They found the CFC-11 molecules originated from the northeastern Chinese provinces of Shandong and Hebei.

According to the study, CFC-11 emissions from these Chinese regions have increased by around 7,000 metric tons since 2013. This was a 110 percent increase compared emissions from 2008 to 2012, or 40 percent to 60 percent of the extra global CFC-11 emissions.

CFCs were once commonly be used in refrigerators, aerosol cans and dry cleaning chemicals before they were banned in 1987 due to their contribution to the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica under the Montreal Protocol.

The decline in CFC emissions was expected to allow the ozone layer to fully recover by mid-century, according to the New York Times. The increase of CFC-11 molecules in the atmosphere is expected to delay recovery by at least 10 years.

The Environmental Investigation Agency found CFC-11 was used to make polyurethane insulation by most of the firms in China they contacted. CFC-11 is cheaper and more effective than the alternatives.

In response to concerns regarding CFC emissions, a Chinese official was quoted by state-run news agency Xinhua as saying: The Chinese government has no tolerance for any illegal production of ozone-depleting substances. 3833948]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Mobile networks around the globe have suspended orders of Huawei smartphones after US president Donald Trump added the Chinese company to an export blacklist, CNN reports.

The Chinese company is no longer allowed to use Google's Android system in its new devices. As a result, Huawei users won't be able to access apps that depend on Google, such as Gmail, Youtube and Google Maps.

According to CNN, the US Commerce Department has issued a temporary reprieve to allow Google's Android system to service existing Huawei smartphones for the next 90 days.

According to The Verge, major carriers in the UK such as Vodafone and EE have also suspended orders of Huawei devices.

The Verge cites Marc Allera, CEO of the BT Group which owns EE, as saying that the company wouldn't launch new Huawei smartphones until it is able to assure its clients of the phone's usability in the distant future.

Japanese mobile operator KDDI and Y! Mobile have both said they will bring a halt to the launch of Huawei's newest smartphones, according to the Associated Press. 3833727]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Plastic straws, cotton buds and drink stirrers to be banned in UK 3834640]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — Plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds with plastic stems will be banned from sale and use in England from next April, the government has confirmed. 
According to the Guardian, the move looks to reduce plastics pollution and other environmental impacts of the almost 5 billion plastic straws tossed each year in the UK, in addition to 300 million plastic stirrers and only around 2 billion cotton buds with plastic stems. 
The Guardian reports that alternatives are already in place including paper straws and biodegradable products instead of plastic stirrers and cotton buds.  
According to the Guardian, the only exceptions to the new rule will be for people with medical needs or disabilities, for whom plastic straws and other materials will be available upon request. 

Registered pharmacies will be permitted to sell plastic straws, over the counter and online. 

According to the BBC, bars and restaurants will not be allowed to display plastic straws or automatically hand them out, but will provide them if people ask. 
The BBC reports that medical and scientific laboratories will still be able to buy plastic-stemmed cotton buds for use in research and for criminal investigation forensics. 
Is the ban going too far? Or not far enough? 3834640]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[DAZHOU, CHINA — A lovely couple decided to celebrate China's Valentine's Day on Monday with some good old public shaming. 
According to The Cover, a man was lucky enough to get slapped across his face dozens of times by his awesome girlfriend because he didn't buy her a new smartphone. 
Surveillance camera and cell phone footage from a street in Dazhou, Sichuan province shows Little Miss Sunshine going nuclear on her boyfriend, introducing the back of her hand to his face repeatedly while he just stands there obediently. 
While the woman continued to rain down forehands and backhands, the po po finally showed up to take the two lovebirds away. 
The boyfriend tried to tell the cops that he deserved it. The police said she normally pays for all the boyfriend's expenses.
Apparently she asked for a phone, which he failed to deliver on, so she did what any normal person would do. 

In the end, the cops had better things to do and made the couple promise to keep the drama at home. 3834638]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — NASA plans to launch three Artemis moon missions as well as five other separate launches to build a lunar orbit station in the next five years, according to NASA's website.

Artemis 1 is an uncrewed flight set to be launched in 2020 and will test the spacecraft's capabilities of reaching lunar orbit.

Artemis 2 will be a manned mission and is expected to be launched two years later. It would take a different route than the previous flight and its target is to take a space crew around the moon.

Around the same time, NASA will be sending parts of a lunar orbital station named the Gateway to the moon via private companies.

The Gateway will consist of a power and propulsion element and a small habitat module.

Artemis 3 will take a space crew and dock at the Gateway, before the crew makes its way down to the moon via a lander.

According to NASA, all three Artemis missions will be launched by NASA's Space Launch System on the Orion spacecraft.

NASA said this is part of its plan to ultimately make its way from the moon to the Red Planet to make human exploration of Mars a reality. 3835320]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SHENYANG, CHINA — A 3-year-old Chinese girl born with 14 fingers had a successful operation to remove the extra digits. 

According to Chinese site NetEase, she is part of the fifth generation in her family to be born with super grip. 
The little patient was treated at the Central Hospital in the Shenyang Medical College located in China's Liaoning province. 
According to local Chinese reports, doctors expect the little girl to grow up with full use of both of her 5-fingered hands. 
According to hand surgery specialist Dr Zhan Jie—who performed the operation—the girl had two extra fingers on each hand, making her quite a unique case. 

The delicate operation also inserted metal rods into her hands to straighten the fingers and redirect bone growth in her newly remodeled thumbs. 
According to Dr. Zhan, it's been a month since her operation, and so far it looks like two big thumbs up. 3835308]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SHEXIAN, CHINA — A horse somehow got free in Anhui province last week and ran loose through the streets, running over one unsuspecting woman. 
According to footage posted on Miaopai, surveillance video from last Tuesday in Shexian county shows the horse galloping down the street toward two women.
Other people on the street can be seen caught off guard by the bronco trotting down the street. 
Unfortunately, the elderly woman turned around too late to see the stallion charging up on her and took the full brunt of the collision. 
Apparently, the horse injured two other people on its run around the city. 
The unlucky animal was eventually corned by police in an alley and was finally put down after several attempts.  
According to authorities, the horse was probably being used in a wedding and got loose. 3835303]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Wendy's employee seen bathing in kitchen sink in viral video 3835282]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MILTON, FLORIDA — A video of an employee taking a warm bath in a Wendy's kitchen sink has gone viral overnight, and it's landed the store in hot water with customers.

The Pensacola News Journal reports that the 33-second long Snapchat video was screen recorded and posted to Facebook by Haley Leach, who found the video disturbing.

It shows a male employee at a Wendy's in Milton, Florida in nothing but a pair of shorts, stepping into an industrial sink filled with soapy water.

He sits in the sink  with water up to his chest, as laughter can be heard in the background.

The woman behind the camera swivels briefly to show two other employees recording the bath, before instructing her bathing coworker to wash his armpits, and then grabbing some napkins for him to use.

She ends the video by flipping the camera to show her face, and we see that she's also wearing a Wendy's employee hat.

The video has been shared over 16,000 times, and has nearly 4,000 comments. Many locals expressed disgust and vowed never to visit that particular Wendy's again.

According to NWF Daily News, the owners of the Wendy's store said in a statement that the incident was a prank by someone who was no longer working at the restaurant.

The store remained open and has since passed an inspection from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation. 3835282]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Philippine measles outbreak one of the worst in the world 3835233]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Imagine being sick with the measles and having to share the same bed with two other infected children, or bunk down on a makeshift ward in the hospital parking lot in the heat of summer.

That's what it was like for the kids at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, according to NPR, and those were the lucky ones. 

In a WHO report, patients said they were turned away at several different hospitals simply because there was no room. Hospitals have had to focus on treating measles complications, and limit admissions to patients with other diseases.

NPR reports that the Philippines has had one of the world's most devastating measles outbreaks since January — 33,000 infected, and 466 dead.

To try and contain the outbreak, the government undertook a nationwide measles vaccination campaign. While this seemed to slow it down significantly, hundreds of new cases still present each week. 

It's difficult enough to get Filipinos vaccinated under normal circumstances. The health care budget is low, as is the average family income; and transportation is difficult in a country that spans 7,107 islands.   

But a dengue vaccine scandal two years ago left many parents scared of inoculations, and distrustful of the Department of Health. 

NPR reports that while measles in the Philippines is still classified as an epidemic, the worst appears to be over.

Anna Ong-Lim, head of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines, told NPR that one silver lining is that many Filipinos were drawn back into the health system to get themselves or their loved ones vaccinated.

Still, there's a lot of work to be done, not just in immunizations, but in rebuilding public trust in the system. 

Over the last three months, the health department has vaccinated over 5.5 million people, and are aiming to have the number reach 20 million by the end of September. 3835233]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[XI'AN, CHINA — Streets in Xi'an China were flooded with a mysterious foam that didn't seem to stop spewing out of manholes, leaving people perplexed and disgusted, reports  China news site The Paper.

The sewage snow began oozing out of underground pipes on Tuesday afternoon coating 200 meters of the city's street. 

Videos show workers attempting to wash out the foam, only to see it bubble out of the manholes immediately after. 

They kept washing the foam until it was completely cleaned up by road washing trucks in the evening. 

Concerned residents claimed the street was left with a pungent smell but the following day authorities announced the foam was a result of an agent used in construction by a neighboring concrete company and that it was harmless to humans. 

Some netizens found the whole incident comical, one brought the foam to life saying,  Hello, I am just super efficient clothes detergent, don't be afraid! 

Others were more skeptical of the local authorities' diagnosis, one netizen said, If it is safe for the environment and health, why don't experts try eating it? Now that would be an interesting experiment. 3835190]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA['MURICA — A video of U.S. House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi seemingly slurring her words during a Center for American Progress event has gone viral. But it turns out, someone just used some clever video editing to make her sound as if she was drunk.

According to CNN, a group called Politics WatchDog posted the doctored video on May 22.

The edited video was then shared extensively across social media sites such as Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook, reports The Washington Post.

It was picked up by the conservative media and even shared by Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's attorney, who tweeted: What is wrong with Nancy Pelosi? Her speech pattern is bizarre. Giuliani has since deleted the tweet.

As soon as information about the manipulated clip got out, the LA Times reports that Youtube took down the clip.

However, it took Facebook more than a day to take down the same video, according to CNN. Explaining the delay, Facebook said they had to get their audio and digital forensics experts to verify that the video had been manipulated.

The video is currently still available on Facebook, even after confirmation that it was indeed altered. The Washington Post cites Facebook as saying that : We don't have a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true.

Twitter declined to comment on the altered video and has yet to take any formal action, according to the LA Times.

This has raised questions about how prepared Facebook and other social media giants are for the 2020 elections.

The Washington Post reports that manipulated videos that go viral could shape public perception as we get closer and closer to the presidential elections next year. 3835179]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[KAWASAKI, JAPAN — A mass stabbing in the city of Kawasaki, Japan on Tuesday morning has left over a dozen school children wounded and one child dead, Japanese broadcaster NHK reports.

An elementary school girl and a man in his 30s were believed to have died in the attack, according to The Japan Times.

As many as 16 other school children were injured in the attack while waiting at a bus stop, NHK reports. According to Kyodo News, two other adults were also wounded.

The news agency cites police as saying that two of the school girls and a woman in her 40s suffered serious injuries because of the attack.

The suspect was a man in his 50s, police told Kyodo News. He was seen holding knives in both hands. Police say the suspect stabbed victims before stabbing himself in the neck. Officers later found two knives that were believed to be used during the attack.

The children were believed to be students at Cartitas Elementary School. However, according to The Japan Times, officials at the elementary school could not immediately confirm if the victims were their students. 

They added that they are still gathering information. 3835880]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WOLONG NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE — A fully albino giant panda was filmed in the wild for the first time, roaming a bamboo forest in China. 
According to CNN, reserve management officials said on Saturday the pandariffic footage was taken on an infrared camera in April in Wolong National Nature Reserve, around 6,562 above sea level in China's Sichuan province. 
According to researcher Li Sheng from Beijing's Peking University talking to CNN, no completely albino panda has ever been recorded in the wild before. 
Talking to Chinese state propaganda station CCTV, he said the panda is probably only 1 or 2-years-old. 
According to CNN, the reserve is planning to set up more infrared cameras in order to follow its growth and to study how it interacts with other pandas in the area. 
According to National Geographic, animals with albinism lack the skin pigment melanin and can be at greater risk from predators because they tend to stick out a bit. 
According to Li talking to the SCMP, while the mutation is not harmful to panda physiology, it may make it more sensitive to the sun. Isn't that what sunscreen is for? 3835835]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Chinese censors on high alert as Tiananmen anniversary nears 3835818]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — The most sensitive day of the year for the Chinese interwebs is drawing near, and putting China's robot censors on high alert.

June 4, 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, or the bloody massacre that never happened, as far as China is concerned.

The Guardian reports that in 1989, government tanks violently cleared student-led protests for democratic reform in a deadly crackdown. No official death toll has ever been released, but estimates range from several hundred to several thousand. 

Since then, Beijing has been systematically erasing all evidence and memory of the bloody protests, and blocking any associated content with increasingly hi-tech precision.

According to a Reuters report, Chinese censors have reached a new level of accuracy, thanks to machine learning and voice and image recognition.

Censorship of the Tiananmen protests and other forbidden topics is largely automated. 
Posts that include related dates, names, and images are automatically rejected. 

Reuters reports that the periods leading up to a political event or anniversary, like this one, are especially sensitive. This year, social media censorship has even targeted LGBT groups, NGOs, and labor and environmental activists.

Four censors working across Chinese internet companies Beijing Bytedance, Weibo, and Baidu censor 5,000 to 10,000 pieces of information daily, or about five to seven pieces per minute.

Companies are responsible for censoring their own platforms. For news, they play it really safe by sticking to a simple rule that it's not authorized if it's not from state media. 

Otherwise, they run the risk of being punished for failing to properly censor, and hit with days to weeks-long suspensions, which is what happened to the Netease news app, Tencent news app Tian Tian, and Sina Corp over the past six weeks.

It's not any better for individual internet users, who can receive penalties  about sensitive issues online. 3835818]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GLASGOW, SCOTLAND / OSLO, NORWAY — Downloading and streaming music on online platforms is contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, according to a new study by the Universities of Glasgow and Oslo.

Researchers converted the amount of plastic production and electricity generation to represent the amount of resources and energy being used to download and stream music online, referring to them as greenhouse gas equivalents.

Music streaming in the U.S. was estimated to have produced between 200 million to 350 million kilograms of greenhouse gas in 2016, according to a University of Glasgow news release. That is the approximate amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated by what is needed to transmit and store digital music files.

According to the news release, this is an increase from 140 million kilograms of greenhouse gas equivalents in 1977, 136 million kilograms in 1988, and 157 million kilograms in 2000.

Dr Kyle Devine, who led the study, was quoted by the University of Glasgow news release as saying : From a carbon emissions perspective … the transition towards streaming recorded music from internet-connected devices has resulted in significantly higher carbon emissions than at any previous point in the history of music.

Devine told The Rolling Stone that the figure does not include the carbon footprint of data storage and processing in data centers or the amount of electricity needed to power a digital device. processing in data centers or the amount of electricity needed to power a digital device. 3835679]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SWEDEN — As part of a country-wide push to raise sustainability awareness in Sweden, various McDonald's franchises are installing bee hives called McHives on their rooftops. 
According to Greenpeace, honeybees perform 80 percent of all pollination. Seventy out of the top 100 human food crops—which provide 90 percent of the world's nutrition—are pollinated by bees.    

However, overuse of pesticides and climate change are now causing global bee populations to decline. 
According to AdWeek, McDonald's in a partnership with marketing firm Nord DDB commissioned the project to raise awareness by creating bee hives that look like miniature replicas of McDonald's stores. 
The idea of a fully-functioning beehive began at one store in Sweden and has now expanded to five in the country. 
The hives were built by designer Nickals Nilsson. They are built to scale and include the McDonald's sign, a drive-thru, and patio seating.     

McDonald's marketing director in Sweden Christoffer Rönnblad said, we have a lot of really devoted franchisees who contribute to our sustainability work, and it feels good that we can use our size to amplify such a great idea as bee hives on the rooftops. 3836408]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Popular iPhone apps use hidden trackers to share user data 3836384]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO — A privacy test conducted by Washington Post columnist Geoffrey Fowler has found that popular iPhone apps are using trackers and sharing user data, sometimes including sensitive information like email, phone number, location, and IP address.

In a single week, Fowler encountered 5,400 data trackers, mostly within apps, which according to privacy firm Disconnect would send out 1.5 gigabytes of data in a month.

In most cases, users are not aware that this is happening, or that the trackers are even present.

Trackers can have different purposes. Some analyze user behavior in order to let apps improve performance, create targeted ads, or help identify fraud.

But according to Disconnect Chief Technology Officer Patrick Jackson, there is a lack of transparency. Often, trackers don't anonymize data or limit retention time, and users aren't given clear information on where collected data is going or who it's shared with. 

According to Fowler, it's especially disappointing coming from Apple, which claims its software and hardware are designed to provide advanced security and privacy at every level of the system.

He suggested that Apple require apps to label when they are using third-party trackers, or add privacy controls to give users more visibility.

In the meantime, concerned iOS users can turn off 'Background App Refresh' in settings, or use a VPN to limit the data that apps are able to send to third party companies. 3836384]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[KATHMANDU, NEPAL — An American lawyer died Monday while descending Mount Everest, marking the 11th death so far this year.

Another American, three Indians, two British, and two Irish climbers died while climbing the Nepali side of the summit. Two others died on the Tibetan route.

According to the BBC, the average annual death rate for Everest climbers remained at about six over the past two decades. So why is the 2019 climbing season that much more deadly?

The New York Times reports that while May is the best time of the year to climb Mount Everest, there are only a certain number of days when the winds are mild and it is clear enough to summit.

Danduraj Ghimire, director general of Nepal's Department of Tourism attributes the large number of Everest deaths this year to fewer good weather days - just five in 2019 compared with between seven to 12 in recent years.

Another critical issue is overcrowding. The government issued a record number of 381 permits in 2019, a number which does not yet include guides.

During the week of May 20, crowds of climbers were stuck in a queue on the single route to the summit, a narrow ridge known as the death zone.

CNN reports the Everest summit is at an elevation where each breath contains only ⅓ of the oxygen at sea level. Most people can only spend minutes at the summit without extra supplies.

According to Sherpas and climbers, some of those who died had been held up in the long lines, and could not ascend and descend fast enough to replenish their oxygen.
Others were inexperienced climbers led by equally inexperienced guides, while still others were simply not fit enough to be on the summit.

The BBC reports that experienced mountaineers have long suggested the Nepalese government to impose certain requirements for climbers, in the interest of safety.

But safety on the mountain, according to Nepali officials, is the responsibility of the trekking companies, many of which are also shady and unqualified. 3836372]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[New plastic-eating microbes found underneath the ocean 3836278]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHANIA, GREECE — Scientists have found tiny microbes that are able to break down plastic waste found in the ocean, according to a study published in Science Magazine.

The bacteria has been named Ideonella Sakaiensis.[i][j]

In a separate study, researchers from the Technical University of Crete experimented with the bacteria. They collected samples of weathered plastic such as polyethylene and polystyrene debris from two different beaches in Greece.

According to The European Scientist, polyethylene is commonly used to make plastic bags while polystyrene is typically used in food packaging.

The researchers immersed both types of plastic in saltwater from the sea, according to Science Magazine.

One batch had naturally-occurring ocean microbes added to the water, while the other had bacteria enhanced with carbon-eating microbe strains. The plastic-consuming microbes were used to speed up the chemical reactions normally required to break down plastic.

After five months, the scientists weighed the plastic debris and found that the polyethylene had a weight reduction of 7 percent, while the polystyrene had a weight reduction of 11 percent.

According to the study, the microbes could offer an attempt at solving the problem of plastic pollution. 

However, more research would be needed to see how effective the bacteria would be on a larger scale. 3836278]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LAKE CHARLES, LOUISIANA — Two men from Texas are no longer with us after they attempted to Dukes of Hazzard an open drawbridge in Louisiana, police said. 

According to a Facebook post by the Louisiana State Police, driver Alejandro Cazares, 23 and passenger Roberto Alejandro Moreno, 32, approached the Black Bayou Bridge about 6 miles south of Lake Charles around 2 a.m. last Friday night. 
According to NBC News, investigators said the bridge was closed to traffic and up to let a boat pass. 
Police say an eyewitness then saw Moreno then got out of the 2016 Chevrolet Cruze and actually push the gate arm up.
Cazares then drove then car under the gate, picked Moreno up and then drove the Cruze toward the end of the open drawbridge. 
After stopping for a moment, Cazares popped the car in reverse, then the two accelerated forward and actually tried to Fast and Furious the gap. 
The car went airborne, but then gravity kicked in and the Chevy landed in the water and sank to the bottom. 
Toxicology samples were obtained and were sent in for analysis. 3836150]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NANNING, CHINA — A woman from Nanning blew $29,000 dollars on probably the best parking space in all of China. 

According to Pear Video, the woman paid for the premier parking spot last August without even looking at it—baller. 
According to the Shanghaiist, the space is located super conveniently next to the parking garage elevator. 
Only problem is, it's also jammed between two walls with just enough space for a car to squeeze in. 
So that means you can't actually use your car doors to get in and out—sweet. 
Luckily the woman has a BMW with a sunroof, which now doubles as a door. 
When she asked the developer for her money back, he answered with a big old—HELL NO—and hilariously suggested her to sell it to some other dope instead. 

According to the Shanghaiist, apparently building regulations say there should be a minimum of 60 centimeters or space around a parking spot. 
Tao is now planning to settle the matter in court. Good thing Chinese people NEVER EVER get screwed over in court. 3837015]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPEI — Taiwanese officials confirmed over the weekend the first meeting between senior U.S. and Taiwanese security officials in more than four decades. 
According to Reuters, Taiwan's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on Saturday that national security chief David Lee met White House national security adviser John Bolton earlier this month.
The Central News Agency reported that it was the first meeting since Taiwan and the U.S. ended formal diplomatic ties in 1979. 
Cue the butthurt Chinese. In typical authoritarian fashion, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a news briefing, China is extremely dissatisfied and resolutely opposed to this. 
He also said China was against any form of official exchange between the U.S. and Taiwan. 
Beijing seems to be a big fan of playing that same old broken record. 
According to Reuters, the rare meeting will be viewed by Taiwan as a sign of support from the Trump administration. 
According to MOFA's statement, the meeting took place during Lee's May 13 to 21 visit to the U.S. 
It also said, during the trip, together with U.S. government officials, Secretary-General Lee met with representatives from our diplomatic allies, reiterating support and commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region. 
Hold up—Taiwan still has diplomatic allies? 3837013]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CASHMERE, WASHINGTON — A man was slick enough to accidentally blast his own McNuggets at an apartment in Cashmere last month, but luckily for us, that was only Chapter One. 
According to a probable cause affidavit filed on April 16 in Chelan County Superior Court, 27-year-old Cameron Jeffrey Wilson had his piece tucked into his front pocket on April 5 when he accidentally popped a round off right through the family jewels and into his thigh. 
According to affidavit, BALLS—eye then told his girlfriend to first drive him to a friend's house, so he could drop off his piece. As a 13-time felon, it's illegal for Wilson to carry firearms. 
According to the Wenatchee World, as doctors and nurses were stitching the American Self-Sniper up, a balloon contain some sticky icky slipped out of the old prison wallet. 
When Chelan County sheriff's officers were notified the Testicular Terminator had suffered a gunshot wound, they responded to the hospital and searched his ride and found a bag of Breaking Bad inside a pair of jeans he'd taken off before going in the hospital. 
Wilson wasn't arrested at the hospital, but police issued a warrant on suspicion of a second-degree felony in possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of crystal. He was charged on April 16. 
When the smooth criminal turned himself in during an examination, another buddha balloon snuck out the backdoor. 
He was then arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance in a correctional facility. 
From the slammer, Einstein then called his girlfriend several times telling her not to snitch, but of course the authorities were listening in. 
Kingpin was subsequently charged with counts of tampering with a witness. 
According to the Wenatchee World, the three incidents will be tried in superior court as three separate cases. 
He's currently being held at the regional justice center on a combined $110,000 bail, while he awaits his trials. 3837002]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ZHENGZHOU, CHINA — A man in China got himself in knee-deep trouble with the Chinese internet, after being caught on video being a major d-bag to airline staff.

According to The Paper, the bad behavior went down at Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport in Henan, where the unidentified male passenger had been waiting to board a budget West Air flight from Zhengzhou to Guangzhou. 

When his flight was delayed due to bad weather, the guy did not take it well.

Footage of the incident shows him and a group of his other passengers gathered around a counter manned by an airline employee.

The angry man, who is wearing a black and yellow striped shirt, points his finger at the employee and demands that he kneel down and apologize to them. He reasons that the employee should do it on behalf of his company, and that it's sincere to kneel down, isn't it? 

The airline employee responded by saying that while he was a member of the staff and could apologize for the delay, there was no need to insult and humiliate him by asking him to kneel.

Other passengers looked uncomfortable with the exchange, and one finally chimed in asking what the point of an apology would be.

Needless to say, striped shirt is now internet famous for all the wrong reasons. 

He should take his own advice and kneel to show sincerity when he ends up on China's infamous travel blacklist. 3836996]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA —A man in China has gone viral after he shared DIY videos of himself using ramen noodles to repair random items on Chinese social media site Douyin[b], The South China Morning Post reports.

In one video, the man appears to be crushing the noodles and then using them to patch up a broken part of the bowl. He adds some glue, waits for it to cool and he then smooths it out with a chisel, paints over it and the bowl is as good as new.

In another video, the man attempts to repair a car dent with the instant noodles. He uses the same method of crushing the noodles, then adds some adhesive onto the dent. Next, he shaves off the excess noodles, smooths it out once again and sprays over the dent.

But ramen noodles are not the only trick he's got up his sleeve. Previous videos have shown him using egg shells, tissue papers and even oreo cookies to fix everyday items, according to the South China Morning Post.

Some internet commentators have said that the instant noodles may be good enough for a temporary fix. However, others have raised doubts on how authentic these videos actually are.

According to Newsweek, the video may have been sped up or edited in a certain way to make it appear as if he was actually repairing items with instant noodles. 3836836]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Leaked OPCW report finds Douma gas attack likely staged 3836619]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[DOUMA, SYRIA — A leaked document is casting doubt on the official narrative of the 2018 Douma gas attacks which were later used to justify American, British and French airstrikes on Syria.

The New York Times reports that on the night of April 7, 2018, Syrian military helicopters allegedly dropped chlorine bombs on the town of Douma, killing dozens of civilians.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons sent a fact-finding mission to investigate two sites where gas cylinders were found: a rooftop balcony and a bedroom. It later confirmed that toxic chemicals were used as a weapon in Douma.

According to the official OPCW report, the rooftop bomb first struck a corner of the balcony wall.

This initial impact decreased the cylinder's velocity and changed its trajectory, causing it to hit the concrete floor hard enough to make a hole and fracture the valve, but without sufficient energy to fall through.

However, a leaked OPCW engineering assessment report found that to create the crater, the cylinder would have had to have impacted it at a vertical or near vertical angle of inclination.

Simulations indicated that the minimal damage sustained by the cylinder was incompatible with having hit both the wall and floor. Impact with the floor's steel rebar alone should have resulted in substantial deformation.

The appearance of the crater was also more consistent with being the result of mortar or artillery round blast, in particular the fragmentation pattern and scorching on the underside of the hole.

At the bedroom location, the official OPCW report maintains that the chlorine-filled cylinder fell parallel to the roof of a building and crashed through the concrete.

It fell through and briefly impacted the floor, then continued forward on an altered trajectory that landed it on the bed. The harness and valve remained intact, and its contents were not discharged.

But the leaked OPCW report contends that the cylinder could not have fit through the crater with the valve intact. Deformation on the cylinder was consistent with falling flat on a horizontal surface, not crashing through concrete.

It also couldn't establish any set of circumstances that would have resulted in the cylinder moving from the floor to the bed.

The engineering assessment concludes that the cylinders were likely not dropped from an aircraft at either location, and that there is a higher probability that they were manually placed at the two sites.

The leaked report has been confirmed as genuine after the OPCW, in reply to Peter Hitchens of the Mail on Sunday, said it was investigating the unauthorized release of the document in question.

Mainstream media outlets that religiously covered the Douma chemical attacks and the subsequent military response are now silent over the dissenting document. 

Many supported, perhaps even pushed, the official narrative, including the New York Times. The paper had a virtual crime scene analysis based on superficial observations and concluded the cylinders were dropped from helicopters. 

The implications of a staged attack, however, extend to more than just what happened in Syria. It also calls into question whether seemingly independent international organizations like the OPCW are helping push an agenda in the service of certain governments. 3836619]]></video:description>
