      <video:title><![CDATA[Facebook busted for paying teens to spy on their phones 3774718]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA — A TechCrunch investigation has revealed that Facebook has been paying teens and other users for access to private data.

The social network has reportedly been paying users aged 13 to 35 $20 a month in gift cards to install the 'Facebook Research' app, a VPN that monitors web and app activity and sends it back for market research.

The app requires Root Certificate access, allowing 'nearly limitless access to a user's device.' We're talking private messages, emails, web searches, browsing activity — the whole gamut.

It's even asked users to take a screenshot of their Amazon order history.

The app, which is also referred to as Project Atlas, works similar to Onavo Protect, another Facebook VPN that was banned by Apple last year for violating its data collection policies.

Not surprisingly, Project Atlas was also violating those same policies, and has been blocked on Apple's iOS platform.

But Facebook's not the only one secretly peddling a data collector. Google's Screenwise Meter app bears a striking resemblance to Facebook Research.

Screenwise Meter invites users aged 18 and up to participate, though teens as young as 13 can join if they're part of a family group.

Like Facebook Research, the iOS version uses Apple's enterprise developer program, which allows apps with special privileges to be distributed but only to the company's employees, according to The Verge.

Google's app has since been disabled on iOS. A spokesperson has also come out to apologize and Screenwise Meter shouldn't have operated on the enterprise developer program. 3774718]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TWITTER — CNN reports that the release of two projects on notorious serial killer Ted Bundy has put him firmly back on people's minds...among other places.

A docuseries on the Ted Bundy tapes recently dropped on Netflix, but instead of being repulsed, folks are thirsting after the murderer because of how hot he is.

Adding fuel to this demented fire is the fact that an upcoming film has Bundy being played by heartthrob Zac Efron.

Yeah, sure, there's rarely logic in desire, but Ted Bundy? Hot? Sure, maybe in the electric chair he went kaput in.

According to GQ, it's all gotten so bad that a horrified Netflix has had to address the disturbing phenomenon via Twitter in an effort to slap some sense into viewers.

The streaming service basically pointed out that there are thousands of other hot Netflix dudes to fawn over who aren't convicted serial murderers.

No one's denying the guy's charms and good looks, because that was his whole facade. But let's not forget he was a necrophiliac, rapist, and literal lady killer responsible for the deaths of over 30 women.

Think about that for a hot second before you fantasize about calling him daddy. 3774711]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Two hacker groups stole $1B from cryptocurrency exchanges 3774625]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK — Two hacker groups are responsible for a majority of the cybercrime carried out against cryptocurrency exchanges, alleges a new report. Combined, the two groups have stolen roughly $1 billion in cryptocurrency. 
According to Bitcoin.com, digital surveillance company Chainalysis identified two groups behind many of the hacks in the field in its latest crypto crime report.
Analysts say on average, each hack from either of the two groups involved around $90 million per incident. 
Chainalysis says the first hacking group is a giant, tightly controlled organization that could be driven in part by non-monetary goals. The second group is smaller, less organized and more brazen, but primarily focused on money. 
According to the report, at least 50 percent of stolen cryptocurrency were converted into hard currency through some type of conversion service within 112 days of the hacks. 
Chainalysis said 64.3 percent of the funds were sent to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, 11.9 percent to peer-to-peer exchanges and the other 23.8 percent used conversion services such as mixing services, bitcoin ATMs and gambling sites. 
The report found, exchanges are regularly processing the stolen funds, allowing the hackers to convert the funds to traditional currencies or other cryptocurrencies. 

This is due to the fact that the stolen funds look like they are coming from the legitimate owners to the exchanges not hacked. 

It can also be difficult for exchanges to tell if cryptocurrency has been stolen without having specialized investigation software. 3774625]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Artificial skin could have crazy sensing abilities 3774618]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MANSFIELD, CONNECTICUT — A new type of sensor developed by researchers could lead to artificial skin that could help burn victims feel and help protect workers, according to a paper in Advanced Materials.
The skin's ability to sense pressure, heat, cold and vibration is an important safety function. Burn victims, those with prosthetic limbs and others who have lost skin sensitivity can often hurt themselves on accident. 
According to UConn Today, researchers from the University of Connecticut and University of Toronto wanted to create a sensor that could mimic the sensing abilities of the skin, as well as the ability to detect magnetic fields and sound waves. 
The scientists made a sensor with a silicone tube wrapped in a copper wire and filled with a solution of iron oxide nanoparticles.
An electric current is created when the nanoparticles rub the inside of the silicone tube, which is picked up as a signal from the copper wire. 
Researchers were able to distinguish between pressure, sound waves and magnetic fields. They were also able to tell the differences between electrical signals caused by walking, running, jumping and swimming. 
The team hope the sensors will someday be able to help burn victims feel again or be used as an early warning system for workers exposed to high magnetic fields. 
The scientists will now work to see if they can make a functional sensor into a flat configuration more like skin. 3774618]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[NASA releases new photos of Bennu asteroid 3774413]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C. —  NASA has shared new images of asteroid Bennu taken by its OSIRIS-REx space probe.  

NASA's OSIRIS-REx satellite has taken new photos of Bennu, the 4.5 billion-year-old asteroid that some scientists believe could give us clues to the origins of life.

OSIRIS-REx is on a sample-return mission. Its main goal is to collect a sample of Bennu's soil and return it to Earth for analysis.

On January 22, NASA shared new imagery of the asteroid's southern hemisphere. They captured these photos using the space probe's NavCam imager. This technology not only allows OSIRIS-REx to snap photos of the space rock but also monitors its path around it.

At around 500-meters wide, Bennu is thought to be the smallest space object ever to be orbited by a manmade satellite. So far OSIRIS-REx has already completed 10 orbits around the asteroid. It takes the probe roughly 62 hours to complete one orbit at a speed of 5 centimeters per second.

As the space probe circles around Bennu, the mission team uses the collected data to select a location for a sample collection in July 2020.

According to OSIRIS-REx's Twitter account, the spacecraft is more than 95 million kilometers away from Earth. At that distance, it takes the probe over ten minutes to send and then receive communications with its control team at NASA.

The asteroid has been in the space agency's sights since it was discovered by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research survey on September 11, 1999.

The asteroid comes close to Earth every six years. NASA estimates there is a one in 2,700 chance of it hitting our planet in the next century. 3774413]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BREMERHAVEN, GERMANY — A group of researchers from a nonprofit research institute called Nekton is leading a  three-year-expedition to explore the Indian Ocean, reports the Associated Press.

The team will leave the coast of Bremerhaven, Germany on January 25 on a diving vessel called the Ocean Zephyr headed to the Seychelles.

The Seychelles is an archipelago comprised of 115 islands with an exclusive economic zone that covers roughly 1.4 million square kilometers. The country has committed to protecting 30 percent of its national waters.

According to Nekton, the team will spend seven weeks mapping the ocean floor, studying underwater life and dropping sensors to depths of 2,000 meters in the waters surrounding the Seychelles. 

The mission plans to conduct at least 50 first descents in areas around the islands. Their main objective is to gather data that will be used for environmental conservation.

The team will be providing live broadcasts of their descents using new subsea communication technologies. The mission's principal scientist, Lucy Woodall, stated: 'We expect to discover dozens of species new to science that could be anything from new corals, algae or sponges to larger more charismatic animals like dog-sharks.' 3774297]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MIAMI —  World's longest waterslide at sea will be on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship.

Royal Caribbean is going big with its most recent ship makeover by installing the world's longest waterslide on one of its ships.

Royal Caribbean's Navigator of the Seas vessel is undergoing a $115 million remodeling. This includes the construction of the world's longest waterslide at sea measuring roughly 244 meters in length. 

According to Geek, the new slide called The Blaster will have the capacity of launching a two-person raft down the slide using five waterjets. A section of the slide protrudes off the edge of the ship and other areas of the tube are transparent giving guests a unique view of the ocean. 

Opposite to The Blaster is another slide called Riptide. This mat-racer slide also has a transparent part that curves off the side of the cruise ship.

The revamped Navigator of the Seas will be launched again on February 24. It will be setting sail from the coast of Miami to the Bahamas. 3774274]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Dutch design lab proposes turning space junk into fireworks 3774155]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[ALMERE, NETHERLANDS — A Dutch design company has come up with ideas of how to dispose of space junk turning them into fireworks is one of the options, reports Inhabitat.

Dutch artist Daan Roosegaarde has come up with two rough ideas to dispose of space waste...but his pictures are real pretty.

The European Space Agency and Dutch design lab Studio Roosegaarde are collaborating to find sustainable methods to dispose of space waste.

According to NASA, there are currently 500,000 pieces of space debris orbiting Earth at speeds of over 28,100 kilometers per hour. 

One of the proposals is called Shooting Stars. This project aims to pull orbiting space debris back into Earth's atmosphere. As the objects re-enter they would burst into flames creating fake shooting stars or dancing lights similar to a firework show.

The second concept proposed by the design lab consists of somehow creating sustainable 3D-print buildings and structures using space junk. These would be used to develop living spaces for human colonies on the Moon.

Currently, the design lab is exhibiting The Space Waste Lab Performance, an outdoor artwork comprised of LED lights that track space waste traveling above Earth's atmosphere. This is also a result of the collaboration with the European Space Agency.

Artists and scientists don't often mix but ESA Director Franco Ongaro thinks it's a better idea than most think stating, this cooperation is all the more important when dealing with issues like space debris, which may one day impact our future, and our ability to draw maximum benefits from space. 3774155]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[OSLO — The Norwegian Public Roads Administration plans to build floating tunnels as part of a coastal highway that would run between Kristiansand and Trondheim, according to the agency's website. 

It currently takes 21 hours and 7 ferry crossing to travel between these two cities, according to NPR.

The new Coastal Highway Route would include bridges as well as submerged floating tunnels that would connect different fjords, CNN reports. It is expected to cut travel time by half.

The floating tunnels would be installed around 30 meters under the water, according to CNN.

The tunnels would be anchored to the seabed or to pontoons which would float on the surface of the water, CNN reports. This will help in stabilizing the structure. It will then function as an ordinary tunnel, allowing vehicles to drive from one end to the other.

If Norway succeeds, this could be the world's first underwater floating tunnel. 3774152]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND — As the Midwest freezes, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration observing our planet through satellite technology.

The NOAA have released satellite images of the polar vortex as seen from space.

The NOAA is describing the polar vortex as a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding the Earth's North and South poles.

The article went on to explain that the cold Arctic air from the polar vortex is sent southward toward the U.S when the vortex starts to expand and becomes less stable.

NOAA's satellite captured stunning images of the effects of the polar vortex across the U.S.

Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit along with other cities in the Midwest have been suffering from extremely cold temperatures in the past few days, with temperatures reportedly dropping below -50 degrees in some areas, the Washington Post reports. 3775289]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Tyson recalls nuggets over possible rubber contamination 3775085]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SPRINGDALE, ARKANSAS — Tyson has recalled its chicken nuggets due to possible rubber contamination.

More than 36,000 pounds of chicken nuggets by Tyson Foods may contain extraneous materials, specifically rubber, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture news release.

The USDA is classifying the recall as a Class I Recall. This means this is a health hazard situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product could result in serious or adverse health consequences or even death.

The news release says the contaminated chicken nugget products labelled as Tyson White Meat Panko Chicken Nuggets were produced in November of last year.

Customers who purchased the nuggets had found soft, blue rubber inside the product, the New York Times reports.

Customers contacted the company, which is when the Food Safety and Inspection Service stepped in, according to the USDA.

Worth Sparkman, a spokesman for Tyson Foods, is cited by the New York Times as explaining that the rubber was part of a seal on a piece of equipment used to produce the chicken nuggets and was added into the nuggets blend.

Tyson Foods is now recalling more than 7,200 bags of chicken nuggets across the U.S., reports the New York Times.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service is urging those who have already purchased the product to either throw the nuggets away or return them to the store. 3775085]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM — A little man across the pond was doing what kids do when he accidentally got his head stuck in a toilet seat, according to LadBible. 
Apparently, a watch manager from Avon Fire and Rescue came home to find his son's head stuck in the toilet seat. 
The little guy somehow worked his way into the hole of a blue potty-training toilet seat, the kind made to fit on top of the toilet. 
After failing to get himself out of the jam, the professionals had to be called in. 
Guys from the Temple Fire Station shared snaps from the rescue over Twitter. 
Before the firefighters could remove the toilet seat, they had to protect little dude's face with some safety goggles and a plastic lid. 
The firefighters then had to go in with a spinning disc cutter to get Boss Baby's head out.

Luckily, Lil' Houdini made it out, no worse for wear. 3775059]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Sonars may be causing some whales to become suicidal 3775008]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LAS PALMAS, SPAIN — Sonar waves may spark suicidal behavior in whales, according to a new report published in Royal Society Proceedings B Journal. 

Sonar waves cause major distress for underwater mammals. They are thought to scare them away, but a new report suggests that the effects are deadly.

The report suggests suicidal behavior in some beaked whales is linked to exposure to sonar waves. 

Cuvier's beaked whales are deep divers with bodies capable of withstanding changing pressure. Their metabolism slows down to save oxygen and their organs adapt to avoid decompression sickness.

However, according to a report published in the when the whales come into contact with sonar waves emitted by naval patrols, they quickly swim away in fear and confusion. 

Nitrogen gas bubbles then accumulate in the whales' veins, causing brain hemorrhages and damage to their organs and nervous system, including their spinal cord. This unnatural, quick change in their diving pattern makes the animal accumulate nitrogen.

Beaked whales normally dive over 1,000 meters deep for one hour, but when exposed to sonar waves they swim for over two hours at depths of around 3,000 meters.

Once disoriented and hurt they tend to beach in nearby coasts. In 2003 a paper pointing out the possible link between sonar and whale deaths led to a 2004 ban on naval exercises around the Canary Islands.

Scientists behind the report have an idea for a solution. They suggest placing more moratoriums on mid-frequency sonar activity in regions where large groups of beached whales frequently appear. 3775008]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Fortnite gamer found Apple FaceTime bug days before story blew up 3774905]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[TUCSON, ARIZONA  —   A teenager detected a major FaceTime Apple security flaw a week before the company made the news public, reports The New York Times.

A fourteen-year-old spotted a massive Apple FaceTime bug over one week before news of it went viral while discussing Fornite gaming strategy with friends.

Now, for those of you not in the know, Apple recently announced its fixing a bug that let people eavesdrop on unknowing call recipients.

It doesn't take a skilled hacker to do it either. All you have to do is call someone on FaceTime, add another individual to the call and voila! The app automatically assumes it's an active group call and the first person's microphone becomes activated — even if they haven't picked up the phone.

Apple has disabled group FaceTimes while they are fixing the issue. However, users are now claiming actions could've been taken earlier had they listened to the teenage Fortnite fan and his concerned mother.

According to The New York Times, fourteen-year-old Grant Thompson and his mother Michele Thompson discovered the glitch a more than a week before the news of it blew up. Grant was using a group FaceTime call to discuss Fortnite strategy with friends when he discovered the flaw.

His mother, an Arizona lawyer, saw the potential risks of this security flaw and decided to report it to the company. Unfortunately, it wasn't easy to be heard.

Michele tweeted at the tech company and sent them several emails warning them about the glitch but got no response. Finally, she sent them a fax and an email with a video of her and her son demonstrating the flaw.

The company replied asking her to file the report through Apple's developer site. After all that, Michele, the concerned Apple customer, had to register as an Apple developer to report the glitch her son discovered. 

The company responded but they didn't fix the bug. Now that the news has gone viral, Michele hopes her son can get a little bit of credit for having detected the security flaw early. 

She told CNN, Apple should reward people for reporting things of this nature — not just reward the developers or the people who are savvy with tech. I think just thanking him would be great. 3774905]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Pocket lab can diagnose an infection in four minutes 3776733]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WARSAW, POLAND — EuroNews reports that a Polish startup has created a mini-lab prototype that can quickly and accurately diagnose infections.

SensDx is a pocket-sized diagnostic tool that can determine whether an infection is caused by a bacterium, virus, or fungi, in just four minutes.

The device is able to detect sensitive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae, both of which can cause inflammation in the throat.

Once a DNA swab is taken from a patient, it's placed in a special buffer with solution and dropped onto the SensDx electrode.

A detailed analysis of the infection will then appear on a connected mobile device, laptop, or desktop.

According to SensDx's CEO, the device will initially be available only to medical consultation centers for about 100 euros.

After two years, it can be given to patients, with data being transferred from home to the doctor's office.

According to EuroNews, SensDx has also developed diagnostic kits for animals, which will be similar to the human test kits, but will detect different pathogens. 3776733]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WOODBRIDGE, NEW JERSEY — CBS New York reports that a New Jersey man is facing fraud charges after his hilariously bad fake fall scam was caught on camera.

CCTV footage posted by the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office on Facebook shows Alexander Goldinsky in the empty cafeteria of an unnamed Woodbridge company where he was working as an independent contractor.

The 57-year-old can be seen tossing a cup of ice on the floor and then throwing the cup away. He stands over the ice for a while before clutching the counter and taking a very deliberate tumble to the floor.

CNN reports that according to the Prosecutor's Office, the man then stayed on the floor and waited to be discovered.

Goldinsky later filed an insurance claim for ambulance service to the local hospital, and treatment for injuries he supposedly sustained in the fall.

Needless to say, the CCTV outed his scam, and his hilariously bad acting.

He was arrested in January for insurance fraud and theft by deception, but has since been released with a summons until he faces a judge in February. 3776703]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM — Microplastics have been found in the digestive tracts of every marine mammal surveyed in a new study of animals washed up on Britain's beaches, according to scientists. 
According to the BBC, scientists from the University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Laboratory, or PML, looked at 50 animals, including 10 species of dolphins, seals and whales. 
According to the Guardian, researchers found that nylon made up more than 60 percent of the microplastics, coming from possible sources like fishing rope and nets, clothing microfibers and toothbrush bristles. 
Polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, and polyester were also widely present in the marine animals studied. 
According to the scientists, on average, 5.5 plastic particles were discovered in the guts of each animal. 

According to the BBC, 84 percent of the microplastics found were synthetic fibers, while the remaining were fragments of food packaging and plastic bottles. 
The results were published in the journal Scientific Reports. 3776702]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO — The FBI has accused a second Chinese Apple employee of trying to jack trade secrets from its autonomous car program, according to an unsealed affidavit. 
NBC Bay Area reported that according to the affidavit filed on Jan. 22, Jizhong Chen was hired by Apple in June 2018 as a hardware developer engineer to the autonomous car project. 
According to CNBC, Apple started to smell something fishy when an employee reported seeing Chen taking wide angled photographs in sensitive work spaces. 

According to the complaint, Apple then allegedly asked to inspect Chen's personal devices, where they found he had backed up his work computer onto a personal hard drive. 
According to the affidavit, Apple's review found around 100 photos taken inside Apple's autonomous vehicle building along with over two thousand files containing confidential and proprietary Apple material, including manuals, schematics and diagrams.
According to the complaint, Chen had also just applied for a job at a China-based self-driving car company that is a direct competitor with Apple's project.
Chen was arrested a day before he was about to high tail it back to China. Our advice...lock him up and throw away the key. 
According to NBC Bay Area, this is the second worker in six months to be accused by the FBI of stealing trade secrets from Apple's self-driving car division. 
Last July, former Chinese Apple employee Xiaolang Zhang was also busted by the FBI for also trying to jack Apple's autonomous car secrets for another Chinese rival. 3776697]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[IRAN — A gold-backed cryptocurrency called the Peyman has been launched in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
According to Iranian English paper Financial Tribune, the Ghoghnoos Company and four banks teamed up to offer the digital currency. The four partner banks are the Parsian Bank, Bank Melli Iran, Bank Pasargad and Bank Mellat. 

Over-the-counter exchange Iran Fara Bourse is also expected to offer the Peyman, which is the Persian word for covenant. 
According to a Ghoghnoos director, Peyman will be used to tokenize banks' assets and excess properties. 

Ghoghnoos has indicated one billion tokens will be available in the initial coin offering. The Peyman is also expected to be available for purchase on Iran Fara Bourse. 
According to Al Jazeera, the launch of the Peyman comes less than a week after Iran's central bank issued draft cryptocurrency regulations. 

Iran's central bank also gave the nod to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, bitcoin wallets and cryptocurrency mining. 3776693]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAICHUNG, TAIWAN — According to ETToday, riders at a theme park in Taiwan were left literally hanging after a roller coaster malfunctioned mid-ride.

The Gravity Max in Taichung's Lihpao Land is the world's first and only tilting roller coaster. Dubbed the cliffhanger, it brings riders to the edge of a horizontal platform, where it moves to a fully vertical tilt and connects to an entirely separate set of tracks.

Riders are made to stare a straight 90 degrees down, before the coaster drops them back into the ride.

It's a pretty scary ride, though not as scary as what these unlucky folks had to go through.

20 people were on the Gravity Max when it broke down around 3 p.m. on January 30. According to Apple Daily, the tracks failed to line up during the vertical tilt — twice.

Remember that 90 degree tilt? The world's unluckiest thrill seekers ended up staring it down for about half an hour before being rescued off the ride and walking down to solid ground.

The poor, probably traumatized riders were then given a measly $5 voucher for their troubles.

Theme park director Wang Yonghao told local media that the ride suffered a misalignment, which can happen during strong winds, heavy rain, or fog. This triggers the fail safe mechanism to kick in and prevent the train from being released, which, whew.

Engineers inspected the ride and reopened it 20 minutes later, with Wang emphasizing that the coaster is 100% safe. 3776622]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MARS — NASA's Curiosity rover is on the move again, but it didn't leave without posting a cheeky selfie on its Twitter account. 

According to NASA's latest update, the Mars Curiosity Rover has left the Vera Rubin Ridge and descended toward a clay Region of Mount Sharp, a 5.5 kilometers tall mountain in Mars. 

The rover will be exploring the mountain's clay-bearing unit at the south of the Vera Rubin Ridge. The mission team believes the minerals in this area will help them understand lake formations that contributed to the shape of the lower levels of Mount Sharp.

As of December 2018, the Curiosity Rover has drilled and collected nineteen samples of Martian sediments. The latest sample was collected in an area of the Vera Rubin Ridge called Rock Hall.

Curiosity first landed on Mars in August 2012 and has since been snapping selfies and collecting data to complete its main mission: finding out if Mars could host microbial life and determine whether or not there ever were forms of life on the Red Planet.

New Atlas reports NASA's second rover on the Red Planet, Opportunity, lost contact with its team after a global sand storm blocked out the sun for several days in May 2018. Opportunity is powered by solar power and the lack of sunlight forced the rover to shut down after its batteries were drained.

NASA has since tried to contact Opportunity over 600 times using various radio commands to no avail. 3776572]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[NASA maps black hole 10 times larger than our sun 3776487]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — NASA's newest project is on a mission to understand black holes. 

Black holes are the giant light-sucking space monsters that usually play the villain in sci-fi movies. But they are still widely misunderstood.

NASA is hoping to change that with their new NICER mission.

Currently, researchers are studying light echoes surrounding a black hole 10,000 light years away from Earth. NASA reports that the stellar-mass black hole is called MAXI J1820+070, or J1820, and it's currently absorbing material from a nearby star. The black hole is 10 times larger than our sun.

J1820 hadn't been in NASA's radar until May 2018, when Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency's Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image investigation detected an outburst of light emanating from the black hole.

J1820's sudden outburst allowed NASA to examine how the corona and disk of the black hole changes as it consumes material from the neighboring star.

Using a tool called the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, or NICER, researchers were able to observe light echoes of x-ray light bouncing off the swirling gas near J1820 that was changing the black hole's environment size and shape.

Let us explain where these x-ray lights come from and why they matter.

Black holes can act like giant funnels, absorbing materials from nearby stars into a ring called an accretion disk, which is the gas and materials surrounding black holes.

The accretion disc is incredibly hot. Its heat allows it to create x-rays in the areas closer to the black hole. Fluctuations and movement in the disc can cause outbursts.

The corona is an even hotter region of subatomic particles that emit higher-energy x-rays.

Since J1820's outburst, researchers found another anomaly. Its corona had shrunk from 160 kilometers to just 16 kilometers. Although the origin of the x-ray lights can be explained, the cause of the sudden outburst and fluctuations still remain a mystery.

Using NICER, NASA can observe these lights and study them to understand why black holes behave the way they do. 3776487]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Mini pig craze leads to growing number of pigs at shelters 3777205]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS LUNAS, NEW MEXICO — KRQE reports that animal rescues and shelters are seeing an influx of abandoned pet pigs, who are advertised as mini, but don't really stay that way for long.

This is reportedly due to the so-called 'mini pig craze' that's become all the rage the last few years, after celebs like Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus got them as pets.

The only problem is that there's no such thing as mini, teacup, micro, or pocket pigs. It's all just false advertising, according to Betheny Foster of New Mexico's Hippie Pig Sanctuary.

Those cute little oinkers may be small enough to fit a teacup now, but like all piglets, they will eventually grow up to be full-sized pigs. The only way to keep them small, according to Foster, is to starve them.

According to KSNV, the pigs grow up to about 150 to 200 pounds, and are often abandoned by their misinformed owners once they become too big to handle.

The Animal Foundation in Las Vegas says most of the ones they get are strays that are brought in by animal control.

While pigs are intelligent animals and can make really great companions, people really ought to be doing homework to know what they're getting themselves into.

Shelters do adopt out pigs, but most put adoptees through a lengthy process to make sure little porky goes to a good home, and not end up as bacon or pork chops. 3777205]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BAY OF ISLANDS, NEW ZEALAND — A grieving dolphin was spotted carrying its dead calf by New Zealand's Department of Conservation. 
  
To the untrained eye, this image looks like a tender moment between a mama dolphin and her baby, but if only that were the case but the photo shows a grieving bottlenose dolphin carrying her dead baby calf. 

The Department of Conservation spotted the dolphin in the waters around the Bay of Islands. They watched the mother drop her calf but circle back to pick it up, showing clear signs of maternal bonding and grieving.

They've also shared a photo and a caution on their Twitter account, asking people living in that area to give her the space she needs to grieve.

This kind of behavior is not uncommon among cetaceans. According to online science magazine Cosmos Magazine, dolphins account for 92.3 percent of grieving behaviors among cetaceans. The report shows that 75 percent of these grieving behaviors among dolphins were shown as female dolphins mourning their calves.

Grieving is common in the animal kingdom. Orcas are also known to carry their dead infants and elephants visit the body of a deceased member of their community days after its death and even scatter their bones 3777203]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[New website shows Apple's censored China apps 3776976]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING —  A new website has developed a search engine specifically to expose which apps have been blocked by Apple's App Store in China, reports The Intercept. 

AppleCensorship.com is a website that monitors censorship in over 150 iOS App Stores. The website was created by a Chinese non-profit organization called GreatFire.org. This organization is dedicated to monitoring China's Internet censorship and creating tools to fight against it.

They have developed apps like FreeBrowser and FreeBooks which lets users access uncensored books and news in China along with other websites promoting freedom of speech.

Their newest website comes as a response to Apple's 'collaboration' with China. In 2017, the tech giant removed more than 600 virtual private network apps that allow users to browse the web without being under the eye of Big Brother. 

In an interview with The Intercept, GreatFire.org co-founder, Charlie Smith said that the 'top 100 VPN apps in the U.S. app store are all not available in the China app store.' Not surprising.

Currently, Apple has also blocked apps from media outlets including the New York Times, Tibetan News and Voice of Tibet. They have also blocked Bitter Winter, an application that shares news about religious freedom in China and another app managed by the Central Tibetan Authority.

Smith also commented on Apple 's role in censorship in China stating, 'Apple provides little transparency into what it censors in its app store. Most developers find out their app has been censored after they see a drop in China traffic and try to figure out if there is a problem. We wanted to bring transparency to what they are censoring.' 3776976]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco has been designing a system over the past two years to track every homeless person in the city, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. 
The goal of the digital program called ONE System is to collect and sort information in order to tailor housing needs, rehabilitation and other services in order to cut down on costly, wasteful duplication efforts. 
According to Bloomberg, the $5 million 50-employee pilot program began in August.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, by typing in a homeless person's name, information about every health, housing, jail and counseling program that person has ever been involved in will come up instantly. 
ONE System was designed by Nevada startup BitFocus Inc., and collects data from 15 city and state agencies, according to Bloomberg.  
Participants are asked 17 questions that help determine their individual situation, including time spent on the street, health and vulnerability. 
The program has so far signed up around 1,000 people, with the goal of registering 2,000 by the end of October. The city's homeless count currently sits at 7,499, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. 
However, in the five months since the program started, only 20 people have been placed in permanent housing, and 50 more have been helped off the streets through counseling and contact with family and friends. 3777611]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China using AI in 'Zero Trust' system to spot corruption 3777569]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — China has developed an anti-corruption AI system called Zero Trust to help identify corrupt public officials. 
According to the SCMP, it was developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Communist Party's internal control institutions to monitor, evaluate or intervene in the work and personal life of public servants. 
Zero Trust can cross-reference more than 150 protected databases in central and local governments systems, reports the SCMP. 
The system is designed to detect property transfers, infrastructure construction, land purchases and house demolitions, according to one researcher involved with the program, according the SCMP. 
Researchers built the system to detect unusual increases in bank savings, new car purchases or bidding for government contracts under the name of the official or one of his or her family or friends.
The system then calculates a probability for those actions to be corrupt and if authorities need to be alerted. 

According to the SCMP, Zero Trust was only rolled out in 30 counties and cities, but managed to catch 8,721 government officials engaging in embezzlement, abuse of power, misuse of government funds and nepotism. 
Only some were sentence to jail time, with most being allowed to keep their jobs after a warning or minor punishment. 3777569]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GENOA, ITALY — The city of Genoa is ready to start rebuilding five months after the collapse of the 50-year-old Morandi Bridge, reports Italian news site ANSA.

The Morandi Bridge collapsed on August 15, 2018. The bridge failure may have been caused by a collapsed stay. The remaining parts of the bridge will be demolished and removed between February 6 and 8.

Engineering.com reports that the new bridge will be built with weight bearing columns instead of the A-frame, cable-stayed design of the previous bridge.

Renzo Piano is the architect behind the design of the new bridge. He is also the architect behind The Shard in London and the Whitney Museum in New York. Piano is Genoese and has designed the bridge free of charge, calling it an act of 'civic spirit.'

The new steel bridge will measure 1,100 meters in length. Its deck will be supported by reinforced concrete beams positioned at 50-meter increments. The bridge is set to be completed in 12 months once construction begins. 3777558]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — China has been testing a new hypersonic railgun.

CNBC reports that China's newest railgun uses electromagnetic energy to fire rounds and is capable of hitting targets 200 kilometers away traveling at 2.5 kilometers per second. That's seven times the speed of sound.

According to CNBC, a missile traveling at that speed would take just 90 seconds to travel from Washington to Philadelphia. 

Xinhua News reported that China may be mounting the railgun on a Type 055 destroyer. 

The Type 055 is Asia's largest destroyer to date, measuring 180 meters long and 20 meters wide. It's equipped with anti-missile, anti-ship and anti-submarine weapons. It's equipped to power kinetic energy weapons.

CNBC reports that information from a U.S. intelligence report reveals that China is expected to introduce its new weapon to its arsenal in 2025. 3777555]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING  —  During this year's Lunar New Year, China will be eating lean meat from pigs that look like they've been pumping iron, reports The Sun. 

Pigs are known for being adorably chubby but in China eating fat piggies is no longer in fashion.

According to the journal Nature, these super lean pigs were first bred by a team of Chinese and South Korean biologists back in 2015.

The team used genetic-editing technology to create these super-muscular porkies in record time. Usually, animals would have to go through years of selective breeding to achieve the same results.

Demand for leaner pork is on the rise in China while local hog breeds are disappearing. According to the SCMP, the shift in preference for leaner meats has led to Western pig breeds to become more popular and caused the decline of indigenous breeds.

Local breeds including the Jinhua and Chenghua pigs which are staples of local dishes have been depleted. 3777549]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Harmful chemicals found in disposable diapers in France 3777517]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[FRANCE — An investigative report has found traces of harmful chemicals in disposable baby diapers in France.

A total of 23 different samples of diapers sold between 2016 and 2018 in France were tested by researchers for toxic chemicals, according to the Safety in Baby Nappies report.

As many as 60 different chemicals such as glyphosate, dioxins and PCB-126 were found in the diapers, according to Chemical Watch.
 
Some of these chemicals are banned in the European Union, according to the Guardian.

Anses, the French Agency for food, environmental and occupational health and safety, is cited by the Guardian as saying some chemicals, such as perfume, were purposefully added to the diapers.

The report did not specify which diaper brands were found to be have toxic chemicals.

Diaper manufacturers were quick to react to the report with Pampers saying their diapers are safe and always have been.

Joone responded by saying the report is alarming and explained that the company had previously published toxicology analysis for its products.

Reuters quotes French health Minister Agnes Buzyn, as saying there is no immediate, serious risk for the health of the child, but it is paramount to take precautions.

French Environment Minister Francois de Rugy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire issued a joint statement urging manufacturers to come up with a plan to remove the toxic chemicals from the diapers in the next 15 days, Reuters reports. 3777517]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HANGZHOU, CHINA — Apparently a new trend that will probably make you give up food all together is sweeping across some parts of China—hot pot-esque hot springs.
According to the Lonely Planet, guests staying at the First World Hotel in Hangzhou can have a dip in one of the hotel's hot springs that's been made to look like a human-sized hot pot. 
The human hot pot is split up into nine different squares, each filled with a different ingredient.  
The guests are then invited to strip down and hop into the broth. They are then treated to some lame skewers to nibble on and drinks. Seems like a whole lot of work to just eat some skewers. 
Apparently, the hotel thinks human hot pots somehow promote a healthy lifestyle.
What better way to promote a healthy lifestyle then by wasting food people won't eat by bathing in it in a country that has 1.3 billion people—genius. 
Well—it is the year of the pig. 3777479]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA — WFMY reports that a student from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro found a man hiding in her closet, wearing her clothes.

The student, identified only as Maddie, told Fox 8 she noticed clothes going missing, and saw handprints left on the bathroom wall. The running joke with her roommate was that they had a ghost in the house.

Turns out it was way worse.

On Saturday, Maddie began hearing rattling in the closet that sounded like there was a raccoon inside. She went to the closet door and asked Who's in there?, only to be gobsmacked when a guy named Drew answered back. 

According to WFMY, Maddie tried to make an emergency call on her Apple Watch but failed. She eventually opened the door and found the dude sitting on the floor in her clothes. He even had a book bag filled with her stuff.

Maddie talked to the guy to keep him distracted while texting her boyfriend photos to keep him up to speed. Dude hightailed it outta there when the boyfriend showed up, and was arrested at a nearby gas station.

Police later identified the man as 30-year-old Andrew Clyde Swofford, and charged him with misdemeanor breaking and entering.

Maddie and her roommate, meanwhile, are freaked out enough to move out ASAP, now that they don't feel safe in their own home. 3777970]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Inkjet printed solar panels could revolutionize green energy 3777945]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WARSAW, POLAND — AFP reports that a novel processing method has been developed that allows for the production of solar panels at lower temperatures and reduced costs.

In 2009, it was discovered that the perovskite class of minerals could be used to form photovoltaic solar cells. But the initial process was complicated, and could only be done on materials like glass that could withstand the extreme heat required.

Polish physicist Olga Malinkiewicz eventually found a way to coat flexible foil with perovskites, and later developed an inkjet printing method that required no high heat.

The perovskite-coated solar panels are flexible, and can be easily affixed to laptops, cars, drones, spacecrafts, and buildings to allow them to produce electricity, even in the shade or indoors.

According to current estimates, a standard 1.3 square meter panel can supply a day's worth of energy to an office workstation. The projected cost of the panel is $57.

Malinkiewicz claims the initial cost of the inkjet panels will be comparable to conventional ones.

Her company, Saule Technologies, partnered with Swedish construction firm Skanska, which will incorporate the solar cell technology in its projects across the globe.

Experts say perovskite technology could revolutionise access to solar power for all, as it has the potential to address the world energy poverty. 3777945]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA — CNBC reports that Facebook's Messenger app is now letting users delete texts after they've been sent- finally!

It's a miracle we've managed to live all this time without an unsend feature, but fortunately, those dark days are over!

According to a Facebook press release, users with post-text regret need only tap a message and select Remove from Everyone. This replaces the message with an notification that it's been removed.

However, you can only do it within 10 minutes of sending.

Wired reports that folks who like decluttering their chats can use the Remove for You option to take out certain texts and leave only the ones that spark joy. Fortunately, this one doesn't have a time limit.

Facebook had promised users the feature months ago, after a TechCrunch report revealed Mark Zuckerberg's messages were removed from recipients' inboxes, supposedly for security purposes.

The social media giant says the remove message feature is now available on the latest version of Messenger, both for iOS and Android.

Now if only all the other social media apps can get on the bandwagon. 3777941]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[COLUMBUS, OHIO — According to Ohio State University astrophysicist Paul Sutter on Live Science, physicists are interested in studying the mysterious top quark, and it may have to do with its connection to the god particle.

According to CERN, quarks are subatomic particles that are the building blocks of matter. There are six types: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom.

Up and down quarks, which are the most common, and group together to form protons and neutrons. The quarks have fractional charges, which add up to become the positive proton and neutral neutron charges.

Charm and strange have a fleeting existence according to Symmetry Magazine, as they're unstable particles that easily decay into conventional particles.

The six quarks differ in size and weight, with up and down quarks being the lightest, followed by charm and strange, and then bottom quarks. Top quarks are the largest - about 100 trillion times heavier than up quarks.

This wide range in masses is believed to be due to the Higgs field. According to CERN, particles acquire a mass by interacting with this invisible field, whose visible manifestation is the Higgs boson particle. The more a particle interacts, the heavier it is.

Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider reveal that the Higgs boson interacts strongly with the top quark.

Physicists believe that by studying its coupling with top quarks, more can be learned about the properties of the Higgs boson. It might even lead to the discovery of heavy new-physics particles. 3777870]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[KIEL, GERMANY — A Dutch firm has been chosen to build a jenga-like building project in northern Germany, according to Inhabitat.

Dutch firm MVRDV plans to build a 65,000-square-meter city block called Koolkiel in northern Germany. The project would consist of a Jenga-like architecture, reports Inhabitat.

The main building's exterior would feature facade panels made from fibre reinforced concrete, according to the company's website.

The flexible design of the complex will give the community the freedom to modify the structure's interior and exterior, according to Inhabitat.

The project would also be equipped with rooftop solar panels, green roofs and other energy-saving features, Inhabitat reports.

The entire complex itself would be a mix of residential and commercial buildings with apartments on top, according to Inhabitat.

MVRDV has yet to announce a completion date for the project. 3777804]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Stem cell research: Scientists grow kidneys in rats 3778540]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NAGOYA, JAPAN —  Researchers successfully grew kidneys in rats by implanting stem cells from mice, according to the journal Nature Communications. 

Researchers selected rat embryos that were genetically modified to not develop kidneys and injected them with stem cells from mice.

These embryos were then implanted into the womb of rats that would carry the pregnancy to term. The rats successfully grew kidneys. 

However, genetically modifying their genes to not grow their own kidneys caused them to lose their sense of smell. Due to this alteration, they did not suckle properly and died shortly after birth. This made it hard for scientists to study the effectiveness of the kidneys they developed.

Another concern is that growing organs from another species would eventually lead to organ contamination in the cells of the host.

This technology could eventually lead to growing human organs in other animals.

However, the paper's research supervisor Masumi Hirabayashi stated that this poses a larger ethical concern. This is because injecting human stem cells into animals could cause them to develop consciousness and reproductive cells. 3778540]]></video:description>

$190 million locked away 3778537]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA —  A cryptocurrency exchange company is struggling after its CEO died leaving $190 million locked in his encrypted laptop, reports NPR.

Gerald Cotten was the sole director of Quadriga, Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange and his sudden death has left the company struggling to refund its over 100,000 users.

Cotten's widow, Jennifer Robertson, has been left to clean up the financial mess that ensued after his death. There's only one problem: she doesn't know the password or recovery key to access the computer Cotten used to store the company's crypto funds.

Robertson has since hired experts to break into his laptop and cellphone but they have only been able to gain limited access. The company has filed for bankruptcy protection as it tries to find ways to recover the passwords or refund its users.

And, because this happened in the internet world, conspiracy theories questioning Cotten's death have began popping up.

According to statements issued by his widow on Quadriga's site, Cotten died due to complications with Crohn's disease in Jaipur, India where he was opening an orphanage.

Blockchain news site, Coin Desk retrieved and published Cotten's death certificate but it has raised even more questions as it does not share a cause of death.

Reddit users heavily questioned the legitimacy of Cotten's death certificate with some flat out saying it was definitely staged claiming that forging a death certificate in India isn't too difficult. 3778537]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MORRO BAY, CALIFORNIA — A lost baby otter is back at home after being spotted by a commercial fisherman in the waters off Morro Bay, according to the city of Morro Bay in a Facebook post. 
According to the San Luis Obispo Tribune, the fisherman got in touch with the Morro Bay Harbor Patrol, who contacted environmental scientist Mike Harris of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
Harris then joined other officials who found the pup. According to Harris in a phone interview with the paper, the female baby was about 2 days old. 
When mothers gets separated from their pups, they cry out to find one another. The team recorded the pup's cries and then went around the bay playing it with a wireless speaker. 

They eventually located the mother in a group of otters by the South T Pier, close to a mile away from where the pup was discovered. 
The little girl gets gently tossed back into the water by her mother, who at first dives out of sight. 
After a few nerve-racking seconds, the mother comes back up underneath her baby and the family is reunited. 3778534]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Scientists propose new idea to explain Alzheimer's 3778532]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO — Researchers have identified a specific blood-clotting protein that can trigger synaptic damage after leaking into the brain, according to New Atlas. 
A new study published in the journal Neuron finds the protein fibrinogen can be found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease and experimental lab mice. 
According to New Atlas, scientists found that when fibrinogen enters the brain through blood-brain barrier leaks, it triggers inflammation that can damage neuron synapses. 
The team found that fibrinogen can cause synaptic damage in the absence of any amyloid plaque build-up. 
Other studies have proposed that an increasingly permeable blood-brain barrier may allow more toxic amyloid and tau proteins to enter the brain, starting the pathological process that leads to Alzheimer's. This new study could provide an alternative explanation. 
While tests on animals have been conducted, the findings have yet to lead to human clinical trials. 
According to the researchers, the type of synaptic damage associated with blood-brain barrier breakdowns could play a role in various neurological conditions. 3778532]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA — The CBC reports that a Canadian man with a very unique last name has gotten his request for a personalized license plate denied.

Saskatchewan railroad worker David Assman- that's A-S-S-M-A-N- has been trying and failing to get his name on a license plate since the 90s.

According to the National Post, the surname was rejected as profanity, with the most recent application denied on the grounds that is was offensive, suggestive, and not in good taste.

Dave told CBC he's not ashamed of his name. It's German and has absolutely nothing to do with heinies.

Still, it's not like people are gonna see A-S-S-M-A-N on a plate and think that.

Saskatchewan Government Insurance, which reviews vanity license plates requests, says they must abide by guidelines even if a word is someone's name, and pronounced differently than the offensive version.

The National Post reports that SGI has rejected similarly problematic names like MR WOOD and even MEAT, so it's really nothing personal.

And even though Assman still wants his personalized plate, he's not holding his breath. 3778405]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA / NORWAY — Hackers working for Chinese intelligence broke into Norwegian software firm Visma's network to steal private information from its customers, Reuters reports.

An investigative report by the Insikt Group and Rapid7 at Recorded Future claims that, Chinese cyber espionage group APT 10 was able to access the Norwegian firm's networks by using stolen credentials.

The hackers reportedly used a remote access trojan variant to access steal the credentials. This is said to have downloaded three files onto the target's computer to run the malware.

APT 10 was able to compress and exfiltrate the user data using Dropbox, according to the report.

China had previously hacked IBM and Hewlett Packard through its hacking campaign, Cloudhopper in 2017, according to Reuters.

Espen Johansen, Visma's operations and security manager said they discovered the hack soon after it happened. He said he was confident no client networks were accessed. 3778247]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES — New research has shed light on how seemingly harmless silent strokes caused by Sickle Cell Disease can affect our body's daily functions, reports Medical Express. 

According to the CDC, SCD is a disorder that affects hemoglobin, a molecule present in red blood cells in charge of delivering oxygen throughout the body. Blood cells affected by SCD have an irregular crescent shape and also supply a reduced amount of oxygen to the body.

A new study published in the American Journal of Hematology studied the effects of limited oxygen and blood flow caused by sickle cell disease. Particularly, its role in silent strokes among sickle cell patients.

Silent strokes occur when there has been an interruption of blood flow in an area of the brain that is not vital. However, as they accumulate they can damage brain function.

Using an advanced imaging technique called arterial spin labeling, researchers found that oxygen delivery to regions of the brain where white matter was present was reduced by 35 percent in patients with SCD. Most silent strokes occur in regions of the brain with white matter. 

The results show that the body prioritizes blood flow to grey matter where neurons are present.
 
A stroke in grey matter could cause severe and permanent damage while a stroke in white matter causes slow information processing in the brain without severe immediate consequences. 3778206]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHICAGO — A NASA-funded start-up is using fermentation technology to create lab-grown protein.  

Eating meat is killing our environment, but getting everyone to give it up is kind of like mission impossible. This is why alt-meat start-ups have come up with all kinds of ways to create an alternative source of protein that doesn't involve exploiting the land for farming and livestock.

According to Bloomberg, biotech start-up Sustainable Bioproducts is trying to replicate behavior from volcanic microbes found in hot springs at Yellowstone National Park to create lab-grown protein.

The company has been able to grow protein using fermentation technology. Researchers feed starch and glycerin to the high-protein microbes, which react by multiplying quickly. 

The resulting protein contains nine key amino acids that are essential for the human diet. The substance can be used to create a meat-like product, mixed to make yogurt or shaped into a plant-based burger patty.

According to Food Dive, the NASA-funded company recently received $33 million dollars in Series A funding. Investors include  Microsoft's Bill Gates, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Bloomberg's Michael Bloomberg and Virgin Group's Richard Branson. 3778198]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM — A woman in Bristol has come up with a way to stop herself from making any more bad life choices — by paying someone else to do it for her.

The unnamed lady posted an odd job request on Bark.com looking for a clairvoyant or spiritual guide to decide her choices for a month. The payoff? A pretty sweet £2,000 or $2,600 for a month's worth of decision-making, according to her ad.

She claims she has a history of making terrible decisions. In the past year alone, she's lost money she loaned to a friend, got stranded penniless while backpacking in New Zealand, and was in an abusive relationship for half a year before getting dumped.

She also got mugged while cutting through a shady area, and is convinced she's incapable of making the right decisions.

According to the ad, the lucky candidate will need to be on-call, presumably 24/7, so they can help her with anything and everything, from who to go on a Tinder date with, to what to spend her savings on.

Since she messages a lot, whoever it is needs to be available to message back, and quickly.

Bark co-founder Kai Feller said in an article on the company's blog that though the idea is a bit strange, it's surprising that such a request hadn't come sooner. He likened it to a financial adviser managing people's finances.

Sure, but with this lady's tendency to make bad choices, who's to say getting a life adviser is a good call? 3779675]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Google complying with Russian government censorship requests 3779664]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MOUNTAINVIEW, CALIFORNIA —  Google is complying with Russian government censorship, accodrding to BuzzFeed News.

Russia, a country listed as 'Not Free' by Freedom House, has asked Google to block a list of sites from their search engine. According to reports, the tech giant has complied. 

Russia's state media oversight agency has demanded that Google not show results for porn, drugs, pirated media, political extremism, and other topics. Russia is also said to have asked Google to block an ongoing corruption investigation of a Russian government official, according to the Moscow Times.

Russian business newspaper called Vedemosti alleges that Google has already deleted 70 percent of the websites on the country's blacklist. This is not the first time Google has removed sites at the request of Russia.

According to data from Google's transparency reports, they have already taken down  80 percent of over 160,000 different URLs reported by Russia. The report also shows that Russia has requested a total of 232,583 items for removal.

TomoNews reached out to Google for comment on the reports, however, they didn't get back to us by press time.

Last week they told BuzzFeed News via email, We're committed to enabling access to information for the benefit of our users in Russia and around the world. 

Google has had a tough time managing censorship, especially in countries like Russia and China.

In late 2018, Google's plans of developing a censored search engine for China called Dragonfly became public. The search engine would blacklist information on human rights, activism, democracy and many more topics that are a no-no in China.

The plans were not well received. According to The Intercept, in January human rights groups stood outside Google offices in the U.S., U.K., Sweden, Denmark and other countries in protest. 3779664]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SOUTH KOREA — Spanish firm Wavegarden has started construction on the world's largest surfing lagoon in South Korea. 

The company is collaborating with Daewon Plus Construction on the project, according to a press release by Wavegarden.

The lagoon, called Wavegarden Cove, will be featured on Turtle Island, a manmade island built from land reclaimed from the sea. It will be part of the new Turtle Island attraction which is said to be worth around US$2.4 billion.

The lagoon will reportedly be able to produce 1000 ocean-like waves per hour across its different surfing areas. Activities such as kayaking and swimming will also be available.

According to a Wavegarden press release, different facilities such as hotels, convention centers and marinas will also be included in the island. 

Turtle Island is all set to open to the public by 2020. 3779442]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Bacteria found to absorb antibiotics to protect their colony 3779353]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA — A new study has found that bacteria sacrifice themselves to antibiotics in order to preserve their colony.

Researchers at California State University and Princeton exposed a colony of E.Coli to a molecule known as LL37, according to the journal E Life.

The molecule was slightly modified to give off a green glow that would allow researchers to track its movement.

LL37 is a natural antibiotic produced by the skin and some organs in the body to help eliminate foreign bacteria, according to the study.

The scientists found that only a tiny amount of E.Coli bacteria were needed to absorb large amounts of LL37. E.Coli cells that consumed the molecule were reportedly killed. 

However, this allowed the rest of the bacteria colony to keep on growing and spreading.

Sattar Taheri-Araghi, a co-senior author of the study said that their findings have profound implications for the evolution of bacteria. 3779353]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM — A new study of two large groups of Europeans has found several types of gut bacteria are missing in people with depression, according to Science Magazine. 
The scientists could not say whether the absence is a cause or an effect of the illness, but were able to show that many gut bacteria could produce substances that affect nerve cell function and possibly mood. The results were published in the journal Nature Microbiology. 
To test the link between the microbiome and depression, Jeroen Raes, a microbiologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, and his team looked at 1054 Belgians to assess a normal microbiome. 
Within the group, 173 people had been diagnosed with depression or done poorly on a quality of life survey. The gut microbes of depressed group was then compared to the normal group. 
Two types of bacteria, Coprococcus and Dialister, were absent from the guts of depressed participants. 
The team then looked at the microbiomes of 1064 Dutch participants and also found the same two species were missing in people who were depressed. 
It is still unclear how the gut microbiome affects the brain. One possible avenue is through the vagus nerve, which connects the gut and the brain. 
But with more studies, scientists hope the microbiome-brain connection could eventually lead to novel therapies for treating depression. 3780079]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MIAMI — A 20-year-old Chinese student is going to have to spend a year in the slammer for taking photos inside a U.S. naval base in the Florida Keys. 
According to CBS Miami, Zhao Qianli was sentenced to a year in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to illegally taking pictures at a key US defence intelligence facility in Florida. 
According to court documents, Zhao entered the Joint Interagency Task Force South military installation, located at Naval Air Station Key West on September 26 without permission by circumnavigating the installation's primary fence line, and entering the military property from the beach.
Agent double O, not quite 7 then went directly to an area containing satellite dishes and antennas called the Farm where he took videos and several pictures, according to the documents. 
The court documents also said the Farm area was clearly marked with RESTRICTED AREA and KEEP OUT signs. 

According to CBS Miami, the court papers give no specific indication whether Zhao was trying to commit espionage. Hey—if it looks like a duck.  
According to CNN affiliate WFOR, Zhao was supposedly in the U.S. for a summer exchange program from North University of China to study musicology. 
Well—on the bright side, Zhao will now get to study the inside of a federal penitentiary. 3780074]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TOKYO — Japan is preparing for next year's Olympics by asking the public to donate electronic devices they no longer use, according to New Atlas.

Japan's Organizing Committee for the 2020 Olympics has been collecting used smartphones, digital cameras and laptops since April 2018 to convert the devices' metals into medals.

Recycle centers were set up across the country, resulting in more than 47,000 tons of electronic devices being collected, according to New Atlas.

Information from the official Tokyo 2020 website notes that the committee has already met its target goal for bronze medals — 2,700 kg. Around 28.4 kg of the targeted 30.3 kg has been extracted for the gold medal. While 3,500 kg of the targeted 4,100 kg of silver has been extracted from the recycled waste.

      <video:title><![CDATA[Chimps use branch as ladder to escape Belfast Zoo enclosure 3779956]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BELFAST, UNITED KINGDOM — The Belfast Telegraph reports that a couple of naughty chimps broke out of their enclosure at the Belfast Zoo and scared the bejesus out of several visitors.

The clever primates staged the escape in broad daylight, using a tree branch as a makeshift ladder to scale the high walls of their enclosure.

While most chose to just hang out on the enclosure walls, at least one mischievous monkey was spotted sauntering outside, to the shock of zoo goers.

Luckily, the animals were quite chill, and didn't get aggressive with anyone.

Belfast Zoo manager Alyne Cairns told the BBC the chimps were quite cowardly  and knew they weren't supposed to be out. 

The cheeky chimps went back into their enclosures themselves, and were later locked in the inner enclosure for their shenanigans.

According to The Guardian, zookeepers believe trees in the chimpanzee enclosure had been weakened by recent storms, which made it easier for the animals to break them off.

The chimps may have taken pointers from Amber the red panda cub, who snuck out last month following an electric fence failure. She was eventually found in a garden less than a mile from the zoo. 3779956]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[JAPAN — Japan's Hayabusa 2 spacecraft is scheduled to collect rock samples from the asteroid Ryugu on February 22.

The spacecraft will fire a 5 gram projectile made of metal tantalum onto the asteroid's surface while touching down, according to the BBC.

The particles that fly up will then be collected by the spacecraft's sampler horn as Hayabusa 2 descends onto the asteroid's surface.

The scientists involved believe the samples will provide insight into the evolution and origin of the Earth as Ryugu is believed to be an ancient asteroid.

Hayabusa 2 had previously deployed two rovers that explored Ryugu's surface. They sent back images and data of the asteroid to Earth.

The spacecraft is expected to return to Earth with the samples in 2020. 3779939]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — The UK's new aircraft carrier will be deployed to the Pacific on its first mission, in a show of hard power and lethality meant to support the country's global interests.

In a speech at the Royal United Services Institute, British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier will go to the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and the Pacific region on its first operational mission.

CNN reports that the 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth was commissioned in 2017 and has a ski-jump flight deck. It's expected to be the centerpiece of the British Navy once it enters service in 2020.

British and American F-35 fighter jets will reportedly be embedded in the air wing of the carrier, which Williamson says will enhance the reach and lethality of our forces while reinforcing the U.S. as a close partner.

Williamson's speech came on the same day the U.S. sailed two Navy warships near the Mischief Reef in the Spratlys to challenge Beijing's territorial claims.

This prompted Chinese foreign ministry to issue a sharp rebuke telling the U.S. to stop provocative actions that violate China's sovereignty.

The South China Morning Post reports that Britain has repeatedly stated intentions to increase activity abroad, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to build a naval base in either Singapore or Brunei.

During his recent speech, Williamson also mentioned a plan to develop a squadron of network-enabled drones that can confuse and overwhelm enemy air defences. 3780901]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SOUTH LYON, MICHIGAN — A 54-year-old man has passed away after falling into a tank of sulfuric acid in Michigan, according to The Oakland Press.

The incident reportedly took place on Saturday at Michigan Seamless Tube. The company uses sulfuric acid with temperatures of up to 160 degrees for manufacturing.

The man ended up falling into the tank of sulfuric acid while at work. However, it's not clear how it happened, the Detroit Free Press reports. He is said to be have been pulled out of the tank by his co-workers and immediately washed off, according to WWJ News Radio.

The 54-four-year old was rushed by ambulance to the University of Michigan Hospital. Unfortunately, the man didn't make it.

South Lyon Police Chief Chris Sovik told WWJ News Radio, quote We don't believe there was any foul play or criminal matter to investigate.

The Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration or MIOSHA, will conduct their own investigation of what happened, taking over from the police.

The company also released a statement describing the event as a very serious industrial accident. They plan to conduct an internal investigation while working with MIOSHA. 3780779]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[KATHMANDU, NEPAL — One-third of the glaciers from the peaceful Himalayas will melt off by 2100 and a recent report shows that not even immediate climate change actions can save them, reports The Guardian. 

Glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region span eight countries and are an important geo-ecological asset. They are the origin of 10 major river basins and sustain the lives of 1.65 billion people. 

A new report called The Hindu Kush-Himalaya Assessment predicts that 36 percent of the glaciers located in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush range will be gone by 2100 even if carbon emissions are slashed to zero by 2050.

Even if the global rise in temperature is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, 50 percent of the glaciers would disappear by 2100. The report predicts that in 2050 and 2060 river flow will increase possibly causing glacial lake outburst floods in surrounding communities.

The Hindu Kush Himalayan range has already lost roughly 15 percent of its ice since the 1970s.

Sherab Lama, a Nepalese Buddhist monk told NPR people that from his village are scared saying, 'They say, 'I don't know what will happen after two to three generations.' They are very worried. I am very worried.' 3780609]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA — Google and Apple are under fire for hosting an app from the Saudi government that allows men to monitor women under their 'guardianship', reports This Is Insider.

The app in question is called Absher. It works as an e-service portal for the Saudi Interior Ministry. Users can use the app to pay traffic fines and renew their licenses remotely.

Saudi men can also use this app to track their wives and unmarried daughter's. Men can log travel information of women in their family and use it the app to track their every step. 

Under Saudi Arabia's archaic 'guardianship system' women are not allowed to apply for any travel documents without the approval of a male guardian — let alone travel outside the country by themselves. Guardians are typically their husbands, or for the unmarried, their fathers.

The app facilitates that. Men can choose to receive SMS texts every time a woman under their guardianship uses their passport at an airport check-in or crosses a border. 
Guardians also get a clear log of any of their so-called dependents and they can cancel a woman's travel paper remotely through the app.

Once a woman is registered in the Absher system it becomes near impossible for them to escape.

Most recently, the world had their eyes on Rahaf Mohammed, an eighteen-year-old who was granted asylum in Canada after escaping from a family vacation in Kuwait.

Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden has tweeted out and sent an open letter to both Google and Apple urging them to take down the app from their stores immediately. In his letter, he wrote, American companies should not enable or facilitate the Saudi government's patriarchy. 

About 1,000 women escape Saudi Arabia each year. 3780559]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Reddit takes Tencent cash, sparks user backlash 3780536]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO — Last week reports came out Chinese tech monstrosity Tencent would be investing $150 million in Reddit. 

China—for those who have been living under a rock—has the greatest internet. The only problem? It doesn't actually connect to the outside world and comes with just a pinch of censorship. 
By opening the doors to Chinese money, Reddit basically killed its own karma. 

According to the BBC, the proposed selling out prompted swift backlash from users who still see the site as a bastion of free speech. 
It's unlikely that Tencent will be able to make any decisions as to the type of content that is posted on the site, but that hasn't stopped hilarious memes and protest messages from exploding all over the platform. 

In China, any mention of Taiwan, Tibet, Tiananmen Square and Winnie the Pooh over their INTRANET is a no no. 
So naturally, Reddit users have been plastering the site with posts mentioning Taiwan, Tibet, Tiananmen Square and Winnie the Pooh and up voting the hell out of them.  

Reddit is thought to be valued at around $2.7 billion, so $150 million is far from total control. 
Chinese money might not come with strings attached, but that's only because they're built in. 3780536]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[What happens if Trump declares an emergency to build his wall? 3780494]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has hinted that he might declare a state of emergency to bypass Congress and get funding for his wall, just days before the February 15 deadline.

The Atlantic reports that under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, President Trump can declare a national emergency along the southern border, and have access to specific powers that Congress has already codified by law.

A U.S. government official told CNN, the administration could pull: $681 million from Treasury forfeiture funds, $3.6 billion in military construction, $3 billion in Pentagon civil works funds, and $200 million in Department of Homeland Security funds.

So funds originally intended for projects like military housing or civil infrastructure repair would now be reallocated for wall construction. According to Vox, Trump could also unlock a $20 million immigration emergency fund that's meant to be used by states to feed and house migrants.

CNN reports that if the emergency declaration is made, the Army Corps of Engineers would then be deployed to build the wall.

Private property on which some portions of the wall will be built can be seized by the administration since it will be for public use. Internal White House documents reviewed by CNN indicates that environmental reviews can be skipped, and Homeland Security can use waivers to bypass contracting laws.

Congress can override the declaration with a simple majority vote, but if the President were to veto, they will need a supermajority or two-thirds vote in both chambers to override it.

Though it's unclear at the moment if Trump really means to declare an emergency or is just issuing empty threats, we wouldn't put it past him to try for a massive abuse of power. 3780494]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China may be stealing organs from prisoners 3780447]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[SYDNEY — New research with substantial evidence is accusing China of stealing organs from prisoners, reports The Conversation.

The study published in the medical journal BMJ Open reviewed 445 medical papers published between January 2000 and April 2017. 

The collected data included a total of 85,477 transplants.

Organs and transplants are commonplace in medical research, however, three criteria must be met in order for such papers to be published: the biological material cannot come from executed prisoners, it must be approved by a human research ethics committee and it must include the donor's consent.

The research found that the majority of the over 85,000 papers reviewed did not comply with these standards.

Results showed that 92.5 percent of the papers did not reveal whether or not the organs used were from executed prisoners. A staggering 99 percent did not report whether the organ donor had given consent. Surprisingly, 73 percent of the papers claimed to have been approved by an ethics committee.

But where do these organs come from? Nineteen papers published before 2010 reported that the organs they used were from voluntary donors, however, China did not have a deceased organ donor program until 2010.

This has led authors of the study to believe that the organs that were not reported were likely obtained through forced organ harvesting of both corrupt prisoners and prisoners of conscience.

The authors are proposing the withdrawal of the papers that do not conform to international ethical standards. They are also calling the transplant community to assemble to create new policies for future papers. 3780447]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Russia plans to disconnect itself from the global internet 3780423]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW — Russian authorities plan to cut the country off from the global internet temporarily this spring to study how it can operate independently from the outside world.

The news was reported last week by Russian news agency RosBiznesKonsalting, according to ZD Net.

A draft law called the Digital Economy National Program was introduced to Russia's parliament last year.

The law was written to ensure that Russian internet providers can maintain an independent Russian internet space to combat foreign cyber attacks.

Russian companies would be required under the law to install technical means to be able to reroute almost all internet traffic to local networks.

In 2017 Izvestia reported that Russia's ministry of communications wanted to decrease the amount of traffic routed through foreign servers to 5 percent by 2020.

The tests will most likely take place before April 1. They are expected to provide feedback and insight as to how the government can work to improve on this new law. 

The tests are predicted to cause major disruptions to Russian internet traffic, ZD Net cites Russian news agency RosBiznesKonsalting as saying.

The Russian government has also been providing cash to the internet service providers to upgrade infrastructure and install new servers to redirect internet traffic.

If successful, unplugging the Russian internet in such a way would create a censorship system similar to China's Great Firewall. 3780423]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND — An Air New Zealand plane on its way to Shanghai was forced to turn back because paperwork for the flight included a reference for Taiwan.

According to Stuff, Air NZ flight 289 left Auckland on schedule, around 11:45 p.m. on Saturday. But four and a half hours into the flight, the pilot announced that Chinese authorities hadn't given the plane permission to land, so they needed to turn back.

The plane landed back in Auckland at 10 a.m. on Sunday. A passenger on the flight said they were offered a hotel room for the day, airport food vouchers, and a taxi voucher, and rescheduled for an 11 p.m. flight.

In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, the carrier said the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner assigned to the Shanghai flight entered its fleet late last year and hadn't been certified to fly to China.

A fresh application had been submitted, which included Taipei in the list of destinations it operates to. According to Stuff, multiple sources said China took the Taiwan reference as acknowledgement that the island was independent.

This is a sore spot for Beijing, who's basically been strong-arming international airlines and companies to refer to Taiwan as Chinese territory.

For the record, Taiwan is a democratically governed, fully sovereign nation. In short, not China's. 3780421]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MELBOURNE — New research published in the journal Science Advances reveals that honeybees are capable of understanding simple math problems.

The Australian research team began by teaching 14 honeybees the basic rules of arithmetic. They trained them to enter a Y-shaped maze where they first faced a series of colored geometric shapes.

The number and the color of the shapes would vary. If the shapes were blue the bee had to add one unit to the image presented at the entrance. If the shapes were yellow it had to subtract one unit.

If they chose the correct answer they would be rewarded with sugar water, if the answer was incorrect they would get a bitter solution called quinine. After 100 trials that took 4-7 hours, the bees had learned a basic concept of addition and subtraction.

The bees were able to choose the correct answer between 63 and 72 percent of the time. 3780419]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPEI — A Taiwanese BuzzFeed reporter based in London decided to hop on the cultural appropriation bus by tweeting out that only people from countries that celebrate Lunar New Years get to observe the holiday. 
According to Taiwan News, on Feb. 7, BuzzFeed reporter Kassandra Cho tweeted out, friendly reminder that you don't get to celebrate lunar new year unless you're literally from a country that does or if you are invited by someone who is from a country that does.
Cue the outrage and hilarity. Thousands of responses then blew up Cho's thread like Lunar New Year's firecrackers. 
Twitter user Andy Wang posted, I hereby formally invite everyone to celebrate lunar new year.
Nazi pug guy Count Dankula was then kind enough to point out how ironic it was that Cho had previously written articles on how Taiwan celebrates Halloween, considering Asians didn't invent Halloween. 
Cho's tweet has since racked up 2,183 likes and over 8,800 comments. 
Clearly it's not that big of a deal either way. Celebrate Lunar Year Year or don't celebrate Lunar New Year. 

Just for the love of Christ don't call it Chinese New Year, because it's not their new year. 3781378]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Sleep fights inflammation and atherosclerosis in mice 3781372]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BOSTON — A new study published in the journal Nature has found that getting adequate sleep can help by reducing inflammation in the body and fighting against atherosclerosis. 
According to Live Science, the study found that fragmented sleep in mice affects levels of a certain hormone, which then increases production of inflammatory cells in the bone marrow. This inflammation plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis. 
Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaques made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances build up inside arteries.  
The new study looked at mice that were genetically prone to atherosclerosis. Some of the mice were allowed to get adequate sleep, while another group's sleep was frequently interrupted by a sweep bar that automatically swept across the bottom of the cage. 

The scientists found the sleep-deprived mice had larger arterial plaques and higher levels of inflammation in their blood vessels compared with the sleep-sufficient mice. 
Researchers also discovered sleep-deprived mice had lower levels of the hormone hypocretin, which led to an increase in the levels of the signalling protein CSF1. This in turn increased production of inflammatory white blood cells in the bone marrow and accelerated atherosclerosis. 
The team found that by restoring hypocretin levels in the mice reduced atherosclerosis. 
According to study senior author Filip Swirski, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Systems Biology, we have discovered that sleep helps regulate the production… of inflammatory cells and the health of blood vessels and that, conversely, sleep disruption breaks down control of inflammatory cell production, leading to more inflammation and heart disease.  
The next step will be for researchers to see if the results can be replicated in humans. 3781372]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[GREENLAND — Researchers have discovered what may be another massive crater below Greenland's ice sheets, NASA announced on Monday. 

According to Space.com, the suspected crater is around 22 miles or 36 kilometers wide, but has not been definitively identified yet as an impact crater. 
According the NBC News, this comes just months after other scientists discovered a 19-mile-wide impact crater under the Hiawatha glacier. 
Joe MacGregor, a glaciologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, is a co-author of the paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, which describes the find. He was also on the team that found the Hiawatha crater.  
After the finding the Hiawatha crater, MacGregor and his team analyzed topographic maps and satellite imagery to see if there might be other craters in the area. 
That's when they discovered the second bowl-shaped feature 114 miles southeast of the Hiawatha crater. 

According to NBC, the presence was confirmed using Operation IceBridge data, an ongoing NASA mission which uses planes to map changes in ice in the polar regions. 
In order for researchers to determine if this second structure is actually an impact crater, scientists will need to conduct more field work or obtain core samples to confirm the discovery. 
According to NBC, the team says they are unsure how old the structure is, but they estimated it was formed 100,000 to 100 million years ago. 3781366]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TORONTO — A Tibetan student from the University of Toronto Scarborough is facing online harassment after being elected student union president, reports The Varsity.

The university's student newspaper reports that Chemi Lhamo received over 10,000 comments on a Lunar New Year Instagram post, most of them from angry Chinese netizens who criticized her for openly supporting a free Tibet.

Just 3 days after Lhamo was elected, a petition was created on Change.org called We don't want such a person to be student union president.  

The petition was created by an individual who identifies themselves as Kennedy L. They claim Chemi is irrational for being deep into a group called Free Tibet and that she has too much political involvement with that outside group.  Over 10,000 people have signed the petition. 

A counter petition has been submitted on the same website called, Let Chemi remain as Student Union Presidential Candidate. In that one, the author writes that Lhamo is fit for her presidency and that she does not deserve all those hateful comments about her nature or character on social media.

Lhamo claims she grew up as a stateless Tibetan refugee in India. She told The Varsity she has plans to create a mentorship program for Tibetan youth in Canada. 

Lhamo had this to say about her online bullies, This is just an example of China's long arms, how they still think and inherently believe that they can intimidate me into not running for Presidency.

According to FreeTibet.org, China claims to have liberated and democratically reformed Tibet in the 1950s. Many saw this so-called 'liberation' as an invasion and the forced establishment of the Communist Regime. 3781208]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS — The oceans are expected to become bluer and greener by the end of the 21st Century, according to a study published in Nature Communications.

Researchers from MIT and the University of Southampton noted that phytoplankton at the surface of the sea absorbs and reflects the sunlight. This gives the ocean its current bluish-green hue.

Rising temperatures and acidity will cause phytoplankton in the water to decrease in number, essentially changing the color of the ocean as less sunlight is absorbed.

The study explains that parts of the ocean will gradually turn a deep blue in color while others gradually turn darker green over the next 80 years. However, this change probably won't be visible to the naked eye, lead author of the study, Dr. Stephanie Dutkiewicz, told the BBC.

The researchers were experimenting on the assumption that ocean temperatures would have risen by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100.

Weather patterns such as El Nino or La Nina could also change the color of the ocean, according to a press release by MIT. 3781149]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[PYONGYANG, NORTH KOREA — A new study by Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation reports that North Korea continues to build nuclear weapons.

Open-source satellite images featured in a report by Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation show that  North Korea has not stopped production of nuclear weapons.

Reuters reports that spent nuclear fuel generated at Yongbyon, North Korea's main nuclear plant, appears to have been reprocessed in May 2018.

Researchers believe North Korea may have also produced 5 to 8 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium. The report estimates that North Korea may have created an additional 5 to 7 nuclear weapons using plutonium and highly enriched uranium.

Experts who participated in the study told Reuters that they believe North Korea doesn't have the capacity to reach the U.S. However, neighboring countries such as Japan and South Korea are still in danger.

North Korea has stopped conducting nuclear tests. In 2018, the country did not flight test missiles of any range. 3781138]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NORWALK, OHIO — Ethan Lindenberger is 18 years old, and for his birthday he decided to treat himself to getting vaccinated, according to NPR. 

Because Ethan's mother Jill Wheeler is anti-vaccine, he was never vaccinated for hepatitis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, or chickenpox—yikes. 
According to NPR, Lindenberger posted on Reddit last November asking for help on getting vaccinated and was flooded with more than 1,000 responses. 

According to the CDC, as of January this year, measles has been confirmed in 10 states,  with the agency also watching outbreaks in New York state and the Big Apple. Let that sink in for a moment.    

After doing his own digging, Ethan tried to start a conversation with is mom by giving her a CDC article about how vaccines don't cause autism. Let's just say that didn't go too well. 

According to NPR, Lindenberger got his first round of shots for HPV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and flu, which has caused a bit of tension with mom and pops on the home front. 

Thank god Ethan is now legally an adult, which means his mom can't stop him from getting vaccinated, though that hasn't stopped her from trying to show him the anti-vax light. 
Ethan has a date with more shots scheduled for later this month. 3781049]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Violent video games don't fuel teen aggression, study finds 3782105]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[OXFORD, UNITED KINGDOM — Violent video games have long been blamed for triggering aggression in teens, but a new study from the University of Oxford finds that that's not actually the case. 

A comprehensive new study published in Royal Society Open Science has found no evidence that playing violent video games can make teens more aggressive.

Researchers surveyed 1,000 British 14 and 15-year-olds on their gaming habits and behavior, with in-game violence assessed using UK and US ratings.

They then interviewed parents and guardians to see if they thought their child had become antisocial or displayed any aggression.

As it turns out, playing bloodthirsty games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, or Grand Theft Auto doesn't make your kid more angry or prone to violence than one who doesn't.

Lead researcher Andrew Przybylski told Sky News that a lot of things feed into aggression. Gender and a person's background have some effect, but it's personal frustrations, family or life circumstances that fuel it more than the actual video game.

That's not to say games don't provoke angry outbursts, but they're more of a reaction to certain gaming situations and mechanics, and less a behavior that's cause for concern.

So next time someone warns you that video games will make you violent, tell 'em that myth's been busted. 3782105]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[YONGZHOU, CHINA — A husky from the Chinese city of Yongzhou was so excited to see his owner, he did his best Air Bud impression from the second floor of a house and landed right on the guy.
According to Oddity Central, the 67-year-old owner named Liu was out visiting some fam on Monday before heading back home. 
According to Liu in a Sina News interview, they were just about to get to his front door when something fell from the sky and landed right on him. 
At first, Liu thought the wall of his house had collapsed on top of him. Actually, it turned out to be their 60-pound pooch.
The impact was so intense, it knocked Liu out cold and also caused a cervical spine fracture.
Liu's family then called an ambulance, so that he could be transported to the hospital. 
Liu will now have to undergo surgery to fix his spine. 
Luckily the dog is okay. Unfortunately, the Lius being the great canine loving family they are, have now chained the dog up in the yard. 3781882]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — San Francisco-based startup, Elroy Air, is developing an autonomous drone that could be used to haul heavy cargo as early as next year, according to the company's website.

The company has already raised US$9.2 million from investors to build the aircraft called Chaparral, Forbes reports.

Its new self-flying drone will be able to carry 225 kg of cargo and fly 500 kilometers while in the air, according to Elroy Air's website.

The drone is said to use a grasping mechanism to automatically pick up and release cargo pods.

The aircraft will use six electric rotors for vertical take-offs and landings, Forbes reports.

A hybrid-electric powertrain system will be used to power the self-flying drone. This will allow fewer pollutants to be scattered in the air, according to the company's website.

Its website explains that the drone could also be used in humanitarian ways, such as to carry life saving supplies to disaster relief areas.

The drone will undergo testing this year and is expected to be put into service by 2020. 3781808]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Spain may have 3rd election after budget rejected 3781787]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MADRID — Spain Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez might have to call for a third general election in less than four years after his budget was rejected by right-wing parties, reports The New York Times.

Pedro Sanchez came to power in mid-2018 after ousting then prime minister Mariano Rajoy with the support of Catalan separatist lawmakers. Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party needed their support to expel Rajoy as they only hold 84 of the 350 seats in Congress.

According to The New York Times, this time around Catalan pro-independence parties rejected Sanchez's government budget plan and sided with the People's Party and the center-right Citizen's party. The budget was rejected 191 to 158 with one abstention.

The shift in alliance comes after Catalan pro-independence parties made it clear that support for the budget would only come if independence talks were held. However, Sanchez's government sustains that, according to Spain's constitution, the country must remain united. 

Spain is divided into 17 autonomous regions. Catalonia is one of the wealthiest of them. According to CNBC, it accounts for roughly 20 percent of the country's GDP.

The political instability that continues to loom over Spain is a result of the 2017   referendum for Catalonian independence which was deemed illegal by the Spanish constitutional court. 3781787]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[New artificial leaf design can absorb CO2 from air 3781719]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHICAGO — Scientists have developed a way to bring artificial leaves out of the lab and into a natural environment, where they can help clean the air.

According to Futurism, existing artificial leaves can mimic photosynthesis, but draw pure carbon dioxide from pressurized tanks in the lab. As such, they fail to be effective in the real world, where they need to be able to draw from more dilute sources.

UIC Today reports that researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago solved this problem by encasing the leaf in a semi-permeable membrane filled with water.

When warmed by sunlight, water evaporates out, and carbon dioxide is pulled in. An artificial photosystem then converts CO2 to carbon monoxide and oxygen.

Carbon monoxide can be used to create various synthetic fuels, including gasoline and methanol. The oxygen can either be collected or released into the environment.

The researchers calculate that 360 of the 1.7 meter long and 0.2 meter wide leaves could produce a half ton of carbon monoxide per day. The same number of leaves spread out in a 500 square meter area could also reduce CO2 levels within 100 meters by 10% in just one day.

The conceptual design for the leaves reportedly use readily available technology and materials, and will be 10 times more effective than natural leaves at converting CO2 to fuel. 3781719]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TOKYO — Dating event in Japan uses small robots to help single people find love, reports The Japan News.

Japan has decided to deal with first-date jitters in the most, well, Japanese way possible — with tiny cute robots.

A recent event for single peeps in Tokyo provided attendees with tiny bots that essentially acted as wingmen. The event was organized by an artificial intelligence technology company called  Contents innovation Program Association, or CiP for short.

The event — appropriately known as a 'robot marriage-hunting' party — was meant to help out timid men and women between the ages of 25 to 39 to find a forever partner. The event planners were really meticulous about it too. Participants had to answer questions on 45 different subjects. 

The organizers then uploaded the participants' answers to the cupid-robots. That way the robots could take over and introduce the lovebirds to each other. The cupid-bots turned out to successful. Results of the event showed that four new couples had been formed.

Event-goers were very satisfied. They had this to say about the 'party': Thanks to the robot, I wasn't really nervous. and It was easy because the robot explained everything about me, and I didn't have to say anything during multiple interactions.

Japan is known for using objects as surrogates for human emotions. In November last year, a 35-year-old man married a small doll in the form of Japanese Vocaloid pop star Hatsune Miku. 3781691]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA['Carlton dance' cannot be copyrighted: U.S. Copyright Office 3783487]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — Alfonso Ribeiro's copyright claims for the famous 'Carlton dance' have been denied by the United States Copyright Office, reports The New York Times.  

In December, Alfonso Ribeiro, famous for playing Carlton Banks in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, filed a lawsuit against Take-Two Interactive's NBA 2K18 and Epic Games' Fortnite for using his character's signature dance move.

The U.S. Copyright Office has officially denied his copyright claims. The ruling was filed in one of Ribeiro's two lawsuits. Turns out that, just like a short phrase or word, a simple dance move cannot be copyrighted, no matter how famous it is.

A copyright registration supervisor put it very bluntly saying that, the combination of these three dance steps is a simple routine that is not registrable as a choreographic work. 

However, it's important to note that a court is not obligated to follow the copyright office's determination, but it will likely take it into consideration.

Ribeiro's lawyer, David L. Hecht, hasn't given up yet. According to him, It's the same as when you combine notes in a musical composition, and, as such, they should be eligible to have copyright protection under the law. 

Hecht also represents rapper 2 Milly and Russell Horning, better known as 'Back-pack Kid'. Both have also filed similar lawsuits for their own dances being featured in Fortnite.

2 Milly's request was also rejected but surprisingly, Horning was able to register a variation of his dance. Hecht said he would ask the copyright office reconsider 2 Milly's and Ribeiro's requests. 3783487]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Jamal Khashoggi's remains may have been burned, report 3783485]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[ANKARA — A new report from the Turkish police states that Jamal Khashoggi's remains may have been burned up in the consulate.

Washington Post journalist and Saudi dissident, Jamal Khashoggi, was killed by a Saudi hit squad on October 2. He had arrived at the country's consulate in Istanbul to retrieve documents he needed in order to marry his Turkish fiance, Hatice Cengiz.

Khashoggi was last seen in CCTV footage as he entered the consulate at about 13:14 local time. He left both his phones with his fiancee instructing her to call for help if he didn't return.

Upon entering he encountered Saudi intelligence officer Maher Mutreb, who told the journalist, 'You are coming back,' according to a CNN source who read the transcript of an audio recording of Khashoggi's death.

This is when the hit squad is thought to have seized Khashoggi and suffocated him by putting a plastic bag over his head. Khashoggi's final words were, 'I can't breathe.' The transcript then goes on to describe the sound of a saw assumed to be used for his dismemberment. Khashoggi's last gasps and screams can be heard at the same time.

During this time Khashoggi's fiancee was still waiting outside the consulate. She stayed until 1:00 am and came back the following day after he still hadn't returned.

Turkey's state-run news agency Anadolu quoted a recent police report that states that Khashoggi's remains may have been burned in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

The report states that the consulate has two wells and a gas and wood furnace that could reach over 1,000 degrees Celsius. This furnace could have been used to destroy traces of Khashoggi's DNA.

Police also revealed that the hit squad had ordered 32 pieces of raw meat from a restaurant to the consulate after killing Khashoggi.

The report also suggests that Khashoggi's fiancee could have been the second victim of the killing if the hit squad had been informed that she was waiting outside.

Turkish authorities know that one of the members of the hit squad is Lieutenant Colonel Salah Mohammed A. Tubaigy, a forensic expert from the Saudi Interior Ministry.

Tubaigy has taught in the criminal evidence department at Naif Arab University for Security Sciences in Riyadh. They believe the 47-year-old expert helped dispose of Khashoggi's body. 3783485]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — Xi Jinping's new social propaganda app has become hugely popular on the App Store in China over the past few days, thanks to a little strong-arming by the Communist Party.

According to the BBC, the app is called Xue Xi Qiang Guo, or Study the Great Nation, with Xue Xi also a pun meaning to study President Xi.

The government wasted no time in launching the app on the first day of the lunar year, no doubt so Communist Party members, civil servants, state-owned company employees, and public school teachers can get their fill of propaganda. You know, since they've been required to.

According to the New York Times, lucky users can catch up on the latest state media reports and brush up on 'Xi Jinping Thought.' They can also treat themselves to a quote of the day from Winnie the Pooh's doppelganger, weekly quizzes, and a television show called 'Xi Time.' How exciting.

The Little Red App is also equipped with Snapchat-style messaging, video chat, and calendar functions — all the better for the government to keep an eye on its peoples with.

Like with everything in China, doing each activity earns users points that can be redeemed for prizes later on.

Though some backside-smooching institutions and employers are apparently requiring their employees to earn a certain number of points each day. Otherwise, dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow, dishonor on your whole family!

Needless to say, the ratings on the app say it all — a measly 2.7 out of five. 3783431]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[AURORA, ILLINOIS — A man opened fire on his coworkers after losing his job at an Illinois manufacturing plant, using a gun he wasn't even supposed to have.

The Chicago Tribune reports that while at a termination meeting at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, Illinois, Gary Martin pulled out a handgun to shoot and kill the three people in the room with him.

Martin then went on a gun rampage inside the office, shooting dead two coworkers just outside the meeting room and injuring another.

According to CNN, the 45-year-old gunman shot and wounded five of the first police officers who arrived on the scene, before fleeing into the sprawling manufacturing plant.

Aurora police Deputy Chief Keefe Jackson said over 200 to 300 officers from 35 agencies were deployed to the scene to hunt for the suspect and help rescue victims.

The police found Martin in a back machine shop an hour later. He opened fire on the officers, who fired back, killing him.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Martin had been carrying the gun illegally. Police said he bought the handgun in 2014 after getting an Illinois firearm owner's identification card.

A background check failed to turn up a felony aggravated assault charge in Mississippi 25 years earlier, which would've disqualified him from legally owning a gun.

But it wasn't until Martin applied for a concealed carry permit that his conviction was flagged and his firearm owner's ID card revoked. According to CNN, he was instructed to voluntarily relinquish his gun, but never did. 3783424]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China's latest viral trend is pretending to fly 3783350]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHINA — A new viral trend in China involves using everyday household items to look like people are flying in planes. 
According to the Independent, the general idea is to create the illusion that one is cruising 30,000 feet in the air, so that people think you're on a fabulous vacay, when  you're actually just at home.
The videos started popping up on short video app Douyin—aka Tik Tok—over Lunar New Years, when people normally head off for vacation. 
The clips start out with what looks like people gazing out an airplane window at some crazy scenery below or the plane taking off.  

The videos then pull back to show that the window is actually just some random object  like detergent bottle handles, plastic stools or toilet seats.  
Emergency support animals are also getting in on the craze. 
On Weibo, China's Twitter knockoff, the hashtag how to pretend you're on a plane has more than 27 million views. It has more than 24 million views on Douyin. 
So if you're creative, have too much time on your hands, are a bit depressed and have a random toilet seat lying around, you need to immediately hop on this trend. 
  
Honestly though, seems like a lot of work for something completely fake. Guess that also describes all of Instagram. 3783350]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HAMDEN, CONNECTICUT — Did you brush your teeth today—with someone else's Number 2? 

According to Lad Bible, if you're one of those people that keeps your toothbrush in the bathroom—so that would include almost everyone—there's a good possibility that it's covered in faecal matter floating in the air after every flush. 
Not closing the lid when flushing and keeping your toothbrush close at hand can create ideal conditions for things like E. Coli, Clostridium difficile and norovirus to land on the bristles and start multiplying. 
According to a study at Quinnipiac University, if you're lucky enough to get to use a communal bathroom with an average of nine people, there's a 60 percent chance your toothbrush is covered in fecal coliforms. 
And the cherry on top—okay, more like a chocolate covered cherry—is that there's an 80 percent chance those doo doo particles are from someone else using the same bathroom.    
According to researcher Lauren Aber talking to Science Daily, the main concern is not the presence of your own faecal matter on your toothbrush, but rather when a toothbrush is contaminated with faecal matter from someone else, which contains bacteria, viruses or parasites that are not part of your normal flora.
The study also found that obsessively cleaning your toothbrush with hot water or mouthwash didn't make a difference, neither did a cover. 
So is it time to switch out that toothbrush, or continue playing toilet toothbrush craps? 3783233]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA — A thief down under has been using gum to steal money from ATM users around the Gold Coast. 
According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, a man has been shoving chewing gum on dispensers to stop bills from coming out. 
When unsuspecting users notice their money hasn't come out, they walk off to find someone to help them get their money out. 
That's when the suspect sneaks up and takes the cash out. According to its operator, the man has made off with at least $1,000 from a single ATM.

According to other ATM operators, the suspect doesn't always take the money. Sometimes, he just blocks the dispenser with gum. 
So far, no official complaint has been made to the police. When will this sticky bandit chew again? 3783185]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[USA / CHINA — The U.S. and China have not yet an accord in crucial trade talks, reports The South China Morning Post. 

Beijing and Washington continue to disagree on matters such as equal market access and protection of intellectual property during trade talks.

According to Business Insider, both sides are seeking to lower tariffs and ease trade tensions.

Anonymous sources told The New York Times, the U.S. wants to create a process that will increase taxes on Chinese products if its American exports continue to rise.

If a trade deal isn't locked in by March 1, the US will raise taxes from 10 to 25 percent on US$200 billion worth of Chinese products, Business Insider reports.

US President Donald Trump is considering pushing the deadline back by 60 days, Bloomberg reports.

The South China Morning Post reports the talks are currently being conducted by US trade representative Robert E. Lighthizer, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He.

If they can't reach an agreement, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might have to hold a meeting to hash out a deal. 3783171]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[JP Morgan to launch first U.S. bank-backed cryptocurrency 3783134]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY — JP Morgan is creating its own cryptocurrency, and is becoming the first major U.S. bank to do so.

According to CNBC, the nation's largest bank, JP Morgan Chase, announced on Thursday that it would be launching its own cryptocurrency called the JPM coin, which has a fixed value redeemable for $1.

The coin is designed to be used by big institutional customers such as corporations, banks, and broker-dealers rather than individuals.

According to the bank's head of blockchain projects, the digital token is meant to speed up international payments, which traditionally take a day or more to settle via wire transfer. It can also be used for securities transactions and treasury services.

When clients want to move dollars on the bank's Quorum blockchain system, money in their accounts is converted to JPM coins.

According to Fox Business, 'the tokens are transferred and instantaneously redeemed' for the equivalent amount of dollars.

The New York Times reports that JP Morgan hopes to increase the coin's versatility, perhaps expanding in the future to represent currencies other than the dollar. 3783134]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Two Indonesian volcanoes found to be interconnected: Study 3783036]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BALI, INDONESIA — New research has found that the two volcanoes may actually be connected via the same plumbing system.

A team of scientists were monitoring volcanic activity at the Agung volcano to find out what caused its sudden eruption in 2017, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications.

Using satellite technology by the European Space Agency, researchers from the University of Bristol were able to map out ground motion between the Agung volcano and the neighboring volcano Batur.

Juliet Biggs, who lead the study, explained in a University of Bristol press release that this could indicate movement of fresh magma underneath the volcano.

Fabien Albino, a researcher involved with the study, is quoted as saying in the same press release that they noticed the magma must be moving sideways as well as moving upwards vertically as earthquake activity was noticed upto 5 km away from the summit.

He added that the study provides geophysical evidence that shows that Mount Agung and Mount Batur may actually have a connected plumbing system.

Albino went on to explain the study has important implications for predicting volcano eruptions and could also be used to explain two volcanic explosions taking place at the same time.

Mount Agung suddenly erupted in November of 2017 after remaining dormant for 50 years.

Bali's main airport was closed down while thousands of residents were forced to evacuate, CNN reported at the time. 3783036]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[SPACE — A large asteroid hurtling through space at breakneck speeds is going to pass by our planet, but don't worry — it's not gonna hit.

NASA's asteroid trackers have been monitoring asteroid 2013 MD8 since its discovery in 2013. The space rock measures between 128 to 282 feet, making it nearly as tall as London's Big Ben.

2013 MD8 is classified as a Near Earth Object. These are asteroids and comets composed of water ice and embedded dust particles, which are nudged by gravitational attraction into a trajectory that allows them to cut into Earth's orbit.

NASA announced that the asteroid will pass Earth on February 19, at 12:55 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, while traveling at a speed of 30,418 miles per hour.

At its closest, 2013 MD8 will be 0.0387 astronomical units from Earth, or roughly 15.1 lunar distances.

According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the space rock's next close approach to Earth won't be until January 28, 2022. 3783920]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — Super-touchy Chinese netizens are once again getting their undies in a twist, this time over an ad from Zara.

According to the BBC, the Spanish fashion label's new cosmetics campaign features model Jing Wen and her iconic freckles.

You'd think the Chinese would've been happy that she was the face of the campaign, but apparently people have issues with her spots.

Offended netizens claimed that putting such ugly freckles on display was insulting, and complained that the model didn't look like she was in a good, energetic mood.

Some even suggested that Zara picked the freckled model on purpose to defame the Chinese, nevermind that Jing Wen is a pro who's modelled for top brands and been on the cover of Vogue China.

Zara responded to the haters by saying the ad wasn't targeted specifically at China, and put the backlash down to a difference in aesthetics. The brand added that the models were photographed as is, with no digital touch ups.

This prompted other users to chime in with support for both Zara and Jing Wen, and criticism for their vitriolic countrymen.

And in a twist absolutely no one expected, state-run China Daily came out with an editorial basically calling out the whiners, telling them to suck it up and quit being snowflakes. 3783882]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CHONGQING, CHINA — China has ambitious plans to build the first ever solar power station in space.

China's Science and Technology Daily reports the country is planning to build a solar power station that would orbit the earth at a distance of 36,000 kilometers.

The newspaper quotes Li Ming, vice-president of The China Academy of Space Technology, as saying in 2017 that China has the potential to become the first country to build a solar power station with practical value in space if it continues to increase development at its current speed.

Pang Zhihao, a researcher from the China Academy of Space Technology, told the newspaper the solar station would be able to draw energy from the sun without any interference from Earth's atmosphere.

Pang said the orbital power plant would be able to provide a stable supply of energy back to Earth upto 99 percent of the time, at six times the intensity of regular solar farms.

The scientists are expected to build a small to medium-sized solar power station and launch it to the stratosphere between 2021 and 2025, according to Science and Technology Daily.

Pang said the team is also contemplating whether to use robots and 3D printing technology to build the power station in space, as its weight could exceed 1,000 tonnes. 3783528]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[LONDON — A white woman who changed races seems to think she and her very white husband's future babies will all be born black.

According to the Telegraph, German-born Martina Big was once as as white and blonde as they came, but several surgeries and tanning injections later, is now 100% black...at least on the outside.

In her Facebook page, the 30-year-old claims she identifies as black, specifically African, and says she spent weeks in Kenya learning about tribal culture.

She got baptized in a church and given a Swahili name while there, and now claims to be a real African woman. Yeah...pretty sure that just makes you Christian, honey.

While on ITV's This Morning last month, Big revealed she'd gotten hitched, and whaddya know, hubby Michael is white on the inside and artificially Afro on the outside, just like her. 

But here's the deluded cherry on top of this twisted tale. Big claims she was told by her doctor that she and her husband's future offspring will come out black. Guess we know what kind of doctor he is.

Even when confronted with basic biology and genetics, Big seemed confident the kid will at least be milk chocolate since, you know, it's a mix of her and hubby. Though even if it's not, clearly, there are ways to transform that poor, poor child. 

Needless to say, people weren't having any of Big's Kool Aid. Twitter user @jus_relaxing called her behavior racist, while @littlelady2004 thinks she's disrespectful.

Us? We think the delusion runs deep. 3784533]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ATLANTA — A new report by Shadow Proof claims that CNN manufactured their latest claims against a Russia-funded media company.

Facebook recently suspended three video news pages run by a Berlin-based company called Maffick Media. Ruptly, a subsidiary of state-owned RT, owns 52 percent of the company.

Maffick Media is claiming that CNN is using the fact that the company is funded by Russia to stoke the already-flaming 'Russia-phobia' fire.

A report by Shadow Proof, a blog that covers journalistic injustices, noted the ways in which they believe CNN 'manufactured the news.'

Maffick Media has three main video pages on Facebook: 'Backthen,' which covers the history of Western Imperialism, 'Waste-Ed,' which covers environmental news, and 'Soapbox,' which covers political news.

Their political videos often criticize American intervention in other democracies, particularly during the imperial era and the Cold War.

The report states that CNN was looking to out Maffic Media's channels after learning about their link with Russia through the German Marshall Fund, a self-proclaimed nonpartisan American public policy think tank funded by the US government.

The report believes that they brought up the tip to Facebook, which responded by suspending the pages. Only when Facebook suspended the pages did they run the news.

Soapbox producer and journalist Rania Khalek and Maffick Media COO, J. Ray Spark were interviewed by the CNN for the story. 

However, according to Khalek, CNN had previously approached other employees for information on the company claiming that they had spoken to Khalek beforehand when they had not.

CNN also misquoted Spark in the interview, only correcting the quote after Shadow Proof's report had called them out on it.

In a statement on their page, Maffick Media said, 'None of our content promotes disinformation or fake news.'
 
In the same statement, Maffick Media also called out other state-funded media outlets including America's NPR, the UK's BBC, Germany's DW and Qatar's AJ+ and questioned why these do not have to openly disclose that they are government funded.

Even Donie O'Sullivan, a CNN reporter who worked on the story, told CNN in an interview that the company's videos made a 'lot of legitimate arguments,' and they 'weren't necessarily really hiding their Russian ties.' 3784506]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[The great white shark's genome finally decoded 3784502]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK — A research team mapped the great white shark's genome and found the keys to many of its special adaptations, according to CNET.
 
Great white sharks are known for their beady black eyes and sharp rows of teeth, but there's more to sharks than just their jaws.

Turns out sharks are made of a pretty outstanding genome.

The great white shark's genome contains large amounts of information. They have 41 pairs of chromosomes while humans only have 23.

The results of a study carried out by a team of researchers examining the great white's genome were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 

These showed that a set of genes involved in wound healing and another set involved with blood clotting had evolved significantly among sharks, allowing them to recover from injuries much faster than other organisms.

Findings also showed that great whites have genetic adaptations that help them preserve a stable genome. The same genes that are involved in genome stability also have the ability to fight cancer.

People have taken the whole 'sharks have cancer-fighting genes' a bit too seriously though. Demand for shark fin soup is also pushing the species to extinction. According to One Green Planet, roughly 100 million sharks are killed for their fins every year. 3784502]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HARBIN, HEILONGJIANG — A teenager from China purchased a writing-robot to finish her homework during her vacation, reports Qianjiang Evening News. 

During year's Lunar New Year celebrations, a teenaged-girl from China decided she wouldn't let homework get in the way of her holidays — by purchasing a US$120 robot to do her homework.

The girl's mother was surprised that her daughter had finished her homework in record time —and neatly on top of that. Her surprise turned to outrage when she discovered the nifty device while she was cleaning her daughter's room. The mother smashed the robot and angrily shared her experience on social media.

According to the South China Morning Post, the contraption is known as a 'copying robot', it comes with a robotic arm to which you attach a pen or pencil and its software allows you to write in all types of fonts.

Its main selling point though is that it can create very realistic handwritten text if the user inputs their own handwriting into a special app. The user has to input 6,000 samples of different characters so the robot can learn them.

Chinese netizens were supportive of the young girl on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, some comparing her shortcut to them sticking pens together in a row to copy several words at once when they were in school. Others said that teachers should make an effort in assigning more creative homework, not just forcing students to copy text over and over again. 3784499]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — If you’re wondering why on this totally flat disc of an Earth, we’re starting to see Flat Earthers everywhere—blame YouTube. 

SOURCES: Guardian, BBC
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/17/study-blames-youtube-for-rise-in-number-of-flat-earthers
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47279253

According to the Guardian, Professor Asheley Landrum from Texas Tech University carried out a study at two Flat Earth annual conferences: Raleigh, North Carolina in 2017 and Denver, Colorado in 2018. 

He presented his findings at the annual Association for the Advancement of Science meeting. 

Based on 30 Flat Earther interviews, they found several who cited YouTube videos as Earth-flattening in terms of how much influence they had on seeing the Flat Earth truth. 

Researchers also found out that many of the attendees had ended down the rabbit hole after watching other conspiracy theories at home. Other conspiracy theories?

Others said they originally started watching in order to criticize them, but then due to the science-esque explanations in the YouTube videos, ended up hopping on the Flat Earth train. 

According to Landrum, “there’s a lot of helpful information on YouTube but also a lot of misinformation.” Unfortunately, that pretty much describes the entire internet. 

He also said there was a need for scientists and science advocates to make their own YouTube videos that have things like—facts!? 3784417]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MAOMING, CHINA — Australia-based Chinese female bodybuilder Lara Zhang has been involved in a back in forth with China's super annoying cyber cops over some bodybuilding video she posted on Weibo last year. 

Her Weibo account shows she first posted the clip in July 2018, but for some reason it only recently caught the attention of internet po po from the city of Maoming. 

These idiots warned Zhang there could be legal consequences of posting content they deemed obscene on the Chinese INTRANET.
Police were kind enough to comment saying, according to the national security laws and cybersecurity regulations, it's illegal to publish or spread obscene or pornographic information on the internet. Such behavior is subject to investigation by public security departments and will be punished in accordance with relevant laws. 
Zhang should have known better. Only the CCP has the right to spread obscene and false information in China. 
Lara replied to the internet nannies defending her video and women's bodybuilding. She said what she did in the video was just how female contestants pose during actual competitions. 
She also wrote, I don't care about how average people see me because everyone views beauty differently. But how could a verified account of the police be so regressive and ignorant? I'm entitled to claim my rights.
According to CCP speakerbox the Global Times, the police allegedly apologized to Zhang in private for the false accusations.   
Wonder what Zhang's rights would have been like if she was living in China instead of Australia? 3784408]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CLEVELAND, OHIO — Research published in the Journal of Physiology details a newly found form of neural communication in which neurons that are not connected can send signals to each other.

According to the study, the new type of neural communication is able to move from a neuron in one section of the brain to another. 

Scientists from Case Western Reserve University were testing brain waves in hippocampal slices taken from the brains of decapitated mice. 

According to the study, researchers found that an electrical field was generated at a gradual recurring interval in their sampled brain tissue. This activated nearby cells.

The electric field was also found to stimulate neurons even if there was a gap in the brain tissue. 3784335]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NANTOU, TAIWAN — A Buddhist master in Taiwan has been turning some serious online heads for spinning for four minutes straight and then blowing chunks during a blessing ritual. 
The video was posted last week by Master Huiyen on her Facebook page and has already amassed over a million Facebook views. So in reality that's about a few hundred thousand actual views. 
In the clip, Master Huiyen is seen holding a bottle of holy water—aka normal bottled water—in one of her hands as she proceeds to spin around on a red carpet blessing some Nantou temple. 
As she finishes dumping out one bottle, her assistants immediately hand her another plastic bottled water, so she can continue wasting perfectly good water. 
Huiyen then hilariously proceeds to spin around, all the while dumping out more bottle water. She apparently spun herself around 152 times. 
And maybe because she's Buddhist, that's when karma started to kick it. At around the four minute mark, Master Huiyen starts to feel sick and then hurls all over the red carpet.
But honestly...see how many plastic bottles are also lining the red carpet? What an incredibly horrific waste of water—sorry, holy water. Does that mean all that plastic trash is holy trash?  

It's safe to say Buddha would not be pleased. 3784179]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[FORT WORTH, TEXAS —A Fort Worth hospital is looking for a new elevator contractor after a nurse was critically injured last month when she stepped onto an elevator that continued moving. 
The AP reports that Chief Executive Robert Earley of John Peter Smith Hospital said last week that hospital officials intend to hold current contractor Thyssenkrupp Elevator Corp. accountable for the Jan. 20 accident. 
According to the hospital, nurse Carren Stratford was getting on an elevator, but the lift did not stop moving up as she stepped into it with her right foot. 
Stratford then lost her balance as the elevator continued to rise, and was crushed. 

According to her lawyer Frank Branson, she has suffered severe brain damage, internal injuries and has had multiple seizures, as well as surgeries. She's been in the hospital's ICU since the mishap. 
According to documents obtained by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the hospital's elevators were out of service at least 42 times from January 2018 to this January. Yikes. 
Thyssenkrupp is also being sued by a nurse from another Fort Worth hospital for a Jan. 23, 2018 elevator accident. 
According to the lawsuit, Rogena Wright, who is a nurse at Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital and an administrative supervisor at Harris Alliance, was riding an elevator at Harris-Alliance when it fell several stories causing her to be injured in a violent landing. 3784097]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[FUKUSHIMA, JAPAN — Last week, a probe touched melted nuclear debris in the damaged second reactor at the Fukushima nuclear plant for the first time in almost eight years since the disaster, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company.  

The purpose of the mission was to determine how solid the melted fuel is and whether it could be transported away from the site, according to The Asahi Shimbun.  
The robotic probe designed by Toshiba weighs about 1 kilogram and is fitted with 3-centimeter-long claws. It can extend 15 meters and lift pieces up to 8 centimeters in diameter, that weigh up to 2 kilograms. The probe is also equipped with a dosimeter and a camera.
According to TEPCO, workers manually inserted the probe through a crack in the side of the No. 2 reactor's containment vessel.  
Workers then remotely operated the probe from a building close to the No. 2 reactor building.

The probe lifted pebble-like nuclear fuel debris at five spots and failed to pick up debris in one area. The probe also touched melted fuel on the workers scaffold below the reactor's pressure vessel. 
The retrieval process will start in earnest at one of the reactors in 2021, according to a joint central government and TEPCO plan. 

According to Bloomberg, full decommissioning of the Fukushima plant is expected to take 30 or 40 years. 3785151]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON / CARACAS — Venezuela's economic struggles worsen as the U.S. lays even more sanctions on the country.

What began as social upheaval after the death of Hugo Chavez and the presidency of his hand-picked successor Nicolas Maduro has spiralled into one of the world's largest humanitarian crises.

According to the U.S. Department of State, in March of 2015 Obama had issued an executive order to implement the act. So far, under this act, the Department of the Treasury has sanctioned 65 individuals, six during the Obama administration and 58 during Trump's.

In addition to targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, the Trump administration has imposed additional economic sanctions.

Venezuela is currently experiencing unprecedented levels of poverty, with almost 90 percent of its population living below the poverty line, according to data from ENCOVI, Venezuela's official survey on quality of life.

According to data from ENCOVI, 64.3 percent of families in the country have lost roughly 11.4 kilograms or 25 pounds, and 63.2 percent of adults said they skipped a meal to provide food to their children. 3785082]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA — Neptune's official moon count is now up to 14, after a team of astronomers used NASA's Hubble Space telescope to shed some much needed light on the mini satellite.

According to a press release from the SETI Institute, a tiny moon discovered orbiting Neptune in 2013 has now been named Hippocamp. It is one of the planet's seven inner moons, and the newest of its 14 known moons.

Naming conventions for the Neptune system require something out of Greco-Roman undersea mythology. In Greek mythology, Hippocamp is a half fish, half horse creature. 

It's related to Hippocampus, which is the scientific name for the seahorse, and the name of a major component of the human brain that's seahorse-shaped.

Hippocamp measures about 34 kilometers across, and is 1/1000th the mass of Proteus, which at 418 kilometers across is Neptune's largest inner satellite.

The small moon was observed to be orbiting unusually close to Proteus, even though such a large moon should have gravitationally swept it aside and cleared its orbital path.

In a paper published in the journal Nature, SETI researchers hypothesized that Hippocamp is a fragment of Proteus that broke off following a collision with a comet billions of years ago. 3785073]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[USA / FRANCE — NASA and the European Space Agency are joining forces to research an asteroid system.

The ESA's Hera spacecraft will be the first to explore an asteroid system named 65803 Didymos. According to the space agency, Didymos measures 780 meters across. The asteroid system, is its orbiting moonlet Didymoon which is only 160 meters in width.

According to an ESA news release, the Hera spacecraft will research the crater formed 
by the DART experiment in 2026. It collect data pertaining to the shape and dimensions of the DART crater, as well as surface samples. Hera will also use thermal imaging technology to examine the asteroid's structure. If the mission is successful, this moonlet will be the smallest asteroid ever visited by any spacecraft.

Prior to that, NASA will conduct its first planetary defense mission. According to the space agency, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, will crash into the surface of Didymoon in 2022. NASA is aiming to change the speed and direction of the asteroid system with this test. 3784864]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[DIAMNIADIO, SENEGAL — Senegal is building a $2 billion futuristic city just 40 kilometers away from its capital, reports Quartz.

Senegal's President, Macky Sall is planning on building a 2 billion dollar futuristic city in the Diamniadio township called Diamniadio Lake City. This development project is part of his government's 'Plan for an Emerging Senegal'.

The new project will be built 40 kilometers from the capital city of Dakar. The Diamniadio project aims to promote economic growth.

The city will cover roughly 1,644 hectares. It will be divided into four sections containing various facilities including, a university for 30,000 students, an industrial park, and housing for roughly 350,000 people.

According to Senegalese officials, the project is being financed by investments from private companies through public-private partnerships. China has also pledged to invest roughly $105 million dollars in the second industrial phase of the project.

Renderings of Diamniadio Lake City by the architecture company in charge of the design show a shiny metropolis seemingly straight out of a sci-fi movie.

However, citizens of Diamniadio claim that the compensation the government is offering them for unofficially-owned lands is not enough. 3784841]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — Millions of Chinese citizens have now been banned from traveling by air or train as the government continues to expand its social credit system, the South China Morning Post reports.

China is rolling out a social credit system that assigns personal trustworthiness points to its citizens as a way to monitoring the public and businesses.

Credit history, contract obligation fulfillment, character traits, behavior, preferences and interpersonal relationships are all considered when assigning a credit score, according to Reuters.

Trustworthy individuals are to be provided with more access to society, while individuals who are blacklisted will be severely restricted, Reuters reports.

An official blacklist released by China's National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System has also banned more than 3.59 million Chinese businesses in 2018 from accessing financial markets, issuing corporate bonds or taking part in land auctions.

About 17.46 million people were not allowed to purchase airline tickets, while 5.47 million weren't allowed to buy tickets for high-speed trains, according to the blacklist.

The South China Morning Post cites the blacklist as saying individuals and business were punished for behaviors such as failing to repay loans, false or misleading advertising, or defrauding customers.

China plans to fully implement its social credit system by 2020. 3784811]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[How Zion Williamson's Nike kicks fell apart 3785866]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA — Duke University basketball star Zion Williamson had a footwear malfunction on national TV, just 36 seconds into the Wednesday night game against rival North Carolina.

The footwear in question were Nike PG 2.5s from OKC Thunder player Paul George's signature collection.

According to SB Nation, the PG 2.5s were described on the Nike website as light yet strong, with a supportive strap and designed for the game's most versatile players. So how exactly did it break down?

According to the Raleigh News & Observer, shoes have three major parts. The upper consists of the tongue, toe box, and whatever material is used to engulf the foot.

A thin piece of cloth called the strobel connects the upper to the second part, the midsole, which is made up of plastic and foam to provide cushioning. Third is the rubber bottom called the outsole, which provides grip and traction.

Basketball shoe designer Jesse Rademacher told the News & Observer that Zion Williamson's Nike shoe appeared to come apart where the strobel is stitched to the upper.

The shoe breakdown resulted in a knee sprain for Williamson.

A sneaker expert interviewed by Inside Edition claims the strobel and midsole of Nike's PG 2.5 shoe model are bound together only by glue. He believes this adhesive came apart, causing Williamson's toe and eventually his entire foot to go through the shoe.

Rademacher says the footwear malfunction may be due to the PG 2.5 being built for Paul George, who, despite having a similar height, is a slimmer and lighter athlete than Williamson.

Williamson is currently projected to be the No. 1 overall pick for the NBA draft in June. Thankfully, USA Today Sport reports that his knee injury was minor, and shouldn't impact his draft stock.

Nike, on the other hand, isn't so lucky. According to CNN, the sports brand's image took a hit from the sneaker snafu, with stocks down more than 1% on Thursday.

Still, analysts predict the damage may not be long-term, especially as the brand is focusing less on basketball sneakers and more on athleisure footwear. 3785866]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[FRANCE — French design company Studio NAB has come up with the idea of creating a large vertical farm called the Superfarm to promote sustainable living.

The Superfarm would be six stories tall, with its topmost layer containing solar panels and wind turbines to produce renewable energy, according to its website.

Level 2 would feature an open terrace with plants such as ginseng, spirulina and aloe vera cultures.

Levels 3 and 4 would be dedicated to insect breeding and algae cultures.

The fifth floor would farm aquatic creatures such as trout and tilapia and young plant cultures, while the sixth story would contain a greenhouse that would include plants such as acai berries and goji berries.

Each floor would have a specific purpose and would work in unison with other floors to create a viable ecosystem.

The goal of the Superfarm is to recreate an ecosystem in an urban environment,according to Studio NAB's website.

This would allow customers to connect directly with product makers and have easier access to farms.

      <video:description><![CDATA[XINJIANG, CHINA — Chinese authorities in Xinjiang are collecting DNA samples along with other biometric data from all residents in the region between the agesof 12 and 65, according to Human Rights Watch. 
According to the New York Times, China is trying to force the country's predominantly Muslim Uighurs to become more subservient to the party. The government has detained up to a million people in re-education camps. 
According to Fortune, part of the surveillance effort is to collect biometric data such as iris scans, fingerprints, voice scans, and DNA.  
According to the New York Times, human right groups and Uighur activists say a comprehensive DNA database could be used to chase down Uighurs who resist conforming to the campaign. 
To improve their DNA tracking and testing capabilities, China's police purchased genetic sequencing equipment from Massachusetts biotechnology firm Thermo Fisher Scientific. 
Chinese authorities also used genetic material from people around the world that was provided by prominent Yale University geneticist, Kenneth Kidd, to compare to Uighur DNA. 
According to the New York Times, on Wednesday, Thermo Fisher said it would no longer sell its equipment in Xinjiang. 
According to Dr. Kidd, he was unaware how his material and expertise were being used. He said he thought Chinese scientists were acting within scientific norms that require informed consent by DNA donors. 
According to China's official propaganda agency Xinhua nearly 36 million people in Xinjiang took part in the program called Physicals for All from 2016 to 2017. 3785663]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON — New research from ESA and NASA show the real size of Earth's geocorona. 

New observations from a study by the European Space Agency and NASA show that Earth's geocorona, an atmospheric layer made of hydrogen atoms, reaches up to 630,000 kilometers or 391,000 miles away. 

That is the equivalent of 50 times the Earth's diameter and double the distance to the Moon.

According to the paper published in AGU's Journal of Geophysical Research, the team made these observations using an instrument mounted on a satellite called the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO.

The SOHO orbits some 1.5 million kilometers from Earth towards the Sun and mainly studies Earth's interactions with the Sun. 

It is equipped with a remote tool called Solar Wind Anisotropies, or SWAN. The SWAN is capable of detecting hydrogen signatures in the outer layer of Earth's atmosphere by using an absorption cell.

These new findings could help researchers look for watery planets with similar atmospheres outside of our solar system.

When you think of it, this means astronauts and spacecraft that have traveled to the Moon technically never left the Earth's atmosphere. Pretty neat, right? 3785476]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[CARACAS — U.S. and Russia rush to deliver aid to Venezuela in attempt to further their political agendas, according to NPR and AP reports.

Over the past weeks, U.S. trucks carrying aid have arrived in the Colombia-Venezuela border at the request of Juan Guaido who has been recognized by the U.S. and Canada among others as interim president of Venezuela.

According to NPR, the aid has since been rejected by Maduro's government who has blocked the main border bridge with trucks. Maduro claims this aid is yet another attempt for the U.S. to intervene in local politics.

AP reports that last Wednesday Russian shipments of aid had arrived in Venezuela under the protection of the World Health Organization. According to El Periodico, Nicolas Maduro confirmed the delivery of 300 tons of medical aid from Russia.

Puerto Rico and Brazil have announced that they too will be sending supplies to Venezuela with Puerto Rico promising 250 tons of aid. None have addressed how they will deliver the supplies.

Meanwhile, the U.N. has criticized this stand-off. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York, humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives. 3785966]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ANQING, CHINA — A Lucky Air flight had some bad luck after a guy chucked a few coins at the engine before the flight for good luck. 

According to a Lucky Air Weibo post, Flight 8L9960 from Anqing to Kunming on Feb. 17 had to be scrapped after ground crew found two coins on the ground near the left engine. 
After the crew made an announcement, a 28-year-old male passenger named Lu ratted on himself and said he had tossed the coinage at the plane to keep the flight safe. 
The flight was immediately canceled with all 162 passengers minus Lu having to wait until the following day to be rebooked for flights to Kunming.  
Lu was detained by the airport authorities. Lucky Air says the fortunate incident cost them twenty grand and have said they plan to take legal action against Lu. 
Funny thing is, this isn't even the first time this has happened. According to the Weibo article, this is at least number four, which everyone knows in Chinese is super lucky.
The Lucky Air post then actually went on to explain the importance of engines and why they are allergic to coins—yikes. 3787117]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[China mad at Taiwan game Devotion's Xi Jinping easter egg 3787111]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING —  Chinese gamers have mass downvoted a Taiwanese game over a hidden meme of Xi Jinping, reports Spiel Times.

On February 20, Taiwan developer Red Candle Games released its second horror game, 'Devotion' receiving fairly positive reviews. Things quickly went south when players discovered an 'easter egg' that referenced the popular Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh meme disguised in a seemingly unrelated poster within the game.

An avalanche of bad Steam reviews from Chinese netizens came shortly after the discovery. Focus Taiwan reports the game is no longer available on Steam in China.

According to Eurogamer, Chinese players aren't mad about the meme itself but mostly upset about being 'tricked' into playing a game that mocked their leader and their country. According to SushiReese, a user on a gaming forum called ResetEra, there are more hidden political metaphors in the game. 

For example, he claims the name of a cult mentioned in the game called 'Lùxīnhuì' translates to Mainland heart association which, according to him, means the association of people that are in favor of PRC.

Red Candle Games has since issued a public apology saying, We deeply regret and are awfully sorry for the sensitive art material, and that when the incident first came out, we failed to put ourselves into your position. 

They also explained that they discovered the hidden message after receiving a report from a player a day after the release. They claim to have quickly changed the artwork but it was too late. According to the statement, Red Candle Games partners have cut ties with them. And that's more than likely because those partners, Indievent and Winking Entertainment, are based in China. 3787111]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[THE PRIVACY INVADING SKIES — Some planes operated by American Airlines, United Airlines and Singapore Airlines have cameras preinstalled in seat-back entertainment systems. 
According to Buzzfeed News, a passenger on a Singapore flight posted a photo of his seat-back display with the camera on Feb. 17.  
According to the Associated Press, American, United and Singapore all said last Friday that they have never activated the cameras and have no plans to use them. 
According to an American Airlines spokesman, entertainment system companies have been installing the cameras to offer future options like seat-to-seat conferencing.  
American's seat-back entertainment systems are manufactured by Panasonic, while Singapore uses Panasonic and Thales, according to airline representatives. 
American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said cameras are in premium economy seats on 82 Boeing 777 and Airbus A330-200 planes. 
Singapore spokesman James Boyd said cameras are on 84 Airbus A350s, Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s and 787s. 3787107]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Facebook is collecting deeply personal info from apps 3787097]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA — You'd think Facebook would've learned by now that hoovering people's personal info without their say-so is going to get them into some hot doo-doo. But apparently not.

A Wall Street Journal report has found that the social media giant has been collecting sensitive personal information from at least 11 popular apps, including  Instant Heart Rate: HR Monitor, Flo Period and Ovulation Tracker, and Realtor.com.

That means Facebook potentially knows your weight, blood pressure, heart rate, your last period, whether you're trying to get pregnant, and even what real estate listings you're looking at.

Typically, users can limit what information apps can access, such as location or contacts. But it seems this doesn't apply to data users enter directly into the app.

In fact, according to the report, users don't need to log into their Facebook accounts, or even be Facebook members for the social network to be able to collect their data.

They have no idea private developers are handing over their info to Facebook, and none of the offending apps provide an option to stop it from being sent.

Facebook responded to the report by saying they require apps to be clear with users about what information is being sent, adding that they prohibit the sending of data regarded as sensitive. Sure.

And yet they provide developers with an analytics tool that lets them check out stats on user activities, so they can then target them with Facebook ads.

Geez Facebook, when will you ever stop? 3787097]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[How Jussie Smollett staged his attack, according to prosecutors 3786975]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[CHICAGO — Three weeks after first claiming he was the victim of a hate crime, Jussie Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report.

USA Today reports that Smollett told cops he was beaten by two masked men on January 29. Smollett said the attackers shouted racial and anti-gay slurs, poured a chemical substance over him, and wrapped a noose around his neck.

But surveillance footage, in-car taxi cameras, receipts, and bank accounts told a different story, according to Chicago investigators, who now say the actor planned the attack.

Court documents indicate that on January 22, Jussie Smollett received a threatening letter at the studio where the show 'Empire' is filmed. It came with a white powdery substance that was later determined to be ibuprofen.

Disappointed by the studio's handling of the letter, the actor met with friend Abel Osundairo and Abel's brother Ola three days later, and asked them to stage an attack on him.

According to prosecutors, Smollett wanted the assault to happen the night of January 28 near his Streeterville apartment. He told Abel to hurt him but not too badly, and Ola to put a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him, and yell, This is MAGA country!

He then gave the brothers $100 to buy rope, gasoline, ski masks, gloves, and red MAGA baseball caps needed for the attack.

On January 27, Smollett drove the brothers to the scene where he wanted the assault to take place, pointing out a surveillance camera that would capture the incident. He instructed them to pour bleach instead of gasoline, and not to bring their cellphones, then gave a $3,500 personal check payable to Abel.

A flight delay on Smollett's part pushed the plan back to 2 a.m. on the 29th. The actor called Abel at 12:49 a.m. once his plane landed. Minutes later, the brothers hailed an Uber, switching to a cab midway that took them three blocks from the scene.

The attack took place on 2:04 a.m. as instructed, though out of view of the camera. The brothers fled the scene afterward, taking a taxi home.

Smollett's manager called to report the incident half an hour later. When police arrived at the actor's apartment, body cams captured him with a rope draped around his neck.

According to NBC, Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson said the Empire actor staged the attack in order to generate publicity, as he was dissatisfied with his salary.

The FBI is also investigating Smollett's involvement in the threatening letter he received the week before his assault, for which he could be facing federal charges. 3786975]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Epic Games takes unofficial 'Fortnite Live' festival organizer to court 3786917]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[NORWICH, ENGLAND — Fortnite pubIisher Epic Games is suing an event management company after they unofficially put together a disastrous festival called 'Fortnite Live', reports The Guardian. 

Last Sunday, 2,800 kids and a number of parents paid to attend an epically disappointing 'Fortnite Live' event in Norwich, England and now the real Fornite is taking the event organizers to court.

General tickets to enter the festival cost roughly USD$16 and all-access tickets including special attractions cost USD$26. 

What attractions would they have access too?

According to Geek, they could climb a small mountain (something we are pretty sure they could do for free), take archery lessons (four kids at a time only — remember we said there were 2,800 attendees?), crawl through a 'cave' (which was basically a toppled container covered in fake 'vines') and pay to play Fortnite. 

Epic has since decided to take legal actions against Exciting Events Limited, the family-run company behind the not-so-exciting Fortnite Live festival. 

An Epic Games spokesperson told Eurogamer, The quality of our player experience is incredibly important to us, whether it's inside the game or at official public events like last year's Fortnite Pro-Am. 

Exciting Events Limited has since issued a public apology explaining the mayhem on their website saying, We hadn't held an event like it before and clearly made mistakes, mainly not expecting every ticket holder to arrive at the same time, which caused long queues and understandable frustration. 3786917]]></video:description>

      <video:title><![CDATA[Chinese babies' brains could've been impacted by gene-editing 3786901]]></video:title>
      <video:description><![CDATA[USA / CHINA — New research from UCLA has shown that removing the gene CCR5, could potentially be linked to enhancing one's ability to learn and form memories.

Last year, in November, a Chinese scientist allegedly used CRISPR, a gene-editing tool, to create the world's first gene-edited babies. He Jiankui said he altered the babies' DNA to remove a gene called CCR5, according to a Associated Press report from the time. This would make the twin baby girls immune to HIV. 

New research, published in the journal Cell, people who lack CCR5 were found to have better cognition and were also found to recover faster from strokes. The researchers tested their theory on mice. They altered the DNA of the mice to remove CCR5. This was found to enhance animals' intelligence.

The scientists connected their findings to the Chinese twins. Researcher Alconi J.Silva explained the gene-modification performed on them likely affected their brains. The simplest interpretation is that those mutations will probably have an impact on cognitive function in the twins, Silva explained, according to MIT Technology Review.

Follow up studies about CCR5 are already taking place at UCLA, with participants being given Maraviroc, an HIV treatment , to see if it improves cognition.  Silva said that altering CCR5 was found to have big effects. Silva added that we are not ready for the consequences we could potentially face for mutating DNA. 3786901]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[JACKSON COUNTY, GEORGIA — A 79-year-old woman in Georgia noticed a home intruder and decided to exercise her Second Amendment rights.

Gwendolyn Agard was at home when she heard a burglar entering her house by shattering the glass on the second floor.

According to WSB-TV Atlanta, Agard immediately grabbed her gun and called 911. She then started yelling at the man and firing shots at him.

The 79-year-old told WSB-TV she yelled an expletive at the guy, and said quote, I'm going to blow your damn brains out. Agard said she missed but she ended up frightening the guy.

The intruder was believed to have hidden in the bedroom closet on the second floor till the police arrived, WSB-TV reports.

The 79-year-old told the TV station she was trembling and asked the Lord to have mercy on her, while yelling expletives at the same time.

WSB-TV has named the suspect as Hans Rogers, a 20-year-old man, who now faces charges of home invasion. 3786812]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MOON — With climate change, nuclear warfare, and flat earthers looming on the horizon, Earth's not exactly the safest place to store the records of human civilization. So it's being sent to the moon instead.

CNET reports that when the Beresheet lunar lander was launched on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket Thursday, it was carrying a disc encoded with a 30-million-page archive of human history and civilization, dubbed the Lunar Library.

Created by the Arch Mission Foundation, the Lunar Library is a DVD-sized archive composed of 25 nickel film discs that are each only 40 microns thick.

According to the foundation, the first four layers contain over 60,000 analog images of documents, photos, books, and illustrations that can be seen with a low-powered microscope. Letters on these layers are the size of a bacillus bacterium.

The 21 digital layers beneath are encoded with 200 GB of information, as well as images, audio, video and software.

This includes a complete copy of the English-language Wikipedia and the PanLex datasets, which is a linguistic key to 5,000 languages.

The AMF had previously placed a test archive on Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster that was launched to Mars orbit aboard the Falcon Heavy rocket.

According to CNET, there's also a solid-state copy of Wikipedia on a cubesat from SpaceChain that's currently in low-Earth orbit. 3787704]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW — Kalashnikov, the company behind the AK-47, has created a new kind of drone.

The drone, called KYB-UAV, is 4-feet wide, according to Intelligent Aerospace. Citing a Russian language Kalashnikov news release, the Washington Post reports that the device can fly at a speed of 130 kilometers per hour for 30 minutes.

The drone can also carry a payload of explosives weighing up to 3 kg of while flying. Intelligent Aerospace reports that the device can be sent to its target via payload targeting image or by manually inputting the coordinates.

The National Interest also quotes a Kalashnikov news release as saying that the drone, is designed to destroy remote ground targets.

The Russian-made drone would be low-priced and widely available, The Washington Post reports.

      <video:description><![CDATA[PASADENA, CALIFORNIA — If the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere continue to rise, according to a new study, stratocumulus clouds may disappear and cause Earth's temperatures to climb sharply. 

According to the study, stratocumulus clouds cover 20 percent of tropical oceans and critically affect Earth's energy balance by reflecting 30-60 percent of shortwave radiation back into space. 

Researchers from the California Institute of Technology ran detailed simulations of cloud formation and the effects solar radiation had on them. Their results were published in the journal Nature. 
Scientists modeled a small patch of sky using a supercomputer to run simulations, and found that if carbon dioxide levels reach about 1,200 parts per million, or ppm, in the atmosphere, stratocumulus clouds break up.

Currently, atmospheric carbon dioxide is around 410 ppm, however if the current trend of releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere continues at this pace, the Earth could reach 1,200 ppm in 100 to 150 years.  

The resulting loss of stratocumulus clouds could lead to an increase in temperature of 14 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius).  
More research will need to be carried out as the data from the study has not yet been replicated. 3787618]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[HANOI, VIETNAM — North Korea's rocket man set off on a lengthy train ride to Vietnam on Saturday to meet his frenemy Orangina.

According to the BBC, Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump will meet in Hanoi for the second US-North Korea summit, where they are expected to continue denuclearization talks.

Russia's TASS news agency, citing a North Korean diplomatic source, said Kim left Pyongyang in an armored train at 5 p.m. on February 23.

Reuters reports that two witnesses in Dandong spotted the train crossing from North Korea into China via the Yalu river bridge at around 9:30 p.m.

Kim's 21-car train bears a striking resemblance to the armored train his late father Kim Jong Il used to visit allies in China and Russia. According to the Chosun Ilbo, the locomotive contains a conference room, an audience chamber, and bedrooms, and is fitted with satellite phone connections and a flat screen TV.

While a plane ride will take only a few hours, the New York Times reports that Kim's journey by rail can take as long as two days.

The train is expected to stop at the Vietnamese border station of Dong Dang, where the North Korean leader will disembark and go the remaining 170 kilometers to Hanoi by car.

The summit is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, with three sources confirming to Reuters that the preferred location is the Government Guesthouse in central Hanoi. 3787403]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[THE FRIENDLY SKIES — A Korean mother traveling with a 4-month-old infant on a ten hour flight from Seoul to San Francisco clearly has being a mom down already. 
According to a Facebook post by passenger Dave Corona on February 13, this mom of the millenium handed out more than 200 goodie bags filled with all the essentials in case her baby does what babies often do on flights. 
The bags were filled with yummy candies, ear plugs and a super cute note attached. 

The note said hello, I'm Junwoo and I'm 4 months old. Today, I am going to the U.S. with my mom and grandmom to see my aunt. I'm a little bit nervous and scary because it's my first flight in my life, which means that I may cry or make too much noise. I will try to go quietly, though I can't make any promises. Please excuse me. So my mom prepared little goodie bag for you! It has some candies and earplugs. Please use it when it's too noisy because of me. Enjoy your trip. Thank you.

It's safe to say this woman wins at momming. And according to Corona, not a peep out of the kid for the entire flight to SF. 
So clearly the lesson of the day is that the next time you see a mother traveling with small kids—immediately demand your goodie bag. 3788341]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[NORTH KOREA — Kim Jong Un has brutally purged 421 officials since coming to power in 2010, according to a report by the Seoul-based North Korean Strategy Center. 
According to Radio Free Asia, the report titled Executions and Purges of North Korean Elites: An Investigation into Genocide Based on High-Ranking Officials' Testimonies was released on Feb. 22. 
The NKSC collected accounts from 14 North Korean defectors, six North Korean officials in China, and five other defectors who witnessed executions. 

The investigation found Kim had his own uncle offed in 2013 because he sold the country's resources to foreign countries at a low price. 
In 2017, Fats had his half-brother Jong-nam rubbed out at a Malaysian airport. 
The report only stuck to confirmed cases and listed the full names of more than 50 purged officials, while confirming hundreds more were no longer with us, but did not provide names.   
The study also detailed nine of Fatty's favorite purging methods like hanging, feeding birthday suit only prisoners to hungry animals, and execution via anti-aircraft cannons or flamethrowers. 
The timing of the report came out just in time as Sunkist meets with Fats for their second summit in Hanoi, Vietnam. 
But don't worry, Orangina won't let inconvenient truths like facts get in the way of his pathetic praise for one of the world's most brutal dictators. 3788304]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[BEIJING — Chinese authorities are testing a new system that analyzes people's walks, reports the South China Morning Post. 

Chinese police are testing a new technology called 'gait recognition' that analyzes live videos and stores data of how a person walks.

The system was developed by Watrix, a Chinese artificial intelligence start-up. They claim the program can detect someone's walk from 50 meters away regardless of whether they are facing the camera.

It does this by creating silhouettes of people in videos and studying their body contour, their arm movement while walking, whether they have a toe-in or a toe-out gait, among other elements. All these components allow them to identify each person's unique 'walking style.' 

Authorities in the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing are among the cities that have already tried the product. The newest version of the program is able to analyze live camera feeds of megacities. 3788255]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS — An investigation by The Verge sheds a light on the working conditions of Facebook content moderators. 

A recent investigation by Casey Newton for The Verge explored the job of Facebook's so-called 'content moderators.' The social network relies on these contractors to moderate its platform and rid it of explicit content.

The social media giant has roughly 15,000 content moderators, most of which are outsourced from other digital service companies. Cognizant is one such company. Chloe, a Cognizant ex-employee, told The Verge she suffers from severe anxiety after watching a man being stabbed to death.

Some employees continue to experience PTSD-like symptoms and secondary traumatic effects long after leaving Cognizant but they are not eligible for support from them or Facebook itself once they've left.

Although they keep Facebook clean at the cost of their mental health, these moderators make just $28,800 per year. Citing data from Glassdoor, an April 2017 Business Insider report says the media pay at  Facebook is roughly $240,000 per year. 3788252]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[ANTARCTICA —  NASA satellite images show two cracks running across the  Antarctic Brunt Ice Shelf which could break off into a 1,700 kilometer-iceberg. 

Images taken by NASA show a northward expanding crevice, named Chasm 1 by the British Antarctic Survey, stretching across the Antarctic Brunt Ice Shelf and a smaller crevice called Halloween crack, inching closer to the edge of the ice shelf. 

The two cracks are just 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles from each other. 

When these two rifts meet, an iceberg twice the size of New York City will break off of the shelf. NASA predicts the resulting mass of the iceberg could cover 1,700 kilometers or 660 square miles. This would make it the largest iceberg to break away from the Brunt Ice Shelf in over a century.

According to the Natural Environment Research Council, this phenomenon is called iceberg calving. Calving occurs when large portions of ice break off from glaciers or the margins of ice shelves.

Data from the Natural Environment Research Council show that these shifts have forced British researchers working at the Halley Research Station to relocate. There have been six Halley stations built so far.

This iceberg is, in fact, next-level ginormous but NASA says it probably doesn't even reach the top 20 biggest icebergs in history. Can you imagine the size of those? 3788081]]></video:description>

      <video:description><![CDATA[TAIPEI — A cat burglar pulled off a near purr-fect caper by sneaking two Persian cats out of Taoyuan Airport, stuffing them under her shirt to make it look like she was preggers. 

According to Apple Daily, security camera footage viewed by po po shows 35-year-old Li Yanting from Hong Kong leaving an airport bathroom with a baby bump she didn't have when she went in. 
Li then strolled the security check without so much as a meow from the little ones.  
Apparently, the police were tipped off after Chang Chinyi, a cat breeder in Taipei, found that two of her expensive Persian kittens had been cat-napped by Li. 
According to Chang, Li wanted to buy three Persian cats from Chang, so on four different occasions, came to Taipei to stay with Chang to learn how to care for the cats. 
But after a few visits, Chang realized Li just wanted to buy some expensive felines, but not take care of them, so she refused to sell her the Persians.
So, how did Li take it? She broke into Chang's apartment and stole two of the kittens, then hightailed it back to Hong Kong.
Chang was able to get a hold of Li over Messenger, and after some back and forth, got Li to admit to the kitty caper and agree to return them to one of Chang's friends in HK. 3787989]]></video:description>
