      <title>Sumter Woman Arrested for Licking Hands and Touching Items</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Sumter, North Carolina <br/> A woman has been arrested after video footage emerged of her licking her hands and touching items in a restaurant and grocery store. <br/><br/>On Saturday, Sumter Police were called to an IGA grocery store on a report of a suspicious person. Police found the woman, 38-year-old Shenir Gibson Holliday in the parking lot and determined she matched the description of the woman wanted by Sumter County deputies.<br/><br/>According to WIS News, when they looked at the surveillance video inside the store, officers said it showed her licking her hands and coughing before pulling on freezer doors and touching food items; the video also showed her doing the same thing in the dry food section. <br/><br/>The arrest comes after the Sheriff's Office put out a red alert looking for a woman that matched Holliday's description who licked her hands before touching things at a Sub Station II. <br/><br/>In that incident, a woman wearing sunglasses and a low-zipped Champion jumpsuit entered the restaurant and ordered food and a drink, but not before licking her fingers with her tongue. <br/><br/>According to the deputies' report, the woman licked her fingers as she was getting the money to give to the cashier.<br/><br/>Deputies said as her sub was being made, the woman licked her palm and rubbed her hand over the store's debit machine; she was also seen licking quarters and putting them in the tip jar before she left the store without her food.<br/><br/>As the woman left the store, she confessed, 'It's in God's hands now.<br/><br/>Police charged Holliday with aggravated breach of peace and food tampering and gave her a citation for a violation of the state's 'home or work' order.<br/><br/>The Sheriff's Office also charged her with aggravated breach of peace and food tampering for the Sub Station II incident.<br/><br/>On Sunday, her bond was set at $100,000 and she was ordered to undergo testing for COVID-19.<br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Covidiot Cuts Hole in Mask to Breathe Easier</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY <br/> A Kentucky woman was filmed out shopping with a hole cut in her face mask because it made it ' easier to breathe.'<br/><br/>The footage posted on TikTok showed a gas station worker in Lexington totally bemused by the woman as she casually waltzes about the store with a gash down the center of her mask, rendering it useless. <br/><br/>As the woman approaches the counter, the clerk mockingly questions her, 'where did you get that mask from?'<br/><br/>She replies, 'well, since we have to wear them and it makes it hard to breathe, this makes it a lot easier to breathe.'<br/><br/>The clerk then says, 'cutting it? Yeah, I'll do that too, thanks for the advice.'<br/><br/>The footage, which has received more than 900,000 likes since Friday, comes after Kentucky Governor. Andy Beshear announced that shoppers will be requested to wear masks while in public starting May 11th.<br/><br/>According to the Louisville Courier-Journal, he said, 'While it's gonna seem strange and is probably uncomfortable, I want us to know that this is just another small sacrifice that we can make to make sure that we keep each other safe.'<br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>5-year-old  in Utah pulled over by highway patrol</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OGDEN, UTAH <br/>  A five-year-old was pulled over by highway patrol while he was on his way to California to buy himself a Lamborghini. <br/><br/>A five-year-old Utah kid threw, potentially, the most dramatic and, at the same time, impressive tantrum ever. He drove his parents' car onto the highway and planned to drive himself to California. Why? Well, cause that's what you do when your parents don't want to buy you a Lambo. Yep. You heard that right.<br/><br/>According to the Utah Highway Patrol, the story starts when the kid had asked his parents for the thing all 5-year-olds want, a Lamborghini. Welp, let's just say that mom was not too keen on the idea.<br/><br/>So mini-Toretto decided that with or without mom's permission, he would go ahead and fulfill his dream. So, naturally, the kid somehow got in the family car and drove himself onto Interstate 15.<br/><br/>His plan kinda fell through very quickly because soon after he hit the road he was stopped by highway patrol trooper Rick Morgan after he spotted the kiddo zigzagging across the road at 30 miles per hour.<br/><br/>Now imagine watching a driver you stop roll down their window only to find a child sitting in the driver's seat. The kid told the officer he had left home after quarreling with mom and was headed to Cali to get himself a Lambo, he had the money for it too <br/> three dollars to be exact. <br/><br/>Good news is, no one was hurt in the kid's brave quest for a Lamborghini. Apparently, the little dude was left under the not-so-careful observation of his siblings. Clearly that didn't work.]]></description>

      <title>Father and Son Charged for Murder of Ahmaud Arbery</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRUNSWICK, GEORGIA <br/> According to The Baltimore Sun, on February 23, Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was running inside the Satilla Shores neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia when Gregory McMichael, 64, who was standing in his front yard, noticed him.<br/><br/>Gregory believed Arbery looked like a man responsible for several break-ins in the neighborhood so he notified his son, 34-year-old Travis McMichael. They both got into a white pickup truck to go after Arbery. They were carrying a .357 Magnum and a shotgun, respectively.<br/><br/>The father and son then proceeded to chase Arbery, stopping their vehicle in front of the road at which point Arbery ran around the pickup truck.<br/><br/>Video footage believed to be shot by William Bryan, a third individual participating in the pursuit, shows Travis McMichaels holding a shotgun while having a physical altercation with Arbery. Three shots can be heard. Arbery succumbed from his wounds.]]></description>

      <title>Alabama Cop Body-Slams Woman for Not Wearing a Mask</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA <br/> Inside a Walmart on Tuesday an off-duty police officer was caught on camera body-slamming a woman after an altercation broke out because cops say she wasn't wearing a mask.  <br/><br/>In the video, the officer places the woman in handcuffs as she begins to wriggle away from him; he then grapples the woman, lifts her up, and slams her to the floor face first. <br/><br/>According to the Birmingham Police Department, a Walmart employee had asked the woman to wear a face mask, but she allegedly grew angry and attracted the attention of the officer.<br/><br/>They also said they're investigating the use of force by the officer, who was, in fact, working a side gig as a security guard for the store. <br/><br/>The woman has yet to be identified but does face charges for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, third-degree criminal trespassing, possession of marijuana, and unlawful possession of a controlled substance.<br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Dennis Rodman Hung Out With 'Hotties' With Kim Jong-un</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S. <br/> In a new interview on Mike Tyson's Hot Boxin' podcast last Thursday, 48-year-old Dennis Rodman who has acted as an ambassador between North Korea and the States recalled his first visit to the supreme ruler's regime and how they hung out with 'hotties.'  <br/><br/>Dennis said, 'I'm thinking I'm going to do an autograph show or play basketball. I ain't know anything about North Korea, stupid as f**k right?'<br/><br/>The retired NBA player continued: 'When I first met him, I was with the Harlem Globetrotters and I wasn't playing so some of the dignitaries asked me to come with them.' <br/><br/>Kim Jong-un actually first asked Dennis's former Chicago Bulls teammate Michael Jordan to fly out but the legend himself refused. <br/><br/>Dennis went on to say, 'We sat there talking about basketball the whole time. The game's over and we go into a room then he says, "We'd love you to come back, we enjoy your company. Let's have dinner tonight, a little karaoke, and have some vodka, some hotties" and stuff like that.' <br/><br/>Staying true to his promise, Dennis revealed, 'Next thing I know, we are having dinner and we are drunk as s**t, he starts singing karaoke and I have no clue what the f**k he's talking about.' <br/><br/>'Everyone starts clapping and then he has this 18-piece women's band come out and these girls are hot but they just played one song. Just one f*****g song. It was the theme from Dallas. He said, "that's all we know."'<br/><br/>Dennis also stated that while he's 'good friends' with Jong-un, he 'doesn't get involved' with politics.<br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Covidiot Inmates Caught Sniffing a Mask</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES <br/> Inmates of a California jail have been caught on surveillance video trying to intentionally infect themselves with coronavirus. <br/><br/>In the video, the inmates from a Los Angeles County jail can be seen sniffing a mask and drinking from the same water bottle.<br/><br/>Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters at a news conference that the 'deeply disturbing' behavior resulted in at least 21 inmates testing positive for COVID-19 within a week. <br/><br/>One of the videos shared by the sheriff on Monday shows an inmate using a hot-water dispenser to fill a plastic bottle and then passing it around as multiple men take swigs from it.<br/><br/>The Sheriff said, 'under normal circumstances, no one would do that anyway, particularly when everyone has the same access to the water and to all the different supplies.'<br/><br/>The biological self-harm was a calculated attempt to raise their body temperatures because it happened moments before the nurse went to check on them. <br/><br/>in a different unit within the facility, another group of inmates were seen sniffing a mask and sharing hot water from a Styrofoam cup; which the sheriff said was sad to see people 'deliberately try to expose themselves to COVID-19.' <br/><br/>The incidents took place in mid-April inside the facility's day rooms, a common area where inmates can hang out and make phone calls.<br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

Because I lift in the gym I can carry the heavy ladders and I can work with the hose.<br/><br/>Vince landed his job at the Greensburg Fire Department in 2007, aged just 15-year-old as a junior firefighter, after three years of rigorous training he earned his stripes as a senior firefighter at the age of 18.<br/><br/>Vince said, 'I have always had a positive attitude, but even still, I have achieved things that were beyond my wildest dreams when I was a teenager. 'I have been ambitious and I want to show other people who is different that you can be whoever you want to be in life.'<br/><br/>Vince has documented his journey to a chiseled body on Instagram and has gained almost 40,000 followers thanks to his inspirational posts all about health and fitness regime. <br/><br/>And according to Vince, he has received word from Guinness that he will be crowned as the World Record holder for being the world's shortest firefighter in the 2021 edition, to which he said, 'It's a great feeling of course and it will be made official soon.'<br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Tara Reade Tells Megyn Kelly How Biden Attacked Her</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON <br/> On May 9, Tara Reade, who is now accusing Joe Biden of assault and worked under Biden's office in 1992, shared her testimony in an interview with Megyn Kelly where she detailed the series of events that lead to the alleged assault. <br/><br/>Last spring, a total of eight women came forward accusing Joe Biden of inappropriate touching. In late March of this year, one of these women, Tara Reade, decided to come forth and tell her full story in a podcast interview with Katie Halper.<br/><br/>But Reade's testimony goes far beyond 'inappropriate' touching. Reade told Halper that Biden had penetrated her using his fingers.<br/><br/>In an interview with Megyn Kelly published on YouTube on May 9, Tara Reade recalls being sexually harassed during her time as a staff assistant in Biden's Senate office in 1993. She told Megyn that Biden would sometimes put his hand on the back of her neck and stroke it.<br/><br/>When recalling the instance of sexual assault, Reade claims she was asked to hand then-Senator Biden a gym bag in the Russell Senate Office building. She says that this is when Biden pushed hair against a wall and slid his hand under her skirt. Reade states that he then used his fingers to penetrate her.<br/><br/>Reade goes on to say that Biden was whispering vulgar words to her at the same time. Reade says that Biden pulled away when she did not respond to his advances and then pointed his finger at her saying, 'You're nothing to me.'<br/><br/>Reade recalls Biden shaking her by the shoulders and telling her 'You're alright' when he noticed she was unsettled.<br/><br/>This isn't the first time Reade recalls an alleged assault while working for Biden. According to court documents from March 25, 1996, obtained by The San Luis Obispo Tribune, Reade's ex-husband, Theodore Dronen, states that Reade had told him about problems she was having at work 'regarding sexual harassment, in U.S. Senator Joe Biden's office.'<br/><br/>The declaration goes on to say, 'Petitioner told me that she eventually struck a deal with the chief of staff of the Senator's office and left her position.'<br/><br/>On top of that, in an interview with The Intercept, Reade also recalls her mother making an anonymous call to the Larry King Live show where she mentions Reade's situation.<br/><br/>According to The Intercept, someone who heard the Katie Halper podcast found video footage of that call. The Larry King Live episode aired on August 11, 1993. The program was called Washington: The Cruelest City on Earth?. Here's how the call went.<br/><br/>Reade has confirmed to The Intercept that the caller's voice is indeed her mother's and property records also show that her mother was living in San Luis Obispo County.<br/><br/>Joe Biden's campaign has denied these allegations and in an interview on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe', Buden himself says, quote, 'No, it is not true. I'm saying unequivocally it never, never happened.']]></description>

      <title>Trump Brands Himself a 'Warrior' and Goes Without a Mask</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA <br/> Donald Trump has proclaimed himself a 'warrior' on his latest visit to a PPE factory where he was yet again pictured without a mask or gloves.<br/><br/>The President addressed workers at the Owens & Minor plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania on Thursday without any protective equipment, despite his aides covering their face and hands.<br/><br/>After branding himself a 'warrior', he said, 'We are all warriors. Everyone in our country is a warrior.'<br/><br/>'We have to because of what happened. It should have never happened. It should have been stopped at the source.'<br/><br/>Trump rejected PPE during the visit, despite two top White House aides testing positive for COVID-19 last week.<br/><br/>The White House has defended Trump's decision not to wear a face-covering by noting that he is tested daily for coronavirus and has tested negative. Officials argue that face-coverings are intended to prevent infected individuals from spreading the virus, so a mask would be immaterial for someone who is not a carrier.<br/><br/>But these criticisms didn't stop him toting his own trumpet, Trump took the chance to brag, albeit vaguely, his own achievements with increasing production, saying, 'Great things are happening with ventilators.'<br/><br/>The president has not worn a mask on camera to date, even as his own White House has directed officials in the West Wing to wear one when social distancing isn't possible. <br/><br/>And just last week, Trump suddenly remembered he couldn't shake hands so hugged an official on arriving in Phoenix, Arizona, and yet again, wasn't wearing PPE. <br/><br/>The factory from Thursday has sent millions of N95 masks, surgical gowns, and gloves to hospitals around the country, so, let's just hope it doesn't suddenly shut down with an outbreak of COVID-19. <br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Polar Vortex Brings Springtime Snow to U.S. East Coast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON <br/> The polar vortex dumped snow and cold Arctic air on parts of the northeast United States and Canada over Mother's Day weekend, the Associated Press reports.<br/><br/>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the polar vortex is a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole. It is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere.<br/><br/>The polar vortex is usually held in place by a current called the jet stream. Disturbances in the jet stream can push frigid, wintry air to parts of Canada and the U.S., while high-pressure systems of warmer air bulge northwards elsewhere.]]></description>

      <title>Restaurant slammed for 'COVID-19 Surcharge'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WEST PLAINS, MISSOURI <br/> The owners of a Missouri restaurant are pleading with people online to stop abusing their employees after a customer posted a photo of their receipt that showed she was charged a 'COVID 19 surcharge' for a meal.<br/><br/>The disgruntled customer took her frustration to Twitter on May 11 saying, 'Scuse me ... what? A COVID surcharge...?'<br/><br/>The restaurant took to Facebook and explained that the surcharge was applied because of an increase in the price of meat and poultry because of the coronavirus outbreak saying, 'please understand we are not doing this to take advantage of you guys!'<br/><br/>They added, 'We are doing this hoping we can adjust the surcharge weekly rather than just raise all of our prices on our menu due to increased prices from our supplier on meat, poultry, seafood & produce.'<br/><br/>Meat prices in the U.S. have shot up in recent weeks, increasing more than 8% in April.<br/><br/>In response to the backlash, the restaurant said it would take the surcharge off and instead raise their prices across the board. However, it added that it would be offering a 'good promo deal' so customers can 'enjoy our meal with a low cost.'<br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>This melting glacier may cause a 1,000-foot-tall tsunami in Alaska</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANCHORAGE, ALASKA <br/> A melting Alaskan glacier may set off a landslide and trigger a tsunami in Prince William Sound, according to a public letter by climate scientists and geologists at institutions including the University of Alaska, the Ohio State University and the University of British Columbia. <br/><br/>This event could happen as soon as next year and no later than 20 years from now, they say. <br/><br/>The researchers say the Barry Glacier's retreat inland could send its scarp tumbling down the Barry Arm. A complete failure of the scarp will cause a destructive tsunami to crash down Barry Arm and Harriman Fiord, while partially endangering Port Wells.<br/><br/>If the scarp fails completely, it would raise waves as high as 1,000 feet, which would threaten fishing boats and the hundreds of fishermen and tourists who frequent the region. Even locations far from the Barry Glacier may experience 30-foot tall waves.<br/><br/>According to the letter, climate change is melting Barry Glacier, and the retreating ice has left a swath of the cliff unsupported by its mass. The loose scarp then entered into a slow-motion landslide that is now showing signs of speeding up.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists Made Chimera Mice with Most-Ever Human Cells</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON <br/> Scientists have engineered mice that have up to 4 percent of their body made of human cells, or the highest amount achieved in human-mice chimeras, according to a study in Science Advances.<br/><br/>To create the chimeras, scientists took human stem cells and chemically suppressed a protein called mTOR for three hours. This forces the cells to revert back to the 'naive' state, which enables them to grow inside mice embryos.<br/><br/>As the embryos matured, researchers found the tissues that would become the heart, liver and bone marrow to contain human cells, which were also found in the blood. Science News reports the technology may help scientists to use chimeras as a source for human organs.<br/><br/>Scientists did not detect any trace of human material in the cells that would develop into mice sperm or egg. This eliminates ethical concerns of chimeras capable of reproduction.]]></description>

      <title>Rats Are Becoming Aggressive Hunters in Our Absence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ATLANTA <br/> In a new advisory from the Centers For Disease Control And Prevention, they say that in our absence rats and rodents have become more aggressive while scavenging for food.<br/><br/>The CDC said on its website that, 'Community-wide closures have led to a decrease in food available to rodents, especially in dense commercial areas.' <br/><br/>They added that 'some jurisdictions have reported an increase in rodent activity as rodents search for new sources of food.'<br/><br/>The advisory continued with, 'Environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in service requests related to rodents and reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior.'<br/><br/>So, what can we do to defend ourselves from this potential new threat? The CDC urges residents and restaurant owners to seal up holes where hungry rats could get inside and also to clean up any garbage or debris.<br/><br/>Offering official advice, they said 'Follow established guidelines when cleaning up after rodent infestations to prevent exposure to rodent-borne diseases.' <br/><br/>Because we're confined to our homes, our lack of littering has even forced some urban rats to turn to rodent cannibalism.<br/><br/>Bobby Corrigan, an urban rodentologist, told NBC News last month, 'They're mammals just like you and I, and so when you're really, really hungry, you're not going to act the same <br/> you're going to act very bad, usually.'<br/><br/>'So these rats are fighting with one another, now the adults are killing the young in the nest and cannibalizing the pups.'<br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Grieving Dog Refuses to Leave His Sister's Body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KINGSVILLE, TEXAS <br/> A dog named Guardian was found abandoned on the side of a road refusing to leave his sister's body when rescuers arrived to bring them to a shelter and provide aid. <br/><br/>According to a Facebook post by Kingsville Kleberg Health Department Animal Control & Care Center, the animal control officers received a call last Friday morning about a deceased dog near a rural highway.<br/><br/>When they arrived on the scene, responders encountered what they described as a 'heart-wrenching sight.'<br/><br/>The body of the deceased dog was being protected by another dog, a grieving Catahoula mix that has now been given the fitting name, 'Guardian' by staff at the shelter. <br/><br/>In the post from Friday, the animal center said, 'This boy wasn't going to let anyone mess with his sister. Our animal control officers had a hard time convincing him everything was going to be alright, and they were there to help him.'<br/><br/>But it's good news for Guardian! The center said, 'He's still a little confused about what happened, but at least he is now in a safe place with fresh cool water and belly full of food.'<br/><br/>And in an update post from the center, they say they now already have an adoption scheduled at 8:00 am on the day he becomes available, this week on May 29th.<br/><br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>UPDATE: YouTube Automatically Deletes Anti-China Comments</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CALIFORNIA <br/> Last night, we put out a video that tested the claim that YouTube was automatically deleting anti-China comments, and we proved the claim right, they were, and now, YouTube is claiming that it's all just a big misunderstanding. <br/><br/>A YouTube spokesperson told TechCrunch that the auto-deletions were a result of an error in their enforcement systems, one that the company is supposedly looking into.<br/><br/>The spokesperson added, 'Users can report suspected issues to troubleshoot errors and help us make product improvements.'<br/><br/>TechCrunch claims that according to YouTube, the situation is an accidental side effect of the platform's comment moderation system, which is in place to filter out hate speech, harassment, and spam. <br/><br/>However, YouTube did not offer any explanation as to how the terms ended up in the automated system.<br/><br/>The report continues saying that with the vast majority of their workforces out of the office, major tech platforms have leaned more heavily on AI moderation methods in recent months, which results in an all too easy excuse of, less human oversight leads to more mistakes. <br/><br/>With this investigation supposedly underway, we should then see our comments no longer blocked. <br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>VIRAL: Wild 'Karen' Takes a 'Dark Turn' and Calls 911</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MANHATTAN, NEW YORK <br/> 57-year-old, Christian Cooper who was targeted by a so-called 'Karen' in a now-viral clip, says she took a 'dark turn' and called 911 after he simply asked her to follow the rules. <br/><br/>Posted to Facebook on the 25th of May, Christian shared his encounter with the woman now identified as Amy Cooper who called police to say she was being threatened by an 'African American' man because she didn't like his insistence that she should leash her dog.<br/><br/>Christian, a former Marvel Comics Editor and graduate from Harvard University in 1984, said that before he started filming he had asked her to refrain from allowing her dog to tear through the plantings in the Ramble and that her dog should be on a leash, even referring to a sign. <br/><br/>Amy then, before he started filming claimed that the dog runs were closed and that her pup needed his exercise, to which Christian replied, 'All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off-leash all you want.'<br/><br/>Thanks to the video gaining millions of views, Amy Cooper has since been fired from her job at Franklin Templeton after her company reviewed the incident, saying in a statement, 'Following our internal review of the incident in Central Park yesterday, we have made the decision to terminate the employee involved, effective immediately. We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton.'<br/><br/>Adding insult to injury, the Central Park South Civic Association President, Michael Fisher has called on the Mayor to impose a lifetime ban on Amy Cooper ever using the park again. <br/><br/>He said in a statement, 'This disgusting display of intolerance is unacceptable and should never, ever be accepted in the city's public domain like Central Park.'<br/><br/>And furthering her shame, according to the Abandoned Angels Cocker Spaniel Rescue, she 'voluntarily surrendered' her dog on Monday night. <br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.
