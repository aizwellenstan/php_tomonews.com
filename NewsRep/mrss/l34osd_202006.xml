      <title>Thai Man Steals 126 Flip-Flops to Have Sex With Them</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NONTHABURI, THAILAND <br/> A man has been caught with his pants down, stealing his neighbors' flip-flops in order to have sex with them. <br/><br/>The man, identified as 24-year-old Theerapat Klaiya has a fetish for flip-flops and nabbed 126 pairs from his neighbors in Nonthaburi, central Thailand. Officers identified the pervert using footage from CCTV set up outside his latest alleged victim's home. <br/><br/>Investigating officers searched Klaiya's home and discovered his vast collection of stolen footwear, that he claims he has been collecting for more than two years.<br/><br/>He then allegedly told officers that he would wear the flip-flops around his home as it turned him on. He would then cuddle and kiss them, rub them on his naked body and then 'have sex with them.'<br/><br/>Police officials claimed that most of the shoes were worn out and that his collection included dozens of different brands, sizes, and colors.<br/><br/>The vast array of footwear was laid out in front of the Nonthaburi police station as part of a press conference on Monday the 25th last week. <br/><br/>Police said the man admitted to three charges of nighttime theft and snatching, possessing a digital transceiver without permission, and violating the Wuhan virus curfew. Major Colonel Ekkaphop Prasitwattanachai told local media it was not the man's first offense of a similar act.<br/><br/>He said, 'After we arrested the suspect, we also found out that he had already been arrested last year for stealing flip-flops in another district. He fully admitted stealing the sandals for lewd purposes, so he will be detained at the station until a court appearance for prosecutors to decide on the next part of the legal process for him.'<br/><br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Train Forced to Stop Because of Arrogant Chinese Woman</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ZIYANG, SICHUAN, CHINA <br/> A woman in Sichuan province brought a train to a halt with nothing more than her own carelessness. <br/><br/>Footage from Pear Video shows a woman of about 40-years-old on the 2nd of June waltz across a railroad in the city of Ziyang whilst nattering on the phone, her negligence for her surroundings forced the train to actually stop. <br/><br/>The lax woman, despite the cries of train workers continues to walk on the tracks until finally responding to yells from people waiting at the crossing. She casually steps off the tracks and, you guessed it, continues talking on the phone. <br/><br/>According to Pear Video, this section of the track is primarily used for transporting goods and, fortunately for the woman, usually runs at a slower speed. <br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Chinese Guy Shoots Himself in the Chest With Crossbow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NANNING, GUANGXI, CHINA <br/> A Chinese man can consider himself extremely lucky after he accidentally shot himself in the chest with a crossbow, narrowly missing his heart. <br/><br/>Citing a post on Chinese Twitter knock-off, Weibo, which has now received over half a million views, the so-far-unnamed man was filmed on the 6th of June with a bolt sticking out of his chest and actually poking out of the other side. The man can be seen held up, almost in display as he likely reconsiders his life. <br/><br/>The source claims that he was practicing archery at home when he accidentally shot himself.<br/><br/>Incredibly, doctors said that he missed his heart by a mere one centimeter and that, obviously, he is incredibly lucky to be alive. <br/><br/>Fortunately for the man, the arrow was successfully removed during a much needed emergency operation. The man is now recovering from his piercing wound and hopefully recovering from when he landed on his head at birth.<br/><br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI <br/> Taiwan's air force scrambled planes to warn off "multiple" Chinese fighter jets that had briefly entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone on June 9, the country's Ministry of National Defense said in a statement.<br/><br/>The Su-30 fighters, some of China's most advanced jets, were issued verbal warnings to leave and Taiwanese air force jets "took active responses to dispel" the intruders, the ministry said.<br/><br/>"The military has full surveillance and control of all activities in the sea and air that surround Taiwan, and the public can rest assured of our capability to uphold security for our national territory," the ministry said.<br/><br/>The defense ministry also confirmed that a U.S. C-40A transport plane had just hours before passed over Taiwan with permission near Taipei before heading south along the country's coast.<br/><br/>The incidents occurred a day after the commander of the U.S. 7th Fleet confirmed that the guided-missile destroyer USS Russell had passed through the Taiwan Strait the previous week, according to a report in the Stars and Stripes. This was the U.S. Navy's seventh such transit this year and second in two weeks.<br/><br/>The Chinese incursion also came hours after Taiwan's defense ministry announced the country's annual Han Kuang exercises, which had been postponed due to the coronavirus, will be conducted in July and September, Taiwan's Central News Agency reports.<br/><br/>The annual exercises test the country's capabilities to ward off attack from China's People's Liberation Army.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SIPING, JILIN, CHINA <br/> A woman has been caught on CCTV spitting a big green onto the buttons in an elevator.<br/><br/>The incident was posted on Weibo and took place on the 13th of June in a residential building in the city of Siping. <br/><br/>In the clip, we see the woman step into the elevator, take off her hat and mask, and then, in a counter-epidemic-prevention move, spit over the buttons. As she goes to leave the elevator, she puts her mask back on.<br/><br/>The thick spit was noticed by residents of the building and was quickly brought to the attention of security staff who watched the security tape to find out who the rank culprit was.<br/><br/>The worst part about this is that it turned out the woman didn't even live in the building, she was just a visitor. <br/><br/>The woman was detained by police for just a mere seven days, however, netizens made their voice heard and are calling for her to receive a harsher punishment.<br/><br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>WARNING: Chinese 'Street Patrol' Beat Dog to Death</title>
      <description><![CDATA[YONGZHOU, HUNAN, CHINA <br/> A video posted to Chinese social media on June 17, shows yet again, a dog being beaten to death on the street by Chengguan officers. <br/><br/>These Chengguan, are essentially street security in place of police tasked with enforcing various routine regulations and they're known for their heavy-handed approach to usually minor misdemeanors.<br/><br/>In this video, that we cannot show, the dog, according to the report was the pet of a woman who lives in a residential community in the Hunan city of Yongzhou, the woman had the papers to back up her ownership claim, however, unfortunately for this pup, these so-called 'urban management officers' caught the dog running about without a leash so, they whacked it to death with metal poles and chucked its body in the back of a truck.<br/><br/>According to the report, there is a sign in the neighborhood that actually warns if a dog is not tied up it will be killed, at the very least, however, you'd expect them to do it humanely, not execute the animal in the street by being bludgeoned to death. <br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>4-year-old Boy Falls From 29th Floor and Survives</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHANGZHOU, JIANGSU, CHINA <br/> After being irresponsibly left home alone, a four-year-old boy is extremely lucky to be alive after falling from the 29th floor of a residential high-rise in China.  <br/><br/>Yang Yang from Changzhou city Jiangsu province was left in the care of his grandmother on the 8th of June by his migrant worker parents. <br/><br/>According to the report posted to Miaopai on the 19th, Yang Yang's grandmother, at some point during the day, decided to irresponsibly 'run errands' for 15 minutes leaving the boy home alone inside the 29th-floor apartment watching television.<br/><br/>Whilst grandmother diddled about, Yang Yang climbed onto the kitchen cabinet and fell out of a carelessly left open window. <br/><br/>He plummeted some 90 meters down. <br/><br/>Incredibly, the boy's fall was broken as he hit trees below before landing in a flower bed.<br/><br/>Finally, after running those crucial errands, his grandmother returned, finding her grandson lying in the dirt; he was gravely injured but miraculously alive.<br/>Yang Yang was in critical condition for more than a week, suffering from respiratory failure, broken ribs, and a concussion, however, fortunately, he is now awake and it seems out of life-threatening danger. <br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>Chinese Man Loses an Eel Inside His Bum</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DONGGUAN, GUANGDONG, CHINA <br/> A Chinese man from Dongguan, Guangdong province was suffering from long time constipation and decided that he'd try his hand at something different, so he forced a live eel into his bum to try and relieve his suffering.<br/><br/>According to the report via Miaopai on the 21st of June, the man who is in his fifties had heard somewhere that putting an eel into your anus could help with bowel movements; so what did he do? Research first? Get a second opinion? <br/><br/>No. He went to the market, bought an eel, and started stuffing. <br/><br/>Expectedly, the 'medicine' had some severe consequences, the 40cm long eel was stuck and causing havoc.<br/><br/>Incredibly, this guy hung about for five days with a live eel inside his body before he decided it was time to go to the hospital, however, by that point the eel had done some serious damage. His colon was ruptured and he had severe contamination to his digestive tract and septic shock. <br/><br/>Thankfully, fast-acting doctors performed surgery and extracted the eel. The doctors said that if the man had waited any longer he would have died. <br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <description><![CDATA[WUHAN, CHINA <br/> 'Facekinis' have made a comeback as visitors to a recently re-opened waterpark in Wuhan donned facial tightknits to protect themselves not only from those hateful UV rays but apparently, also from the deadly virus. <br/><br/>What's a 'facekini'? Well, typically sported by women of a certain age in China, the 'facekini' is a very unique face-covering swimwear that protects against harmful rays whilst offering glamour and flare, however, the post-COVID world has relaunched the face-knit as a must for all swimmers in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.<br/><br/>According to the report, the water park has restricted its capacity to just 30%, visitors also need to have their temperatures checked and their health QR code scanned to enter; the facekini, however, is not required. <br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.
