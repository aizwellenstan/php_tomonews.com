      <title>Hong Kong: China Passes Draconian National Security Law</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI <br/> Beijing has passed a new national security law on Tuesday. The controversial law grants the government sweeping powers that critics fear will be used to quash Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy. <br/><br/>The legislation passed the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress by a unanimous vote. The law sets down new crimes for subversion, splittism, and colluding with foreign governments and outside forces. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.<br/><br/>Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam will receive authority to appoint judges to hear national security cases, while Beijing gains the power to interpret laws as it sees fit. These developments have cast into doubt whether judicial independence will survive in the territory.<br/><br/>Hong Kong Free Press reports that within minutes of the law's passage, Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong withdrew from Demosisto, the democracy group he had led.

      <title>Apocalyptic Sandstorm Engulfs Chinese City in Minutes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOTAN, XINJIANG, CHINA <br/> On June 28th, residents stood witness to a monstrous sandstorm. <br/><br/>Footage posted to Weibo shows cars being brought to a halt as the instantaneous wind force reached level 9, carrying with it monstrous plumes of dust that blocked out the sun, making the roads too hazardous to drive. <br/><br/>In other clips, we can see a heavy haze looming over buildings and a giant wall of sand moving towards it.<br/><br/>Local residents said that this was the harshest sandstorm they have seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>According to a report by BTV, Hotan Airport canceled a total of 5 flights, and delayed 9, affecting nearly 1,000 passengers. As an ancient oasis town, the area has always dealt with sandstorms because of its close proximity to the Taklimakan Desert, however, in recent years deforestation has made the area more sustainable to these extreme weather events. <br/><br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.
