      <title>Man Aims Bow and Arrow at 'Black Lives Matter' Protestors</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SALT LAKE CITY <br/> A video of a white man aiming a bow and arrow at demonstrators has gone viral, as Black Lives Matter protests spread across the world demanding justice over the killing of George Floyd.<br/><br/>The footage which has been viewed millions of times on Twitter shows a man, now identified as Brandon McCormick, getting out of his car yelling 'all lives matter' before producing a hunting bow in the middle of the protests in Salt Lake City, Utah.<br/><br/>In the video, a woman is heard shouting 'look at this, call yourself an American?' as he readies the weapon and replies, 'Yes I'm an American, all lives matter!' <br/><br/>McCormick then turns away from the camera and takes aim at protesters before the woman screams, 'Don't you dare!'<br/><br/>In a different clip showing another angle, the protestors can then be seen taking cover behind cars to get out of his line of sight. <br/><br/>Suddenly a group rushes McCormick, tackling him to the ground where they pummel and disarm him. According to social media users, his car was then flipped over, and according to McCormick during an interview, was then set on fire. <br/><br/>A beaten McCormick, with a cut above his eye, told the reporter what happened, claiming protesters attacked him after he shouted from inside his car, saying, 'first I got beat up when I yelled, 'All Lives Matter,' then I pulled out weapons, then I got beat up some more.'<br/><br/>McCormick claimed that two black men 'beat me through my open window' before he got out with the hunting bow.<br/><br/>When the reporter urged him to see a doctor for his cut, McCormick said, 'I can't afford to, I'm on unemployment.'<br/><br/>According to KSL.com, McCormick also had a large knife in his possession and was taken into police custody.<br/><br/><br/>TomoNews is your best source for real news.

      <title>How Rubber Bullets Can Injure You, Explainer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON <br/> Rubber bullets fall under the category of kinetic impact projectiles that are used for crowd control purposes by law-enforcement. This is how badly they can injure you. <br/><br/>According to a 2016 report by Physicians for Human Rights and the International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations, rubber bullets can be spherical or cylindrical and can be made of hard rubber, plastic or PVC. They can also be fired as single shots or in groups of multiple projectiles within a cartridge.<br/><br/>Not all crowd control projectiles are made of rubber though.  San Antonio journalist, Mark Dunphy, shared a photo of his injuries on Twitter after being shot by a wooden projectile. According to a report published in BMJ Open in 2017, rubber bullets can cause serious injuries and even death.<br/><br/>The study found that out of 1,984 individuals who sustained injuries from kinetic impact projectiles, 53 died and 300 were permanently disabled from the injury. 71 percent of the survivors had severe injuries.<br/><br/>If an individual receives a shot from a rubber bullet in the neck it could lead to permanent damage or a deadly injury to their airways. A shot sustained in the eye could lead to losing it and a point-blank shot could lead to death.<br/><br/>According to the report by Physicians for Human Rights and the International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations, rubber bullet impacts affect bones, muscles, and limbs most severely.]]></description>

      <title>Revealed: Pentagon Held War Game to Quash Gen Z Rebellion</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON <br/> The Pentagon conducted a war game in 2018 that pitted armed forces against a youth uprising dubbed "Zbellion," according to documents obtained by the Intercept via the Freedom of Information Act.<br/><br/>The troubling revelation came days after Secretary of Defense Mark Esper urged states to "dominate the battlespace" in dealing with Black Lives Matter protests.<br/><br/>Esper later withdrew the comment and signed orders to remove paratroopers from Washington, DC.<br/><br/>The war game envisioned members of Generation Z <br/> radicalized by the Great Recession and student debt <br/> would start a nationwide uprising in 2025.<br/><br/>The rebels would see themselves as "agents for social change" with the goal of helping to "move the world forward."<br/><br/>According to the scenario, an insurgent group called Zbellion would start a protest movement in Seattle. From there, civil unrest would spread to New York City; Washington, DC; Los Angeles; Los Vegas; and Austin.<br/><br/>The military expected tech-savvy insurgents to launch cyber attacks against financial institutions to redistribute wealth, to fund their colleagues, and to "spread a call for anarchy."]]></description>
