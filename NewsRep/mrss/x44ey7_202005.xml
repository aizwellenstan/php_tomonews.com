      <title>The world's largest iceberg is drifting away from Antarctica</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SOUTH ORKNEY ISLANDS <br/> It looks like the beginning of the end for the world's largest iceberg, the BBC reports. <br/><br/>New satellite images show Iceberg A-68 lost a 175 square km chunk of ice, which will likely be called Iceberg A-68c, between satellite passes on April 21 and April 22, according to images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission.<br/><br/>Iceberg A-68 broke off from the Larsen Ice Shelf in July of 2017 and remained largely intact for three years as it drifted past the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea. Today it is around 5,000 square km, almost four times the size of Greater London. <br/><br/>Currents in the Southern Ocean are now pushing the iceberg past the South Orkney Islands into increasingly warmer waters.]]></description>

      <title>Microplastics Disrupt Hermit Crabs' Ability to Choose Shells</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND <br/> A study published in the journal Biology Letters has found that exposure to microplastics can disrupt a hermit crab's ability to choose a shell. <br/><br/>Researchers from Queen's University Belfast and Liverpool John Moores University placed 29 female hermit crabs into a tank containing microplastics. A control group of 35 crabs was placed into a tank with no microplastics. <br/><br/>After five days the crabs were moved into lower-quality shells and presented with the option to choose a higher-quality shell. Only nine of the crabs that had been exposed to microplastics moved into the new shells, compared to 21 from the control group.<br/><br/>This suggests exposure to microplastics impairs the crabs' cognition, and that microplastics in general can have important effects on an animal's behavior.<br/><br/>Gareth Arnott, co-author of the new research from Queen's University Belfast, told the Guardian he was surprised by the results. "We hypothesize that either some aspect of the polyethylene is getting into them to affect their decision making, or else it is an indirect effect that the presence of the plastic in the tank might be influencing their feeding behavior, for example," he said.]]></description>

      <title>Coronavirus pandemic could last up to two years: study</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MINNEAPOLIS <br/> A report by the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy published last Thursday predicts that the coronavirus pandemic could last from 18 to 24 months.<br/><br/>Experts who participated in the study believe the pandemic will not stop until around 60 to 70 percent of the population becomes immune to the virus.<br/><br/>The coronavirus's longer incubation period and high R0, or reproduction number, make it a highly contagious virus. According to a study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, COVID-19's R0 is a median of 5.7, meaning an infected individual can spread the virus to five to six people.<br/><br/>The study suggests all authorities should prepare for the worst-case scenario or scenario 2, which according to their study is one where the first wave of the spread is followed by a larger wave in the fall or winter of this year.<br/><br/>The researchers posed two other scenarios. Scenario 1 sees small waves of the virus similar in impact occur for about one to two years. In this scenario, the virus slowly stops spreading sometime in 2021.<br/><br/>The third scenario described in the study suggests the first wave we experienced this spring becomes a "slow burn" <br/> depending on the mitigation strategies imposed in different places.<br/><br/>What about after it is all "done"? The study says that SARS-CoV-2 will potentially continue to hang around us humans, popping in and out seasonally with a "diminished severity over time," just like other viruses do. Let's hope that day comes sooner rather than later.]]></description>

      <title>Invasive Giant Murder Hornets Just Came to the U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BLAINE, WASHINGTON <br/> Last December, the Washington State Department of Agriculture confirmed two reports of Asian giant hornets in Blaine, Washington. Two more unconfirmed sightings were reported in Custer, Washington. These killer hornets are now coming out of winter hibernation.<br/><br/>Asian giant hornets can measure between 1.5 to 2 inches, or 3.8 to 25 centimeters,  in length. They have stingers that deliver venom to their victims and mandibles capable of decapitating bees.<br/><br/>According to the WSU Insider, the Asian giant hornet queen wakes from hibernation in April, finds nourishment and then looks for a place to establish a colony that will later go out to bring back food.<br/><br/>The bee population in the United States is most threatened by these hornets from late summer to early fall. While they hunt for food for their next queens, the hornets will decapitate honey bees and eat the bee's larvae and pupae.<br/><br/>Well, you might be thinking, isn't this just nature? The circle of life, so to speak? Nope, not really. First off, we don't know how these hornets made it to the U.S., but they have never been found in the country before, so this new species is an invader and definitely a threat to beekeepers.<br/><br/>Still not feeling like this pertains to you? A threat to bees means a threat to human food production. We need bees in order for many key crops to be pollinated.<br/><br/>According to the United States Department of Agriculture, more than a third of all American crop production requires insects to help pollinate, and the primary pollinator is, you guessed it, honey bee colonies.<br/><br/>So, what can you do? Well, if you live in the States, keep an eye out for these murderous buggers and call local authorities if you are unlucky enough to spot one.<br/><br/>But in your quest to take down the murder hornet invasion, please be aware of their painful, toxin-ridden sting. Oh, and If you're allergic to bees, then definitely stay away because their sting could easily cause a severe anaphylactic shock and even, well, death.]]></description>

      <title>Explainer: Why is the coronavirus so deadly?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI <br/> COVID-19 is an airborne disease that spreads in tiny droplets that contain the new coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. When people inhale contaminated droplets, the virus enters into the nose and the throat.<br/><br/>COVID-19 infection usually begins in the nose and throat, because the mucous membranes of these sites contain epithelial cells that are rich in ACE2 cell surface receptors. The virus needs to exploit ACE2 to get into human cells.<br/><br/>The coronavirus's outer coating is covered in spike proteins that give the virus its crown-like appearance. The spike protein possesses receptor binding domains, or RBDs, that the virus uses to pry open receptors before penetrating the cellular membrane.<br/>The ACE2 receptor normally regulates blood pressure. But the coronavirus's downward RBD can bind with this receptor and allow the virus to enter, and then hijack, the host cell.<br/><br/>Once the virus enters the human cell, its coating dissolves and frees viral RNA to hijack the host cell's apparatuses. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum produces viral RNA and proteins, while its Golgi body packages them into whole new viruses.<br/><br/>As the virus multiplies, the infected person may develop early symptoms, such as a sore throat and dry cough, while spreading plentiful amounts of the virus to others.<br/><br/>Other symptoms for the first week of infection include fever; a loss of smell and taste; and muscle aches.<br/><br/>The lungs contain air sacs called alveoli that keep us alive by exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen.<br/><br/>If the virus moves down the lungs, it attacks the alveoli, which are lined with vulnerable, ACE2 receptor-rich cells.<br/><br/>To fight off infections, white blood cells release cytokines to summon more immune cells. Pneumonic COVID-19 may trigger cytokine storm syndrome, a phenomenon where the body scrambles too many immune cells.<br/><br/>As the virus attacks the lungs, the cytokine storm floods the lungs with white blood cells that destroy both healthy and infected cells.<br/><br/>This fills the air sacs with liquids, mucous and the detritus of dead cells.<br/><br/>Pneumonic COVID-19 disrupts the exchange of oxygen and damages the lungs extensively, which leads to dangerously low oxygen levels that may become fatal.<br/><br/>When the virus gets into the heart, it strikes blood vessel cells that are rich in ACE2 receptors. Clinical studies suggest the viral onslaught causes blood clots that obstruct the artilleries and trigger heart attacks.<br/><br/>Intestinal cells that are responsible for absorbing nutrition called enterocytes also express the RNA for ACE2 and a related enzyme that the virus also exploits, which makes the intestines vulnerable.<br/><br/>A clinical study from the Chinese city of Wuhan found more than a third of COVID-19 patients suffered neurological complications.<br/><br/>According to the neurological study, as many as 35 percent of patients had neurological complications including impaired cognition, stroke and muscle damage. Blood clots that travelled to the brain could be the cause of the strokes.]]></description>

      <title>Rivers may have existed on Mars for more than 100,000 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UTRECHT, THE NETHERLANDS <br/> Scientists believe water may have run in rivers on ancient Mars 3.7 billion years ago, according to a paper published in Nature Communications.<br/><br/>Researchers speculate that the system these rivers formed existed for more than 100,000 years in Mars's geological history.<br/> <br/>Using data gathered by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists surveyed the Hellas Basin and discovered signs on a 200-meter-tall cliff that suggests the region used to support a river system.<br/><br/>Writing in a news release, the team says the extremely high-resolution image from the orbiter's camera allowed them to read the cliff face and see sedimentary rocks that one would find on riverbanks.<br/><br/>According to the researchers, these ancient rivers probably changed their gullies and left behind sandbanks like certain rivers on Earth, such as the Rhine in Germany and rivers in Northern Italy.]]></description>

      <title>Why the North Magnetic Pole is drifting toward Siberia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEEDS, ENGLAND <br/> Scientists now say they may understand why the North Magnetic Pole is moving, according to a new study.<br/><br/>The North Magnetic Pole has been shifting its position from Canada to Siberia, and since the 2000s, the movement has been picking up speed. <br/><br/>Writing in Nature Geoscience, the scientists say there are jets of molten material in the outer core of the Earth, and alterations to the flow are moving the North Magnetic Pole.<br/><br/>According to the paper, researchers utilized the European Space Agency's Swarm satellites to collect the magnetic data needed for the study.<br/><br/>Citing the authors, BBC reports the molten jet is located much further south than the researchers originally thought in their presentation to the American Geophysical Union two years ago.<br/><br/>The study's lead author is cited as saying that the flow made the Canadian magnetic node weaker in relation to the Siberian node, which causes Russia to win the subterranean tug of war for the Magnetic North Pole.]]></description>

The object, the core stage of China's Long March 5B rocket, laned off the coast of Mauritania.<br/><br/>SpaceFlightNow.com reports the core stage of the Chinese rocket was 30 meters long and 5 meters wide. According to CNN, the rocket carried an uncrewed prototype spacecraft to orbit before making an uncontrolled fall to Earth.<br/><br/>The 18-tonne core stage is one of the biggest objects to fall uncontrollably to Earth. Jonathan McDowell at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics tweeted that the  rocket dashed over Los Angeles and New York City before crashing near West Africa.<br/><br/>McDowell says the core stage had slowed enough that it would have at most destroy a house by the time of impact.<br/><br/>CNN reports the only larger objects to have made uncontrolled falls were Skylab in 1979, Skylab's rocket stage in 1975, Russia's Salyut 7 in 1991, and the space shuttle Columbia in 2003.]]></description>

      <title>Archeologists Unearth Remains of Two Female Mongolian Warriors</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ORKHON, MONGOLIA <br/> Archeologists have found the remains of two women warriors while excavating an elite cemetery at an archaeological site in Orkhon, Mongolia.<br/><br/>Archeologists from California State University, Los Angeles, told Live Science that they found the remains of two women warriors while excavating a cemetery at the Airagiin Gozgor archaeological site in Orkhon, Mongolia.<br/><br/>Specialists examined remains found in 29 burial sites. These include human remains from 16 men, 10 women and three unidentified individuals. Researchers were looking for evidence of the effects of horseback riding, archery and trauma on the body.<br/><br/>Christine Lee from California State University, Los Angeles, lead researcher on the yet-to-be-published study, said the remains of the two warriors showed signs that both practiced horseback riding and archery, just like the remains of the men and male adolescents.<br/><br/>The two women are believed to have been 20 and 50 years old and lived during the Xianbei period, which lasted from 147 to 552 AD. This period was marked by political turmoil. Lee and fellow researcher Yahaira Gonzalez said it is likely they practiced archery and horseback riding because they may have been needed to fight alongside the men.<br/><br/>However, it seems that the two ladies might have not really gone to war. These remains were found in elite graves, and members of the elite may have not fought in battles, Lee said.<br/><br/>That doesn't take away from the fact that, in Lee's own words, 'They were probably pretty badass.']]></description>

      <title>Cold War Nuclear Tests Changed Rainfall Patterns</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SHETLAND ISLANDS, SCOTLAND <br/> According to a study published in Physical Review Letters, the electric charge from radioactivity caused by atomic testing during the Cold War caused a rise in precipitation on the Shetland Islands in Scotland.<br/><br/>During the Cold War, radioactive pollution from American and Soviet Union atomic testing sites in the 1960s spread across the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Specialists from the Reading, Bath and Bristol universities participating in the study used information from bomb tests and records from the United Kingdom's national weather service to determine the long-term effects of bomb radioactivity.<br/><br/>According to data gathered from a research station in Scotland, experts found that on days when radioactivity was increased, clouds were heavier and rain increased by 24 percent.]]></description>

      <title>COVID-19 Tied to Severe Inflammation in Children</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON <br/> Nearly 100 children from the United Kingdom developed severe inflammation possibly in connection to the coronavirus, according to the BBC. <br/><br/>Medical workers sounded the alarm in April after eight children from London fell ill, including a 14-year-old who died.<br/><br/>The BBC reports that most of the eight children did not have respiratory issues, but they did share high fever, red eyes, rash, general pain and swelling, citing doctors at Evelina London Children's Hospital.<br/><br/>Despite the absence of breathing or lung problems, seven of the original eight children were put on ventilators to ease heart and circulatory troubles.<br/><br/>Liz Whittaker at Imperial College London told the BBC doctors believe the mystery inflammatory disease is likely a "post-infectious phenomenon" related to antibody buildup following a COVID-19 infection. <br/><br/>Children make up between 1 and 2 percent of coronavirus infections.<br/><br/>The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health is cited as saying the syndrome "is exceptionally rare" and that parents in the UK need not confine their children as lockdown measures are eased.]]></description>

      <title>Hokkaido Gypsy Moth is Detected for the First Time in the U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE <br/> A recent proclamation issued by the governor of the State of Washington, Jay Inslee, warns about the detection of Hokkaido gypsy moths in areas in Snohomish County, Washington. <br/><br/>This is the first detection of the species in the U.S., the Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a press release. <br/><br/>The Hokkaido gypsy moth is native to Russia, according to the National Invasive Species Information Center from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.<br/><br/>Asian gypsy moths measure three and a half inches (about 9 centimeters) long and female moths can lay from 500 to 1,000 eggs, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.<br/><br/>In a press release, the Washington Department of Agriculture said European gypsy moth caterpillars eat more than 500 types of trees, plants, and shrubs.<br/><br/>However, Karla Salp, a spokeswoman for the department, told UPI that Asian gypsy moths pose a greater threat than European gypsy moths because they can consume more species of plants.<br/><br/>If the species establishes itself in Washington it would become a threat to forest ecosystems and could lead to quarantine restrictions and increased homeowner pesticide use, according to Washington's agriculture department.]]></description>

      <title>Astronomers Find Rare Super-Earth in Earth-like Orbit</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND <br/> Astronomers from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand have discovered a new "super-Earth" orbiting a star located in or near the edge of the Milky Way's "galactic bulge," a dense region of stars in the center of our galaxy, according to a press release published by the university on May 11.<br/><br/>This rare super-Earth is 25,000 light-years away. It is one of only a handful among the 4,000 exoplanets to have been detected that is similar to Earth in both size and orbit.<br/><br/>According to their research, which was published on May 7 in The Astronomical Journal, the world is four times the mass of Earth.<br/><br/>It orbits a dim dwarf star that is only 10 percent the mass of our Sun. This star is so small that the researchers could not determine if it is a low-mass star or a kind of failed star called a brown dwarf.<br/><br/>The newly discovered orbits its star at a distance between those of Venus and Earth around our Sun. But because its star's mass is so small, a year on this world lasts 617 days.<br/><br/>To find the planet, the researchers used a method called gravitational microlensing. <br/><br/>"The combined gravity of the planet and its host star caused the light from a more distant background star to be magnified in a particular way. We used telescopes distributed around the world to measure the light-bending effect," University of Canterbury astronomer Antonio Herrera Martin, said in the news release.<br/><br/>"These experiments detect around 3,000 microlensing events each year, the majority of which are due to lensing by single stars," the paper's co-author Michael Albrow was quoted as saying in the news release. <br/><br/>"Dr Herrera Martin first noticed that there was an unusual shape to the light output from this event, and undertook months of computational analysis that resulted in the conclusion that this event was due to a star with a low-mass planet."]]></description>

      <title>Children sick after parents are allegedly sold fake baby formula</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HUNAN, CHINA <br/> Chinese authorities in Hunan are currently investigating a baby product shop following reports of five children being diagnosed with rickets after consuming fake milk powder sold by the store.<br/><br/>Several parents of children allergic to regular milk formula in Yongxing County, Hunan Province went to a baby product shop looking for an amino acid-based milk alternative for their babies only to be sold a protein mix, the South China Morning Post reports, citing local media.<br/><br/>One of the parents surnamed Zhu said that staff at the shop told her the product called Bei An Min was an alternative to baby formula, despite its packaging labeling it as a protein drink. Zhu's daughter drank the powdered protein drink for more than two years.<br/><br/>According to a report by thepaper.cn, five toddlers were reported to have lost weight, and developed eczema and a swollen head after drinking the protein beverage.<br/><br/>The paper.cn also reported that some children would slap their heads and all of them were diagnosed with rickets, a condition caused by vitamin D, calcium or phosphate deficiency. <br/><br/>In an interview with Xi Gua Video, a woman identified as Ms. Chen says that staff told her it was the best-sold product in their store and that all babies allergic to regular formula drank the protein powder."<br/><br/>When Chen pointed out that the product was labeled as a protein supplement, the clerk told her it was 'an abbreviation for milk.']]></description>

      <title>Scientists found one of the oldest stars in the entire cosmos</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SYDNEY <br/> Astronomers have discovered a red giant 3,500 light-years from Earth that could be one of the oldest stars in the cosmos, according to a paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.<br/><br/>Writing in a news release, researchers say the very first stars created by the Big Bang are believed to be extinct, but the red giant they spotted in the galactic halo is likely a descendent of those much older stars.<br/><br/>The red giant contains the least amount of iron ever detected, or 1.5 million times lower than that found in the Sun. Since metallic elements are created by ancient stars, an anemic star is likely to be much older than metallic stars.<br/><br/>The first stars were believed to be made of pure hydrogen and helium. When these stars die, they explode into supernovas and create metal elements. This explains why the red dwarf, a direct progeny of the first stars, contains so little iron.]]></description>

      <title>Asteroid as Large as the Golden Gate Bridge Approaching Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON <br/> This year's second-largest "potentially hazardous" near-Earth object is incoming at speeds of over 11,000 kilometers per second and will zoom past our planet on May 21.<br/><br/>Asteroid 136796, also known as 1997 BQ, is estimated by NASA to be between 640 meters and 1.4 kilometers wide, or roughly the size of the Golden Gate Bridge.<br/><br/>1997 BQ orbits our Sun every 844 days. According to NASA's Asteroid Watch, on May 21 it will pass Earth at a distance of 6.2 million kilometers, slightly closer than this year's largest potentially hazardous near-Earth object, 1998 OR2, which flew past Earth on April 29 at a distance of 6.3 million kilometers.<br/><br/>NASA classifies a near-Earth object <br/> either a comet or an asteroid <br/> as a potentially hazardous object if its orbit brings it within 7.5 million kilometers of Earth's orbit and it is greater than 140 meters in size.<br/><br/>According to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, as of April 21, some 22,582 near-Earth objects had been discovered. Of these, 9,085 were 140 meters or larger in size, and 902 were estimated to be larger than one kilometer.<br/><br/>By comparison, the Chicxulub asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs is estimated to have been 11 to 81 kilometres in diameter.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists Capture the Formation of Two New Planets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MAUNAKEA, HAWAII <br/> A group of astronomers has successfully captured an image of the birth of two planets orbiting the star PDS 70, according to a report published in The Astronomical Journal.<br/><br/>The team of researchers used an infrared pyramid wavefront sensor for adaptive optics located at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to process images of two protoplanets forming from the circumstellar disk of PDS 70.<br/><br/>Using the infrared sensor, the team implemented a new adaptive optics correction technique to interpret image signals taken from PDS 70 multi-planetary system.<br/><br/>This new infrared sensor measures light distortions caused by the Earth's atmosphere.  Sylvain Cetre, a software engineer at Keck Observatory, told Phys.org that the sensor, "dramatically improved our ability to study exoplanets, especially those around low-mass stars where planet formation is actively occurring."]]></description>

      <title>Did We Find A Parallel Universe?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HONOLULU, HAWAII <br/> A team of scientists discovered unusual signals caused by high-energy neutrinos. Their cause is unknown. <br/><br/>A team of scientists discovered unusual signals caused by high-energy neutrinos using a radio detector called the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna, or ANITA, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal submitted on January 6.<br/><br/>ANITA floats above the Antarctic, suspended above the continent's ice sheets by a helium balloon. ANITA is designed to detect high-energy neutrinos that hit the Antarctic floor and generate radio light.<br/><br/>According to the study, ANITA detected signals that seemed to be caused by extremely high-energy neutrinos behaving in an abnormal way.<br/><br/>Usually high-energy neutrinos come to Earth from space. However, these detections showed the neutrinos were hitting the antenna at abnormal angles which suggests they had traveled through the planet. This may mean that the detections could either be physics beyond the Standard Model or a systematic error.<br/><br/>This abnormal behavior has led media outlets to speculate on whether or not this is evidence of a parallel universe. However, these speculations have not been confirmed. <br/><br/>Peter Gorham from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, a principal ANITA researcher, told ScienceAlert, "We have encountered a small number of anomalies in our data, and once we have exhausted all of the possible explanations within the Standard Model of physics, only then is it time to consider other ideas that push those boundaries <br/> we are really not there yet, certainly not at the point where parallel universes are necessary!"]]></description>

      <title>This Is Why It Feels Harder to Wake Up on Cold Winter Mornings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EVANSTON, ILLINOIS <br/> Research done on fruit flies shows that a special batch of neurons sensitive to outer temperatures "suppresses" other neurons in charge of morning "activeness."<br/><br/>A new study published in the journal Current Biology shows scientists have identified a thermometer-like circuit of neurons that inhibits neurons in a fly's brain that activate alertness, particularly in the mornings.<br/><br/>Neurobiologists from Northwestern University found receptors in the fly's antennas that respond to temperatures below around 25 degrees Celsius, or 77 degrees Fahrenheit."<br/><br/>The main recipients of these neurons are another batch of brain neurons. These neurons are part of a larger circuit of brain cells that are in charge of regulating wakefulness and sleep rhythms.<br/><br/>When the circuit of neurons is activated due to a decrease in external temperatures, certain neurons that are normally activated by morning light are shut down.]]></description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays May Be the Source
of Biological 'Handedness'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA <br/> Interaction between cosmic rays and early life-forms may be responsible for the fundamental property of chirality, or "handedness," in biological molecules, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.<br/><br/>Showers of highly energetic, charged particles from the Sun called cosmic rays are constantly bombarding the Earth. When they hit the Earth's atmosphere, they degrade into cascades of elementary particles.<br/><br/>Many organic molecules such as DNA and RNA can be constructed in "left-handed" and "right-handed" versions that are mirror images of each other. In the paper, the researchers propose that the prebiotic soup on ancient Earth produced both left and right-handed versions of these nucleic acids.<br/><br/>Co-authors Noemie Globus, an astrophysicist at New York University, and Roger Blandford, professor of physics and of particle physics and astrophysics at Stanford University, argue that when charged particles from cosmic ray cascades reached the Earth's surface, they affected right-handed and left-handed molecules differently, giving an evolutionary advantage to one chirality. Over time this led to life dominated by a single biological handedness.]]></description>

      <title>This Galactic Collision May Have Formed Our Solar System</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PARIS <br/> A new study published in the journal Nature Astronomy using data from Gaia, a space observatory from the European Space Agency, shows the effects of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy on the formation of the Milky Way Galaxy.<br/><br/>Due to gravitational forces, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy crashes time and time again through the Milky Way's disc. One of these collisions occurred roughly at the same time as the formation of our Sun, around 4.7 billion years ago. It is possible this impact contributed to the Sun's creation.<br/><br/>The team of researchers examined luminosities, distances and colors of stars within 6,500 light-years around the Sun and then compared the information with already available stellar evolution models to understand the effects of the crashes.<br/><br/>Data from Gaia showed three periods of increased star formation. There were peaks 5.7 billion years ago, 1.9 billion years ago and 1 billion years ago. These periods coincide with times where the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is believed to have crashed through the disc of the Milky Way.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. Navy Ship Shoots Down Drone With Laser Weapon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII <br/> The U.S. Navy shot down an aerial drone with a solid state laser weapon during a test off Pearl Harbor on May 16, according to the Pacific Fleet.<br/><br/>The exercise marked the first shot fired by the Laser Weapon System Demonstrator at sea.<br/><br/>The amphibious dock Portland was selected as a test platform for the experimental weapon.<br/><br/>Naval documents published by The Drive suggest the laser should include power and cooling units, other subsystems, and integration with the Aegis Combat System. <br/><br/>According to the U.S. Navy Institute, the LWSD represents advancements in laser director and spectral beam combining technology, which combines multiple beams of different wavelengths into a more powerful laser.<br/><br/>Additionally, the Navy is developing other lasers that will be suitable for the fleet's destroyers that lack the energy output for solid state-type weapons.<br/><br/>These lasers would include hard-kill systems as well as less-than-lethal dazzlers that would dissuade approaching boats and disable surveillance platforms.]]></description>

      <title>Asteroid That Killed the Dinosaurs Hit at 'Deadliest Possible' Angle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[London <br/> Scientists have determined the angle of impact for the asteroid that contributed to the dinosaurs' extinction 66 million years ago, according to a study in Nature Communications.<br/><br/>Writing on behalf of the researchers, Imperial College London says in a news release that the asteroid had struck "at the deadliest possible" angle for life on Earth.<br/><br/>Using geological data from the Chicxulub crater in Mexico in a computer model, scientists calculated the space rock's angle of attack at 60 degrees.<br/><br/>The asteroid with its steep impact angle reached sulfur, carbonates and water deep in the Earth.<br/><br/>The vapors and debris were flung into the atmosphere and triggered a nuclear winter that wiped out the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The researchers found asymmetries between the centers of the mountains inside the crater, the crater's physical center point, and the center of uplifted mantle 30 km beneath the surface. <br/><br/>Scientists then worked backward to model the asteroid's impact.]]></description>

      <title>Ozone Depletion May Have Caused Prehistoric Extinction Event</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND <br/> Ozone depletion may have triggered a mass die-off of ancient fish and plants by ultraviolet ray exposure 358 million years ago, according to a new study in Science Advances.<br/><br/>Science Magazine reports the research team took a "perfect" six-meter-long mudstone drilled core. Preserved in the sample were spores from land plants that had flourished in the Devonian period, when Greenland was part of the Old Redstone Continent.<br/><br/>According to the study, the fossilized spores showed a transition from healthy, normal spores to malformed and blackened spores. The deformities observed strongly suggest the parent plants suffered DNA damage from high levels of ultraviolet-B rays.<br/><br/>The spores dated to the Late Devonian die-off, the second mass extinction in the period that saw the disappearance of many species, including giant armored sharks. The descendants of the surviving bony fish and sharks would populate today's oceans. <br/><br/>Importantly, the second-wave extinction wiped out the first four-limbed fish that had ventured onto land. This means another group of five-toed tetrapods became the precursor of land animals.]]></description>

      <title>Deep Oceans Will Get Warmer,
Even in the Best Case Scenario</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA <br/> Earth's oceans could be experiencing rates of climate change seven times higher than levels today by the second half of the century, even if greenhouse gas emissions drop significantly, according to a report published in Nature Climate Change.<br/><br/>A team of international scientists analyzed present and future models of climate velocity. This is the speed at which marine animals would have to move in order to live in waters with certain temperatures as different ocean layers become warmer.<br/><br/>Scientists then used climate models to estimate climate velocity rates today in three different scenarios: One scenario is where greenhouse gas emissions start falling from now; another is in which emissions would begin to fall in the middle of this century; and the final scenario is one where emissions would continue to rise up to 2100.<br/><br/>However, even in the scenario where emissions would start declining now, climate velocity in the ocean's layer that covers from 200 meters deep up to 1 kilometer down <br/> what is known as the mesopelagic layer <br/> would change from about 6 kilometers per decade to 50 kilometers by mid-century. Conversely, in the same period, climate velocity rate would halve on the ocean's surface level.<br/><br/>Anthony Richardson of the University of Queensland and one of the study's authors told The Guardian, 'This means that marine life in the deep ocean will face escalating threats from ocean warming until the end of the century, no matter what we do now.']]></description>
