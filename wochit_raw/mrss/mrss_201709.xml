The driver escaped on foot.Citizens of at least 24 different countries are among the victims, including one Belgian and three Germans. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. Police in Spain said the attack was linked to an explosion on Wednesday night at a house in Alcanar, 200 km south of Barcelona, in which one person died and at least seven others were injured, according to the Independent.Police believe the explosion may have been part of a larger terror plot that went wrong.The Barcelona atrocity was followed by a second attack on Thursday night in the town of Cambrils, 120 km south of the city.Terrorist suspects drove an Audi A3 into pedestrians in Cambrils. Five men reportedly wearing explosive belts were later shot dead by police.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Location of Barcelona2. Van drives into pedestrians on Las Ramblas3. Route of van on Las Ramblas4.

      <title>MIT researchers find genetic blockade technique to potentialy treat Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers at MIT have discovered a new potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease which involves the interference of an enzyme that forms blockades in brain cells.Scientists have discovered that levels of HDAC2 enzyme are usually higher in people with Alzheimer's. Medical mice with the disease also have elevated levels of this enzyme.HDAC2 binds to a gene called Sp3, which condenses chromatin and reduces the expression of some genes in the DNA that results in blocking memory formation.Researchers at MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory identified the particular section of HDAC2 that binds to Sp3, and overproduced that fragment. The fragment binds to Sp3, preventing it from binding to entire HDAC2 enzymes, thus allowing the expression of memory-linked genes."This is exciting because for the first time we have found a specific mechanism by which HDAC2 regulates synaptic gene expression," Li-Huei Tsai, director of MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the study's senior author said in a press release.Previous attempts at blocking HDAC2 would often trigger dangerous side effects by interfering with the production of red and white blood cells. MIT's technique is the first known procedure to have shown no interference with other enzymes. Researchers are investigating other ways to adapt the technique in human trials.The study was published in the journal Cell Reports.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Drug-bearing micromotors to fight bacteria in stomach</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers at the University of California San Diego have developed micromotors loaded with antibiotics that can treat stomach infections without the use of proton pump inhibitors, a substance used to suppress gastric acid production.Drugs used to treat bacterial infections and other diseases in the stomach are normally taken with proton pump inhibitors. However, the substance can cause adverse side effects such as diarrhea and fatigue or even depression when taken over longer period of in high doses."It's a one-step treatment with these micromotors, combining acid neutralization with therapeutic action," said Berta Esteban-Fernndez de vila, a postdoctoral scholar at UC San Diego and a co-first author of the study.According to the study, each micromotor has a magnesium core coated with a layer of titanium dioxide, antibiotic and an outer layer of chitosan, which is a polymer that enables the motors to stick to the stomach wall. The size of each micromotor is about half the width of human hair.Once inside the stomach, the magnesium core reacts with gastric acid which generates a stream of hydrogen microbubbles. The microbubbles propel the vehicles inside the stomach, as well as temporarily increase the pH level to a desired level to release the cargo of antibiotics. The micromotors can be dissolved by gastric acid without leaving harmful residues.The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Layers of the micromotor2.

      <title>Bodybuilder's death caused by excessive protein shakes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Contact inquiries@nextanimation.com to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEA bodybuilder's death in western Australia is being blamed on an excessive intake of protein shakes. Meegan Hefford, 25, was discovered unconscious in her Perth apartment on June 19, and was pronounced dead only a few days later, according to Yahoo 7 News.  Hefford had just begun a protein-rich diet and increased her gym workouts in preparation for an upcoming competition, according to her mother Michelle White. Hefford, however, was unaware she suffered from urea cycle disorder, a rare genetic mutation.A urea cycle disorder is caused by a mutation that leads to a deficiency in one of the six enzymes in the urea cycle, according to the National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation (NUCDF). These enzymes remove excess ammonia from the blood stream. The urea cycle removes nitrogen, a waste product created during protein metabolism, from the blood and converts it into a compound called urea. The urea is transferred into the urine and excreted from the body, according to the NUCDF.   In urea cycle disorders, nitrogen builds up in the blood in the form of ammonia, a highly toxic substance. The ammonia then reaches the brain, where it can lead to irreversible brain damage, coma and/or death. In Hefford's case, physicians believe her excessive protein intake may have led to the rapid buildup of ammonia in her blood and accumulation of fluid in her brain, Refinery 29 reported.

The installation aims to supply electricity to hybrid freight trucks. A pantograph needs to be raised from the truck to connect with overhead power lines in order to receive electricity.The connection allows the trucks to trade energy with the power system. The energy would be fed back into the system when the truck brakes and released to the vehicles when they accelerate.The eHighway is said to be twice as efficient compared to internal combustion engines, and can also significantly reduce local air pollution.The installation in Frankfurt is expected to be completed by the end of next year. The project was previously tested on a 2km stretch of public roads near Stockholm, Sweden last year.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Location of the eHighway2. The eHighway provides power for hybrid trucks3.

This could increase the heart's ability to pump more blood."This experimental therapy is very exciting, particularly because it shows promise in treating both left and right heart failure,"Dr. Duncan Stewart, Executive Vice-President of Research at The Ottawa Hospital and co-senior author on the paper said in a press release.There are more than 200,000 heart failure cases in the U.S. every year.

The submarine left the port of Copenhagen on Thursday evening.According to local media DR, Wall's boyfriend reported her missing on early Friday morning when they didn't return, which prompted a search-and-rescue operation.On Friday morning, private motorboats discovered the submarine near the Drogden Lighthouse in Kge [a]Bay. Rescuers said he jumped into the water and swam for safety as the submarine sank, DR reported.After he was brought to shore, Madsen told police that the submarine sank due to problems with a ballast tank. He also claimed that he dropped off Wall at the port of Copenhagen on Thursday night.Copenhagen police conducted an examination of the submarine from Saturday to Sunday and determined that it was sunk deliberately, contrary to Madsen's claim of a technical fault. However, no body was found in the boat.The crowdfunded UC3 Nautilus is reportedly the largest privately-built submarine in the world.

The research looked at the effect of gameplay on the hippocampus and the caudate [b]nucleus.  It was published this month in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.The first is responsible for emotions, learning and memory formation, the latter helps us form habits and routines. Routines such as when to eat, exercise or get home from work and how to reward yourself for your behavior are stored in the caudate nucleus.Participants in the videogame study played games for between 2 and 4 hours, 3 times a week, for up to 12 hours per week, resulting in 90 hours of gameplay time. The study found the hippocampus shrank after 90 hours of action and shooter gaming because players used their caudate nucleus more to play and navigate.However, the reverse was true for those playing 3-D platform games. After 90 hours, researchers saw an increase in the gray matter in their hippocampi.But University of Oxford Professor Andrew Przybylski[c], points out the study lacks statistical power and the framing of harm may mislead readers.

The chassis of Lina is made from a honeycomb core made of polylactic acid sandwiched between two flax fiber composite sheets. The structure is said to be comparable in strength to fiberglass. "Only the wheels and suspension systems are not yet of bio-based materials," Yanic van Riel, a member of the team told Reuters.The biocomposite materials give the car an incredible light weight of only 300 kg, thus significantly reduces battery size in comparison to other electric cars.Users can access the car via a smartphone or a card with NFC chip.

      <title>NASA's voyager spacecraft still sending data back to Earth after 40 years in operation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Contact inquiries@nextanimation.com to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONENASA's Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft are coming up on their 40-year anniversaries of exploration this August and September. The two spacecraft are still sending data back to Earth despite their vast distance, setting space exploration milestones.Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were launched in 1977 to take advantage of an alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune that made it possible to use gravitational assists to explore the planets in a much shorter time. This alignment, discovered by Gary Flandro, who was a doctoral student at Caltech in 1965, appears once every 175 years.Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977. It was the only spacecraft that conducted flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977. It took a shorter but faster trajectory that used a gravity assist at Saturn to take it out of the solar system. Each spacecraft carries a gold-plated record of Earth sounds, pictures and messages for any intelligent extraterrestrial life that might find them."None of us knew, when we launched 40 years ago, that anything would still be working, and continuing on this pioneering journey," Ed Stone, Voyager project scientist based at Caltech in Pasadena, California said in a press release. "The most exciting thing they find in the next five years is likely to be something that we didn't know was out there to be discovered."In 2012, Voyager 1 became the first spacecraft to cross into interstellar space. It is still transmitting data at a staggering distance of almost 13 billion miles away from Earth.Voyager 2 is in the space known as heliosheath, almost 11 million miles from Earth. It is expected to enter interstellar space in the next few years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune that appear once 175 years2.

      <title>How can the U.S. declare war?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Contact inquiries@nextanimation.com to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEU.S. president Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is "far stronger and more power than ever before" after warning North Korea that their provocations would be met with "fire and fury" the previous day.The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to declare wars and authorize funds to support them. The president would normally appeal to Congress for authorization if he wants to declare wars.However, the president also has temporary authority for 60 days to use force without congressional approval. Even though the decision cannot be opposed, Congress can choose to cut funding if it believes the military engagement is not in the best interest of the country.Under international law, the U.S. may only use military force against another sovereign state if it faces an imminent, unprovoked and certain threat. The U.S. may use force in anticipation of that imminent attack but it cannot declare war based on potential threats.Or, the U.S. could declare wars after receiving an authorization from the UN Security Council, which it serves as a permanent member. However, other permanent members such as China and Russia could veto the appeal."Any decision that the president were to take now, or that he took in January, would take years to implement," Jon Wolfsthal, who served in the Obama administration as the National Security Council's senior director for nonproliferation and arms control told the Washington Post. "I'm very skeptical of the idea that Trump believes that he has modernized or adjusted our arsenal, because there have been no visible changes to it."On the other hand, countries in Asia are having mixed feelings towards President Trump's recent language."Trump doesn't seem to understand what an alliance is, and doesn't seem to consider his ally when he says those things," Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul told the New York Times. "No American president has mentioned a military option so easily, so offhandedly as he has. He unnerves people in South Korea, few of whom want war in Korea."The U.S. and North Korea came very close to war in 1994 after Pyongyang announced its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The crisis was reportedly resolved after a top-level diplomatic meeting of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and former DPRK leader Kim II Sung.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Congress has power to authorize war2.

The country conducted two ICBM tests last month, which shows its potential to hit most of the continental U.S.In a response, the United Nations imposed its toughest sanctions yet on North Korea, banning the country from exports and limiting investments, which could potentially reduce a third of the country's $3 billion worth of export revenue.However, North Korea said the sanctions would not stop it from developing nuclear weapons and threatened to make the U.S. to pay the price.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

A droplet containing genetic material is placed on top of the chip, and then zapped with an electrical current.The DNA is delivered through channels created by the current, and it reprograms skin cells to turn into specific cell types that can then be used in other parts of the body.When tested on a mouse with a damaged leg, researchers found vascular cells converted from skin cells formed new blood vessels that allowed the leg to heal in two weeks.The non-invasive technology was also able to generate nerve cells in the legs of brain-damaged mice.

Food or bacteria that comes into contact with nerve endings through the tubules in dentin tissue is what causes pain.A group of researchers led by Cui Huang of Wuhan University combined a green tea polyphenol called epigallocatechin-3-gallate, or EGCG, with a mineral called nanohydroxyapatite to combat teeth sensitivity. EGCG is a micronutrient that is known for its ability to fight Streptococcus mutans bacteria, which form biofilms that cause cavities.The mixture successfully plugged the exposed dentin tubules and prevented the formation of biofilms, New Atlas reported.According to New Atlas, the technology can be used to treat both tooth sensitivity and cavities, possibility in the form of a toothpaste additive.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

But the effects of low-oxygen or hypoxic zones on certain species can be permanent, with studies showing it affects fish reproduction and stunts shrimp growth.Setting a federal limit on the use of crop nutrients may be one possible solution, but could prove challenging since it will need to be implemented on more than 25 states, reports NBC.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It landed in the Sea of Japan just five to 10 minutes after the Air France flight passed through the same area.In response to the incident, Air France put out a statement claiming North Korean test zones don't interfere with their flight paths, adding that they analyze potentially dangerous flyover zones. But experts say global aviation systems may not be able to warn airliners if a missile was in its flight path, much less detect it, according to CBS.Adjusting commercial flight paths might be one way of addressing the North Korean safety risk, but it will be both expensive and difficult.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Solving world hunger: Food made from electricity and thin air might be the solution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAPPEENRANTA, FINLAND  Researchers in Finland have made food from electricity and carbon dioxide captured from the air. The study is part of the joint Neo-Carbon Energy research project by scientists at Lappeenranta University of Technology and the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.The food-creating system uses a bioreactor, which contains water, microbes and nutrients such as nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus.The electric current triggers electrolysis of the water and with carbon dioxide captured from the air, the end result of the chemical reaction produces a powdery edible compound.The compound contains more than 50 percent protein, 25 percent carbohydrates and the rest is fats and nucleic acids.“In practice, all the raw materials are available from the air,” Juha-Pekka Pitkänen, Principal Scientist at VTT said in a press release. “In the future, the technology can be transported to, for instance, deserts and other areas facing famine. One possible alternative is a home reactor, a type of domestic appliance that the consumer can use to produce the needed protein.” According to the UN, 795 million people are undernourished globally and another 2 billion people are expected to join them by 2050.]]></description>

Its regional rivals China Eastern Airlines control Shanghai, while China Southern Airlines hold Guangzhou. The new airport will allow China Eastern and China Southern a 40 percent share of passengers each, which may encourage the two provincial airlines to open lucrative new North American routes, Bloomberg reported."There are demands to add hundreds of flights in Beijing every day that get refused because we're running out of resources," Liu Xuesong, general manager of Capital Airports Holding, the operator of Beijing's existing airport, told Bloomberg.The new airport is due to open in 2019 and will have a capacity of 100 million passengers a year. Liu told Bloomberg that the current Capital International Airport and the new airport together will handle 170 million passengers annually with their seven runways by 2025.Industry experts worry the expansion will result in heavy air traffic as only about 20 percent of China's airspace is open to civilian flights.China is known for flight delays.

      <title>Poor air quality on planes could make frequent flyers sick</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEA new study reveals that the poor air quality on commercial planes could make frequent flyers sick.The study, published in the journal Public Health Panorama, confirmed that over 200 aircraft crew experienced aerotoxic syndrome after being exposed to contaminated cabin air supplied by the controversial bleed-air system.Bleed-air systems have been widely used in commercial aircraft since the 1950s. When air is sucked into the engine compressor, a small portion of the compressed air is redirected through valves into the cabin air-conditioning units, where it is cooled and mixed with recirculated cabin air.Air contamination can happen when the oil on the combustion parts of the engine heat up, and the chemicals leak through damaged seals into the compressor, before entering the valves that send compressed air to the air-conditioning units. The filters in the units are designed to remove bacteria, viruses and dust, but cannot remove toxic chemicals.Obvious leaks, which can be identified by smoke or smells, are known as fume events that can cause acute toxicity. However, constant exposure to low-level contaminated air may also lead to aerotoxic syndrome, of which symptoms include runny nose, vomiting, severe headaches and even memory loss.Boeing's 787 Dreamliner is the only aircraft that does not include the bleed-air system. The company claims the new electric system would help passengers arrive at their destinations "fresher", the Guardian reported.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Illustration of bleed-air system2.

This can disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to an increased risk of breast cancer.The study tracked data from nearly 110,000 women in the U.S. between 1989 and 2013. The results shows the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women who smoke or who used to smoke increases with greater exposure to outdoor nighttime light. However, older women and those who had never smoked did not seem to be affected by the lighting."In our modern industrialized society, artificial lighting is nearly ubiquitous. Our results suggest that this widespread exposure to outdoor lights during nighttime hours could represent a novel risk factor for breast cancer," Peter James, lead author of the study and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School's department of population medicine said in a press release.The study also finds the link was stronger among women who worked night shifts but the authors admit further work is needed to clarify the potential mechanisms.The study was published on August 17 in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The intelligent optics of the blocks focus the incoming sunlight onto the solar cells when placed vertically.The blocks can be linked and wired to one another, generating power for buildings and electric vehicles, or to be stored in batteries.The team says the blocks can be embedded in conventional construction designs. Tinting can also be added to prevent too much sunlight from entering the building's interior. Researchers claim the blocks offer better thermal insulation than traditional glass building materials."Deployment of standard solar technology is limited by the large area requirement and the negative visual impact. We wanted to overcome these limitations by introducing technologies that become a part of the building's envelope,"Dr Hasan Baig, one of the developers of the technology said in a press release.Startup company Build Solar, which developed the project, is looking for test sites for this technology.

It consists of a transparent polymer, tiny glass beads and a silver layer. The silver layer reflects sunlight through the plastic, preventing it from heating the building while the glass beads constantly emit infrared light and heat through a process called passive radiation cooling.The cooling effect is said to be able to keep the internal temperature of a home at 20 degrees Celsius when the outside temperature is 37 degrees, the Economist reported."We feel that this low-cost manufacturing process will be transformative for real-world applications of this radiative cooling technology," Xiaobo Yin, co-director of the research and an assistant professor at the university, said in a press release.

According to CBS News, the diplomats suffer from symptoms ranging from hearing loss and nausea to headaches and balance disorders.It is believed a sophisticated sonic weapon that operated outside the range of human audible sound was deployed either inside or outside the residences of U.S. diplomats in Havana, three U.S. officials told CNN. The residences were provided by the Cuban government.It is possible that the device generated infrasound, which is below the range of human hearing. It travels great distances and can easily penetrate most buildings. Low frequency infrasound can affect the vestibular system, while high powered infrasound can cause result in nausea and pressure in the chest.Meanwhile, high frequency ultrasound can damage the blood vessels in the ear canal.

As a result, more blood is directed to the brain and the muscles involved in the physical activity."We know that exercise can protect against heart disease, stroke and many other conditions. This study has identified a physiological system that senses when the mammalian body is exercising," Professor David Beech, from the Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine and lead investigator of the study told Eurekalert.Based on experiments on mice, the team discovered an experimental molecule named Yoda1 can increase the blood flow in the endothelium similar to the effect of exercise and thus can activate Piezo1 protein without undergoing exercise.

For added security, the system generates different keypad configuration for the intended user for every login attempt."PIN authentication is popular for good reasons, namely that it is easy to use and to remember," Nasir Memon, NYU Tandon professor of computer science and engineering said in a press release. "Our goal was to increase the resilience of PIN authentication without straining the device or compromising user experience."Previous studies show about 73 percent of mobile devices users surveyed reported that they had observed someone else's PIN, but not necessarily with malicious intent.

The move comes amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea over Pyongyang's nuclear program. Russia said the nuclear-capable Tupolev-95MS bombers were flown over the Pacific Ocean, the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, Reuters reported. This prompted Japan and South Korea to send fighters to escort the Russian aircraft.  The two Tupolev-95 bombers were also accompanied by two Russian Sukhoi-35S fighters and an A-50 early warning and control aircraft, according to Newsweek. The Russian Defense Ministry did not say when the mission took place, but announced the mission on the same day Moscow criticized the U.S.-South Korean military drills. "The US and South Korea holding yet more large-scale military and naval exercises does not help reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula," said foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, Reuters reported. "We urge all side to exercise maximum caution. Given the arms build-up in the region, any rash move or even an unintended incident could spark a military conflict."

Researchers have found a correlation between greater deposits of lithium in limestone rocks and warmer periods in the planet's history, when the earth's "weathering thermostat" process sped up.Carbon dioxide traps heat in the earth's atmosphere. A dip in carbon dioxide levels can potentially cause an ice age, while a spike can make the planet heat up.The earth regulates carbon dioxide through the weathering thermostat, Popular Science reported, citing the study.Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere when it dissolves in rainwater and combines with rocks to form bicarbonate. When rocks dissolve in water, the bicarbonate combines with calcium to form limestone, locking carbon dioxide inside.Movement of tectonic plates then draws the limestone under the earth's crust. The carbon dioxide eventually returns to the atmosphere when it separates from the limestone and is thrust out in volcanic eruptions.The earth's thermostat responds to changes in the planet's temperature, according to researchers, Heat speeds up the weathering process, while cold slows it down.Other influences on the climate include solar activity, the growth of vegetation, and the impact of human activity.Scientists believe the earth's natural thermostat cannot keep up with man-made climate change, and are now looking into ways to artificially speed up weathering to counter global warming.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.  Effect of carbon dioxide on climate 2. Carbon dioxide dissolves in rainwater, combines with rocks to form bicarbonate3.

Among the products in which scientists discovered this link are yoga mats.Organophosphate flame retardants, otherwise known as PFRs, can be found in products that use polyurethane foam, such as car seats, sofas and yoga mats. PFRs can be absorbed by the body through physical contact, and it can also migrate out of objects into the air.Researchers analyzed urine samples from 211 women undergoing in vitro fertilization at the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center between 2005 and 2015. It was discovered that more than 80% of the participants were found with PFRs.Women with higher concentrations of the chemicals are said to be 40% less likely to become pregnant or have a live birth compared to those with lower concentrations of the chemicals."Couples undergoing IVF and trying to improve their chances of success by reducing their exposure to environmental chemicals may want to opt for products that are flame-retardant free," Russ Hauser, Frederick Lee Hisaw professor of reproductive physiology and acting chair, Department of Environmental Health and senior author of the study said in a press release.Flame retardant PentaBDE was phased out more than a decade ago after it was found to cause negative health effects and PFRs were introduced as a safer alternative. However, latest studies have shown that the "supposedly safer" flame retardant could still cause hormone disruption.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. PFRs found in car seats, sofas and yoga mats2.

President Michel Timer removed the protective status of the National Reserve of Copper and Associates (RENCA), which straddles the Brazilian states of Amapa and Para, CNBC reported. The area covers 46,000 sq kms (17,800 sq miles) and is believed to be rich in gold, copper, iron and other minerals. Brazil has opened up 30 percent of the reserve, and said that mining would only be permitted in areas with no conservation controls or indigenous lands. The government plans to open up 10 percent of all protected rainforest areas to mining in an attempt to encourage growth, CNN reported. A report published last week by the World Wild Fund for Nature (WWF) stated that mining in the area would cause "demographic explosion, deforestation, the destruction of water resources, the loss of biodiversity and the creation of land conflict," according to CNN. The Rainforest Foundation estimates approximately 1 acre is destroyed every second in the Amazon, and an estimated 20 percent of the rainforest has been destroyed over the past four decades.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

By enabling drones to find and localize items and equipment, this research will provide a fundamental technological advancement for solving these problems," Fadel Adib, the Sony Corporation Career Development Assistant Professor of Media Arts and Sciences, whose group at the MIT Media Lab developed the new system said in a press release.The researchers have fitted each drone with a RFID tag. The drone alternates between relaying the reader's signal to a tagged item and its own signal back to the reader, allowing the reader to identify the item's location. It is said to be able to localize the tagged items accurately within 19 cm, while extending the range of the reader tenfold in all directions.The system is dubbed RFly, which will be presented in a paper at the annual conference of the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications.

Scientists suggest climate change may have a role to play in this deadly storm.According to the department of atmospheric science professor at Pennsylvania State University, Michael E. Mann, the first global warming mechanism that may have made the impact of Hurricane Harvey so severe is the rapid rising sea levels in the Houston region, making the area more likely to flood.The second factor is the rising temperatures in the region which translates to more moisture in the atmosphere, bringing more rain to the region.Human-caused warming penetrating the ocean past the surface has resulted in a deep layer of warm water feeding hurricane Harvey when it intensified near the coast.Furthermore, global warming may have contributed to expanded subtropical high pressure systems which trapped hurricane Harvey in the middle, stalling it near the Texas coast."In conclusion, while we cannot say climate change "caused" Hurricane Harvey (that is an ill-posed question), we can say is that it exacerbated several characteristics of the storm in a way that greatly increased the risk of damage and loss of life. Climate change worsened the impact of Hurricane Harvey," Professor Mann explained in a Facebook post.Climate experts said the rain would continue for another two or three days. Southeast Texas could see an additional 15 to 25 inches of rain while some areas could see as much as 50 inches of rain, the New York Times reported.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Be wary of differences between machines that are side by side  for example if one has a flashing indicator and the other does not.Push and pull at any protruding parts to see if they are securely attached and have only one piece.Skimmers can only read the magnetic strip if the card is inserted in a single, straight motion, so experts suggest wiggling the card as it goes in to foil the skimmer.When using credit cards, avoid transactions that necessitate swiping the magstrip. Instead, use EMV chip readers and NFC or tap to pay, which are more secure and harder to hack.If you do realize your card has been skimmed, or notice any suspicious activity on your account, alert your bank.

Fire ants are an invasive species from South America, and have spread across the southern U.S, according to Business Insider. To escape the rising water, fire ants quickly link together to form a raft. They lock their legs and bodies together tightly enough to trap air in the raft.The ants at the bottom are linked so closely together than no water can get through.  The queen and the larvae are kept at the center of the structure.  The raft changes shape as it floats, with ants moving across the top and joining the stationary layer on the bottom, according to a fire ant raft study.

They have to walk out to the parked car and retrieve their pizza from the compartment using a unique code.As part of the trial, the car will still be manually driven by a Ford engineer with researchers from both companies who hope to investigate customers' reactions to this delivery service. All personnel will exit the car before the customer reaches the vehicle. "The majority of our questions are about the last 50 feet of the delivery experience. For instance, how will customers react to coming outside to get their food? We need to make sure the interface is clear and simple. We need to understand if a customer's experience is different if the car is parked in the driveway versus next to the curb. All of our testing research is focused on our goal to someday make deliveries with self-driving vehicles as seamless and customer-friendly as possible," Russell Weiner, president of Domino's USA said in a press release.Domino's has tested its Domino's Robotic Unit in Australia and New Zealand last year.

In someone suffering from type 2 diabetes, the beta cells malfunction and produce insufficient levels of insulin.Researchers at Brigham Young University have discovered that compounds found naturally in cocoa called epicatechin monomers are able to increase the ability of beta cells to secrete insulin.The team said the compound successfully helped mice on a high-fat diet to cope with elevated blood sugar levels as well as decrease the extent of their obesity."What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress," study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU said in a press release. "The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released."The team are looking for ways to extract the compound out of cocoa in order to make a treatment for current diabetes patients and advised people not to stock up on chocolate bars."You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it," said Tessem.

It's also flat and prone to flooding since the water has nowhere to go, reports Business Insider.The city once had wetlands that acted like sponges to absorb excess water. But urban sprawl meant much of the green spaces have been covered with concrete, which is more water-resistant.There are stormwater drains to catch the flow of rainwater, but these are largely outdated, and cannot handle high volumes.Building regulations in Houston are also not as strict, which leads to many flood-prone residential structures being built in flood zones. Some experts believe climate change may have also worsened Hurricane Harvey. And with worsening weather in our future, Houston's situation emphasizes the need for stricter flood control measures especially in coastal cities.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It's also flat and prone to flooding since the water has nowhere to go.""The city once had wetlands that acted like sponges to absorb excess water. But urban sprawl meant much of the green spaces have been covered with concrete, which is more water-resistant.""There are stormwater drains to catch the flow of rainwater, but these are largely outdated, and cannot handle high volumes.""Building regulations in Houston are also not as strict, which leads to many flood-prone residential structures being built in flood zones.

And though the storm has left the city, the catastrophic flooding continues.Scientific American reports that despite being flat and prone to flooding, Houston lacks a high-tech drainage system, and relies on slow-moving creeks or streams called bayous to empty its flood waters.The city's 10 bayous typically flow from west to east, before going through the Houston Ship Channel into Galveston Bay in the Gulf of Mexico.The Addicks and Barker reservoirs were built in the 40s to help contain floodwater, but the Addicks has been pushed past capacity, and the Barker might soon overflow as well.Given the speed and volume of the rainfall, surface soils become saturated quickly, and are soon too full to take in any more water. This is made more difficult by the less-absorbent concrete and asphalt that cover the city.Water cannot evaporate quickly, either, given Houston's humid climate. And with slowly receding floods already soaking through items and property, the damage may be long-lasting.No one currently knows how long it will take for the floods to drain completely, with experts estimating it will take anywhere from a few days to possibly even weeks.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The pair have been studying bears on Kodiak Island for years. Every summer they would see grizzlies eating large amounts of sockeye salmon in preparation for the winter.  Then in 2014, bacteria began eating the salmon and the bears were no longer seen hunting for fish. The same thing happened in 2015. The scientists placed tracking collars on 15 bears at the beginning of 2014 to see where the grizzlies were going to in the summer. They found that the bears were in the hills next to elderberry bushes. Warmer temperatures were causing elderberries to ripen earlier in the season than usual. This meant salmon and elderberries were available at the same time, and that bears were choosing the berries over fish. Elderberries contain less protein compared to salmon and require less energy to digest, leading to faster weight gain for bears. The change is diet was also found to be affecting the bears' natural habitat because fewer fish carcasses in the forests meant less nutrients being absorbed into the soil.      RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
