A pilot was heard saying 'pitch up, pitch up!' before the radio died.According to the Wall Street Journal, investigators determined that the anti-stall system on the 737 Max 8 jet automatically activated before the crash. The same software is being blamed for the Lion Air crash that killed 187 in Indonesia. According to the BBC, the Lion Air investigation suggested that MCAS malfunctioned, forcing the plane's nose down over 20 times before it plunged into the sea.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Chytridiomycosis, or chytrid, is caused by two strains of the Batrachochytrium fungus and originally found on the Korean Peninsula. The BBC reports that the disease has spread to over 60 countries, likely facilitated by humans through the legal and illegal pet trade.According to the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage, chytrid produces spores that can stay in fresh water or moist environments until they find an amphibian host.The fungus attacks keratin in the frog's skin, disrupting its ability to breathe and absorb water. This causes the skin to degrade and get shed off, and eventually triggering cardiac arrest that results in death.According to a paper published in Science, an estimated 501 amphibian species have declined due to chytrid, with 90 confirmed or presumed extinct.The authors say their research highlights the need to take biosecurity risks to wildlife  more seriously in order to prevent new strains from emerging and spreading.They further hope their study can help save surviving frog species, as there is still a high risk of more becoming extinct over the next few decades.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers have developed plants that can produce nanomaterials which then give them extraordinary abilities that could allow them to someday grow on Mars. The study, authored by a team from the University of Melbourne, was presented at an American Chemical Society meeting on April 3.According to the ACS, metal organic frameworks or MOFs consist of metal ions linked to organic molecules, which form highly porous crystals that can store and release chemicals. Potential applications for MOFs range from energy storage to drug delivery.While plants readily absorb water and molecules dissolved in it, MOFs are too big to go into the vascular system.Researchers added metal salts and organic linkers to water, and placed the plants in the solution. Once the MOF precursor molecules are absorbed, they are converted into finished nanomaterials inside the plant's tissue.In experiments, MOF precursor molecules in lotus plant clippings grew into fluorescent crystals that were able to detect concentrations of acetone in the water - fading slightly when it did so.Plant cuttings were also coated with luminescent MOFs and then exposed to UV light for three hours. Those with the coating had less wilting and bleaching.According to the researchers, the MOFs are also able to convert harmful UV into light that's useful for photosynthesis. This is useful for growing crops in space, especially on Mars, where ultraviolet radiation is abundant due to the lack of atmosphere.According to the ACS, the team has not noticed any toxicity in the nanomaterials, and is now working with plant biologists to study how MOFs affect plant growth.

Once the MOF precursor molecules are absorbed, they are converted into finished nanomaterials inside the plant's tissue.""In experiments, MOF precursor molecules in lotus plant clippings grew into fluorescent crystals that were able to detect concentrations of acetone in the water - fading slightly when it did so.""Plant cuttings were also coated with luminescent MOFs and then exposed to UV light for three hours. Those with the coating had less wilting and bleaching.""According to the researchers, the MOFs are also able to convert harmful UV into light that's useful for photosynthesis.""This is useful for growing crops in space, especially on Mars, where ultraviolet radiation is abundant due to the lack of atmosphere."SOURCES: American Chemical Societyhttps://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2019/april/nanomaterials-give-plants-super-abilities-video.html***]]></description>

Here, we recreate what went down based on that video.CBS reports that on March 31, rapper Nipsey Hussle and three other men were standing in front of his clothing store in L.A.'s Hyde Park.According to the LAPD, gang member Eric Holder approached the group several times, engaging them in conversation before leaving.According to CNN, Holder returned around 3:20 p.m. armed with a handgun and opened fire at the group. Surveillance video from an adjacent business shows Hussle and another man fall to the ground, as the others run from the gunfire.In the video, the shooter appears to walk away, before then coming back to shoot Hussle a second time, and then a third. He kicks the rapper after the third shot, then flees the scene. CNN reports that Hussle died from gunshots to the head and torso. Two others were wounded.According to the LAPD, Holder ran down an alley following the shooting, and got into a waiting car driven by a woman, which then sped away.The LA Times reports that the woman turned herself in after news of the shooting broke out, claiming she didn't know what Holder did when she picked him up.

      <title>Mick Jagger to undergo heart valve replacement surgery</title>

Here's what that entails.According to the British Heart Foundation, there are four valves in the heart that make sure blood flows through the heart in the correct direction.When a valve is damaged, it may need to be replaced when it either does not close properly and leaks blood, or has become narrowed and obstructs blood flow. Otherwise, it could get worse and may lead to heart failure.According to the NHS, valve replacement surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic.During the procedure, a 25-centimeter-long incision is made down the middle of the breastbone to access the heart. A heart-lung bypass machine is attached to take over pumping blood to the rest of the body, and the heart is stopped. Once the vessel is clamped and opened up, the damaged valve is removed and replaced with a new one that is either artificial or biological. The heart is then restarted using controlled electric shocks, and the new valve checked before the heart-lung bypass machine is removed and all incisions are closed."Patients who have had a valve replaced typically stay in the hospital for a week, and take two to three months to fully recover.According to the Telegraph, Jagger's doctors have said he is expected to make a complete recovery after his surgery.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to ABS-CBN News, Filipino fishermen near the Scarborough Shoal spotted the U.S. ship on Tuesday. Fishermen said they saw U.S. aircraft landing and taking off from the ship, about 5 km away from the fishermen's boat. According to the Japan Times, a U.S. military spokeswoman would not confirm or deny  the Wasp's presence, but did confirm that the ship "has been training with Philippine Navy ships in Subic Bay and in international waters of the South China Sea … for several days."Scarborough Shoal, which is claimed by the Philippines, Taiwan, and China, was seized by Beijing in 2012 after an extended standoff with Manila. According to the Japan Times, the Wasp's presence in the South China Sea will likely draw attention from Beijing as it is paired with U.S. Marine Corp's F-35B Lightning II stealth fighters. The F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing variant of the fighter jet. Scarborough Shoal is of strategic significance to China in order to solidify its grip over the South China Sea. In an effort to push back against Chinese behavior near Scarborough, the U.S. Navy sent a guided-missile destroyer within 12 nautical miles (22 km) of the site in January of last year as part of its larger "freedom of navigation operations."

Footage shows him driving to the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, and selecting a weapon from the boot of the car.""At around 1:40 p.m., he walked into the mosque through the front entrance and opened fire at people inside, who were there for Friday prayers.""Based on the footage, the BBC reports that Tarrant opened fire inside the women's prayer hall, and then the men's before changing weapons in his car. He then re-entered the mosque and shot at bodies in the men's hall before leaving.""From Al Noor mosque, Tarrant drove five kilometers to another mosque in Linwood.""Linwood's acting imam Latef Alabi told Stuff that he was leading prayers for a congregation of over 80 when he heard a voice outside at around 1:55 p.m.""He looked out the window to find a man holding a large gun and bodies on the ground, and told everyone to get down.""According to the New York Times, Tarrant was firing through a window when Abdul Aziz, a member of the congregation, ran out and threw a credit card machine at him. Aziz followed the attacker and picked up a discarded gun. He later threw the gun at Tarrant's windshield, prompting him to drive away.""Stuff reports that police officers managed to force Tarrant's car from the road soon after.

      <title>First ever black hole photo revealed by scientists</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions or custom animation requests, contact tips@nextanimation.com.tw. Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANScientists using a global network of telescopes released the first ever image of a black hole, an achievement that validates Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. The details were announced in a series of six scientific papers published in Astrophysical Journal Letters. According to Reuters, the photo of the black hole at the center of Messier 87, or M87, a galaxy residing in the center of the Virgo galaxy cluster, shows a glowing ring of red, yellow and white surrounding a dark center. The image was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT,  a network of eight linked radio telescopes in six locations that acts as a planet-sized observational dish. The fact that black holes do not let light escape makes viewing them extremely difficult. Scientists looked for a ring of light - super-heated disrupted matter and radiation circling at tremendous speed at the edge of the event horizon - around a region of darkness representing the actual black hole. This is known as the black hole's shadow or silhouette.   The observations confirms the theory of general relativity proposed in 1915 by Einstein to explain the laws of gravity and their relation to other natural forces.Based on his equations, scientists predicted what a black hole would look like due to the immense gravitational pull, and what the light around it should look like.   According to University of Arizona astronomer Dimitrios Psaltis in a press release, "the Event Horizon Telescope allows us for the very first time to test the predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity around supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies." "The predicted size and shape of the shadow theory match our observations remarkably well, increasing our confidence in this century-old theory," he added. According to Reuters, the M87 black hole resides about 54 million light-years from Earth and has a mass of 6.5 billion times that of the sun. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. EHT telescope2. Black hole3.

The spacecraft will focus on three possible landing sites in the area. These are  Posidonius 1, 2 or 3.Once the probe lands, it will use a magnetometer to measure the magnetism of moon rocks, according to an Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs news release This is to get a better understanding of how and when the lunar body acquired its magnetic field. If successful, Israel will become the fourth country to land a probe on the moon. Previously, nations such as the former Soviet Union, the United States and China have landed a spacecraft on the moon.

According to research presented at the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology's annual meeting, hydrogen peroxide, an ingredient present in over-the-counter whitening strips, may be damaging one of the layers of your teeth.Teeth have three layers  a thin outer layer called enamel, an underlying layer called dentin, and a connective tissue that binds the teeth's roots to the gum. Most of our teeth are made up of dentin which contains high levels of collagen protein.Researchers placed whitening strips on extracted human teeth coated with artificial saliva for about an hour or as instructed on the whitening product's description. After the strips were removed the teeth were washed for an hour and examined.

Now they are planning to bring its species back to life. According to The Siberian Times, a group of scientists from Russia and South Korea want to clone an extinct horse species by extracting DNA from the frozen remains of a  foal that died 42,170 years ago in Siberia.The foal's body was found in the permafrost of a Siberian crater called Batagaika in Yakutia, Russia. It was found to be part of the Lenskaya breed which went extinct about 4,000 years ago.The team has attempted to extract cells from the foal to create a cloned embryo. The extracted cells are first cultivated in a growth medium, a substance that encourages the growth of microorganisms. They are then placed in a CO2 incubator.  If successful, the embryo would be implanted in a South Korean horse. Scientists are also considering using a Yakut horse, an Eastern Siberian breed, as a surrogate mother. According to Dr. Semyon Grigoryev, a leading researcher at the Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk, it is possible to successfully harvest DNA from the foal, stating, quote, "Fortunately, the animal's muscle tissues were undamaged and well preserved, so we managed to get samples of this unique find for biotechnology research.The Siberian Times reports that the team has attempted to obtain usable cells over 20 times in the last month.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Though it is effective, using viruses runs the risk of provoking an immune response or initiating tumors.Researchers from Nanjing University and Xiamen University have developed a light carrier system consisting of nanoparticles that absorb and convert low-energy near-infrared radiation to ultraviolet light.NIR light can penetrate human tissue to reach the nanoparticles deep in the body, while UV can cut light-sensitive molecules to untether the CRISPR-Cas9.To test the system, nanoparticles were injected directly into the tumors of mice. When researchers shone NIR toward the location of the growth, it was converted to UV, which then released the CRISPR package.The gene-editing tool stopped a protein associated with cancer cells like it was programmed to, resulting in a reduction in tumor growth.The research is published in Science Advances. According to author Yujun Song, the team is focused on nanomedicine and disease treatment. They hope to apply the tool not just to cancer, but also to Parkinson's and diabetes.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to MIT Technology Review, the researchers found that the modified monkeys did better on memory tests involving colors and block pictures.They also noted the modified monkeys' brains took longer to develop, similar to human babies.None of the monkeys developed abnormally large brains.The Chinese scientists claim the modified monkeys have the potential to provide insight into understanding unique human traits.However, others such as James Sikela, from the University of Colorado who wasn't involved with the study, told MIT Technology Review, "the use of transgenic monkeys to study human genes linked to brain evolution is a very risky road to take."

According to a recent study by MIT published in the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, ponds roughly 10 to 100 centimeters deep may have provided better conditions for primitive life forms to develop due to their high levels of nitrogen in the form of nitrogenous oxides.Nitrogenous oxides are a result of lightning strikes splitting nitrogen bonds in the atmosphere and are hypothesized to be part of the creation of life. A hypothesis states that life was developed when nitrogenous oxides and primitive RNA mixed, creating amino acids that would later become living organisms.The study found that ultraviolet light from the Sun and dissolved iron from rocks could have diluted concentrations of nitrogenous oxides in the ocean due to its large volume.Shallow bodies of water like ponds and puddles, on the other hand, could have held higher concentrations of the nitrogenous oxides and RNA molecules, allowing them to mix more easily and develop into living organisms.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANLast Saturday, SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule exploded after suffering what the company referred to as an 'anomaly' during engine tests in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Here is how the launch abort systems work in case of emergency.According to Space.com, crewed launch missions are usually aborted through either the 'pull' or 'push' method. The 'pull' method is the oldest abort mechanism. Capsules that use this method have rocket boosters on the tip of the capsule. These thrusters pull the capsule away from the rocket in the event of a mission abort.Newer capsules, such as SpaceX's Crew Dragon use the 'push' mechanism. The Crew Dragon has thrusters mounted on the exterior of the capsule's wall and eight SuperDraco engines installed in the hull. These engines help 'push' the capsule away from the rocket. According to SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, these thrusters and the parachutes installed in the Crew Dragon are designed to help secure a safe landing. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner also uses a 'push' mechanism similar to the one on the Crew Dragon, however, their capsules are equipped with four RS-88 engines built by Aerojet Rocketdyne.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It originates in the Earth's core. Whenever there is movement in the core, Earth's magnetic field shifts. When these movements occur suddenly, they are called geomagnetic jerks.According to a new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience, Earth's sudden magnetic shifts may be caused by floating blobs of molten matter originating from the depths of the Earth's core.The team of researchers developed a computer simulation that mimics movements on the Earth's outer core over several decades, effectively recreating the conditions that take place right before a geomagnetic jerk will happen.Results showed that the sudden jerks happened when the Earth's inner core emitted hydromagnetic waves. As these waves move outwards and reach the surface of the Earth's core they become amplified and create movements that can be compared to geomagnetic jerks.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This theory suggests that the moon is a result of a collision between early Earth and another embryonic planet roughly the size of Mars called Theia.Computer simulations indicate that if this theory were true, 60 percent of the moon would be made from sediments from Theia. However, samples of lunar material show more similarities with sediments from Earth.A new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience poses another hypothesis. Researchers participating in the study explain that roughly 50 million years ago early Earth was covered in magma when it was hit by a solid object.Through a computer simulation, they observed that as the object hit Earth, magma from the Earth's surface expanded and went into orbit, forming the moon.According to their model, roughly 80 percent of the resulting moon is made up of proto-Earth materials.Study lead author Natsuki Hosono told Space.com, "prior work on lunar formation basically ignored the effect of the magma ocean.

The railway is expected to be fully operational in December 2021.The project is part of the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese development strategy involving infrastructure development and investment in 152 countries.   According to an NPR report, the total cost of building the high-speed railroad is $6 billion, of which China will pay 70 percent. The Laotian government will finance the rest of the project through loans from Chinese financial institutions.Chinese authorities claim that building the railroad will bring economic prosperity to the country, however, locals have told NPR that those who were removed from their lands for construction haven't received proper compensation. And Chinese tourists that have come to Laos mostly shop in businesses and restaurants owned by Chinese residents.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Size of railroad and speed of highspeed trains2.
