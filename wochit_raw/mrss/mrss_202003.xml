Officials said they discovered hundreds of sandbags at the end of the tunnel blocking what is suspected to be an old exit to the city of San Diego.U.S. authorities also uncovered an incomplete offshoot from the main cross-border tunnel leading into the U.S.The tunnel housed an extensive transport system including an elevator at the entrance and a rail system. The cross-border tunnel was also found to contain an air ventilation system, a drainage system and high voltage electrical cables.U.S. officials have yet to make any arrests regarding the discovery of the tunnel.Previously, authorities had found a 2,966-foot-long tunnel in San Diego in 2014.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Greening usually involves intensive land use for farming, planting trees at a large scale or natural reforestation of lands that have been abandoned. The study found that roughly half of Earth's vegetated land has been greened due to this technique.For the study, scientists analyzed satellite images from the 1980s to the 2010s. They noticed an increase of greening in China and India over the decades due to afforestation efforts.As green leaves convert sunlight to sugar, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is replaced with water vapor which cools Earth's surface. In the study, researchers explained that global greening may have slowed the rate of global warming by roughly 0.2 to 0.23 degrees Celsius.Study authors Shilong Piao and Xuhui Wang, explained in a Boston University news release that this provides "credible evidence" that human activities are dramatically impacting Earth's climate.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to a report by Mirror Media, Taiwan's first response to the novel coronavirus came on December 31, when China reported 27 cases of a mysterious Wuhan pneumonia to the WHO.Direct flights from Wuhan became subject to onboard health screening, and passengers had to declare their health status.It wasn't until January 21 that the island nation reported its first confirmed case. A 55-year-old businesswoman who returned to Taiwan from Wuhan was brought directly to the hospital upon arrival.Taiwan's second step was made on January 15, when the country's Centers for Disease Control listed the Wuhan pneumonia as a Category 5 communicable disease.According to Focus Taiwan, this made it mandatory to report suspected cases within 24 hours. Quarantining those who exhibited symptoms also became compulsory.When a man in Kaohsiung neglected to report viral symptoms after returning from Wuhan, the government fined him NT$300,000, or about US$10,000.On January 16, Taiwan's CDC raised the travel alert for Wuhan, after a Taiwanese expert team sent to the city to observe the epidemic suspected the possibility of human-to-human transmission.As of February 6, Taiwan has 13 confirmed cases of the virus.

Pluto's heart shaped Tombaugh Regio is a vast structure made of nitrogen ice and its left lobe Sputnik Planitia contains 1,000 km of ice sheet within its 5 km basin.During the day, a thin layer of the frozen nitrogen evaporates in relative heat; at night, the gas condenses and returns to icy form.The sequence pumps nitrogen wind through Pluto's atmosphere like rhythmic heartbeats.As nitrogen in Tombaugh Regio vaporizes in the north and freeze into ice in the south, the process triggers a westerly wind.Citing the study's authors, Phys.org says this behavior is unique in the entire solar system with perhaps the exception of Neptune's moon Triton.The study's other discovery is that Sputnik Planitia's high cliffs trap winds within the basin before releasing the strengthened currents to the west.The atmospheric movement is similar to certain wind patterns on Earth, such as the Kuroshio in Eastern Asia.

The insects are said to threaten more than 10 million people in the region.These young locusts are expected to mature and develop wings in the coming weeks. They are then expected to make their way to Ethiopia and Kenya.Somalia has become the first country in east Africa to declare an emergency over locust infestation, BBC News reports. Kenya and Ethiopia are already taking precautionary measures by using planes to spray pesticides to prevent a locust outbreak.The locust outbreak follows a period of unusually heavy rains and a powerful cyclone off the coast of Somalia at the end of 2019, the Associated Press reports, citing climate experts. According to the report, more rains are expected in the next few weeks. This means that the number of locusts could increase.Dominique Burgeon, the Food and Agriculture Organization's emergency and resilience director, explained another generation of the insect could now even be born in regular moisture conditions due to the high density of locusts.He said that without enough planes spraying to stop the locust swarms, the outbreak may even turn into a plague, which could take years to control.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Grijalva described the project as "sacrilegious" and says the Tohono O'odham Nation was not consulted by the government beforehand.Under the 2005 REAL ID act, the federal government has the right to waive laws that get in the way of national security.

This included new short-range and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, according to the report. It mentioned that North Korea has continued to "develop infrastructure and capacity" to enhance its missile program.The U.N. report says that the country also exported tons of commodities such as coal using Chinese barges, even though North Korea has been banned from doing so since 2017. DPRK-flagged vessels would transfer over the commodities to local Chinese barges, a method known as ship-to-ship transfer, which would then deliver the goods to ports in Hangzhou Bay and the Yangtze River in China.In a statement, China called the accusations "baseless," and said that it is implementing U.N. sanctions against North Korea.According to the report, North Korea also continued to illegally import refined petroleum using the same method.The country has been allowed to import 500,000 barrels of refined petroleum under current sanctions, but the report found that North Korea exceeded the limit "many times over," between January 1 and October 31 of last year, reports Reuters. North Korea's allies, Russia and China, have both raised concerns saying that the U.N. sanctions are causing harm to civilians in North Korea, according to Reuters. The United States, France and Great Britain have all said that sanctions should not be lifted.North Korea has been sanctioned by the United Nations since 2006, Reuters reports.

The report also found that a rise in nuclear power and a weaker demand for electricity resulted in lower carbon emissions.In comparison, usage of coal-fired plants in advanced economies last year had declined by nearly 15 percent.The report also found that carbon emissions rose sharply in southeast Asia due to an increased demand of coal. China and India were found to have moderate emissions growth in 2019 due to slower economic growth and an increase in usage of renewable energy.In a statement, Fatih Birol, the International Energy Agency executive director, said that the halt in carbon emission growth provides optimism that climate change can be tackled this decade.A separate report from the United Nations stated that global emissions would have to be reduced by 7.6 percent every year until 2030 to prevent temperatures from rising to dangerously high levels which would "increase the frequency and intensity" of climate change.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Since tungsten migrates from a planet's mantle to its core during formation, scientists are led to believe that Mars formed rapidly in 2 to 4 million years.However, the institute's researchers say Mars is known to have experienced large collisions in its early formative history. According to their models, this would have scrambled Mars's mantle and created a heterogeneous, marbled structure.Subsequently, when later collisions on Mars sent meteorites to Earth, the debris would have contained an uneven quantity of tungsten. Using the new models, the paper's authors claim that Mars may have taken 20 million years to become fully formed.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

After filling out a Google form and being given a voter pin, they rank their preferences on a scannable paper ballot, which is then dropped into a ballot boxDuring caucus day on February 22, voters sign in at their local precincts and must then separate into groups based on which candidate they support. Candidates who receive less than 15 percent of the vite are deemed "non-viable" and disqualified. Their supporters can either go to a different candidate or remain uncommitted.Instead of the Shadow Inc. app used in Iowa, Nevada will use a Google Forms-based caucus calculator on the iPads.According to ABC, this will calculate totals by combining caucus day and early voting data, although precinct chairs will still be required to fill out back-up paper reporting sheets. Should the state deem it necessary to conduct a recount, these sheets will serve as their paper trail.As required by the DNC, three sets of results will be reported on caucus day: raw votes from the first alignment, raw votes from the final alignment, and county delegate results.A Nevada Democratic Official told ABC that the reporting process will include a two-source verification, with data first reported through "a secure hotline to a trained operator."

Biological methane, which comes from living sources such as animals, contains carbon-14. This chemical signature allowed researchers to distinguish natural emissions from man-made emissions over a period of 200 years, from before the Industrial Revolution started in the early 18th century to the present day.Researchers found that almost all methane that was emitted to earth's atmosphere until 1870 was biological in nature.After 1870, researchers found a roughly 25 to 40 percent increase of human-produced methane emissions.

Over 77,000 people have been infected, and 2,600 have died.South Korea currently has 830 confirmed cases – the largest number outside China. Eight have died, and 7,700 troops are now quarantined after at least 13 in the military were found to be infected.Most of the country's cases are in Daegu, where clusters have been linked to a hospital and a secretive religious group.The largest number of cases in Europe – at least 229 – are in Italy. To contain the outbreak, authorities have locked down several towns in the Lombardy and Veneto regions.Iran also has 61 confirmed cases, the majority of which is in the holy city of Qom.According to the BBC, cases have also been reported in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, all of which involve people who came from Iran.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>South Korean COVID-19 infections linked to secretive religious cult</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions or custom animation requests, contact tips@nextanimation.com.tw. Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANCoronavirus infection cases have surged in South Korea, with more than half linked to a religious cult whose secretive nature is said to have helped the virus spread undetected. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,146 confirmed COVID-19 infections in the country as of February 26. Majority are located in the city of Daegu and neighboring Cheongdo county, where they are centered around a hospital and the Shincheonji church of Jesus.The New York Times reports that the link to many of the cases is a 61-year-old woman known as Patient No. 31. Despite presenting a fever and sore throat, she initially refused to be tested for the virus, and attended several Shincheonji church gatherings before testing positive.Church members sit packed together on the floor during services and are not allowed to wear glasses or face masks. Citing South Korean health officials, the BBC reports that any gathering in such a confined space attended by Patient No. 31 would likely have led to more infections.Another cluster at a hospital in Cheongo has also been associated with the church. According to the New York Times, a large number of followers attended a funeral at a hall owned by the hospital. Over 100 patients and staff have since tested positive for the virus.Health officials learned that Patient No. 31 had also been in Cheongdo in early February. She told Newsis she hadn't visited the funeral or the hospital, only a public bathhouse.Shincheonji is considered a cult by many in South Korea, so members typically hide their membership from non church members. This, along with the belief that being sick is a weakness, has made it more difficult for authorities to track down those who have been infected, according to the BBC.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
