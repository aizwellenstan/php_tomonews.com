The stabbings occurred around 20:50 GMT when a 25-year-old suspect attacked a man and woman in their 50s, according to the Greater Manchester Police. The woman suffered injuries to her face and stomach, while the man sustained wounds to his stomach. A British Transport Police officer, who responded to the scene, was also stabbed in the shoulder. All three victims' injuries were described as "serious" but not life-threatening. The police officer was released from the hospital on Tuesday. According to witnesses,  police used pepper spray and a Taser to detain the attacker, who had been resisting arrest. Six or seven police officers were seen on top of the suspect, before he was finally arrested. According to the BBC, two knives were recovered at the scene and a residence is being searched in the Cheetham Hill area.  The attacker is currently being held on the suspicion of attempted murder.

Stratovolcanoes form through the accumulation of layers of viscous lava and ash through multiple eruptions.According to Volcano Discovery, the volcano has been active since around 1928. Its eruptions are strombolian.According to Science Magazine, strombolian eruptions occur when gas inside the volcano form bubbles called gas slugs. Gas slugs then rise through the magma column and throw magma into the air when they burst.Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation has analyzed images of the volcano from a number of radar satellites, including the European Union's Sentinel-1 constellation, the German TerraSAR-X platform, and Japan's Space agency. These show Anak Krakatoa, which used to stand at roughly 340 meters high, now just measuring 110 meters. According to AFP, the steady eruptions caused rock and ash from the volcano to gradually slide into the sea causing it to lose about 150 and 180 million cubic meters of material. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

In serious cases, it can cause death within 6 to 13 days.The disease is spread through direct contact with infected pigs. It could also be spread through indirect contact if the pigs consume contaminated food waste.China has already reported more than 90 cases of African Swine Fever since August last year.The deadly virus could survive in processed pork for a few months. It could also survive for years in frozen pig carcasses, according to the Guardian.China previously banned the transport of pigs from outbreak regions, but continues to allow pigs from unaffected regions to be freely transported to other areas in the country.Beijing also banned the use of food waste and pig blood in the production of pig feed in September 2018.African Swine Fever is fatal for pigs but the disease does not harm humans.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It was reportedly done to "challenge excessive maritime claims." China responded by dispatching military aircraft and naval vessels to identify the U.S. destroyer and warn it to leave the area.According to Al Jazeera, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang claims the U.S. ship "violated Chinese and international law, infringed on Chinese sovereignty, and undermined peace and stability."The South China Sea has long been contentious. Several countries have competing claims based on their exclusive economic zones, but China claims the entire body based on historic rights, using a nine-dash line to demarcate its territory.Since 2013, China has been building artificial islands in both the Paracels and Spratlys to bolster its claim.Washington has also expressed opposition over Beijing's militarization of the South China Sea, and its addition of military installations like radars and airstrips to islands and reefs.China has defended the construction as necessary for self defense, alleging that the U.S. is the one to blame for heightening tensions in the area with their patrols.This latest incident comes as talks between the two sides get underway in Beijing, following a 90-day truce on a bitter trade war that saw import tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Chief Justice John Roberts, Ginsburg did not attend oral arguments, but will participate in the cases and rulings by using the briefs and oral arguments, Reuters reported. Ginsburg underwent a pulmonary lobectomy on Dec. 21 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to remove two cancerous nodules in her left lung and was released from the hospital on Christmas Day. According to Health, the procedure removes one-half to one-third of the lung. The lung tissue removed does not regenerate, but the upper portion of the lungs helps to compensate. According to Raja Flores, MD, chair of thoracic surgery for Mount Sinai Health System and director of the thoracic surgical oncology program at the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai taking to Health, it can take patients anywhere from a few weeks to three months to recover from a pulmonary lobectomy. Patients are trained practice deep breathing and coughing exercises to help the lungs re-expand post-operation. Some may also need additional oxygen while recovering in the hospital.This was Ginsburg's third cancer diagnosis. She broke three ribs in a November fall, which led physicians to discover the cancer in her lung. According to a statement from the Supreme Court, there is currently no signs of any cancer in Ginsburg's body and that no further treatment is needed at this time.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This stage of the sleep cycle is also thought to be important for memory consolidation.According to study author Brendan Lucey, those who showed increased tau pathology slept more at night and napped during the day, but were not getting good quality sleep.While the findings are significant, the study is unclear on whether poor quality sleep is a cause or consequence of pathological changes in the brain.Researchers suggest, however, that sleep disruptions may be an effective tool for doctors to spot patients in the earliest stages of cognitive decline.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The site has been disputed between Hindus and Muslims ever since it was built in the 16th Century.Supporters of the current government are pushing for a temple of the hindu god Ram to be built in place of the ruins of Babri Masjid, especially since elections are to take place in May, Reuters reports. This was one of the key promises Prime Minister Narendra Modi made during his previous election campaign, according to BBC News.Babri Masjid was built in the city of Ayodhya during the Mughal era. Hindu mobs tore it down in 1992. This triggered communal riots in the country and killed around 2,000 people. Today the site is in ruins, with a tiny makeshift Ram temple in its place.Hindus claim the mosque was built on the site of the birthplace of Lord Ram. However, several Hindu nationalists want to build a fully fledged temple of Ram in its place.The Allahabad High Court previously ruled that the land should be divided in three parts, reported the Times of India.  One for the Hindu deity, one for a Hindu-nationalist group and one for the Sunni Waqf Board. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Ayodhya on a map.1. Babri masjid then and now2. A tiny Ram temple in its place3.

The wings analyzed were from specimens caught in the wild and from specimens preserved in museums.The researchers found it takes three generations of green darners to complete an annual migratory cycle.The first migration occurs between February and March. Dragonflies depart from southern United States, Mexico and the Caribbean by May they reach the upper Midwest. The first generation lays its eggs there and dies.Dragonflies from the second generation head South again once they reach maturity and deposits another batch of eggs when they arrive at their destination.The third and last generation does not migrate but produces another batch of eggs that will restart the cycle once again the following spring.Researchers have not yet understood how migratory insects know what path to take during their migration cycles. Although climate change may pose a threat to this natural process.Researchers participating in the study stated, "further research is needed to determine how a changing climate may alter the migratory schedules and annual cycle of dragonflies and other migratory insects."

According to UPI, the study published on Jan. 14 found that chronic lack of sleep or poor sleep quality were associated with increased chances of atherosclerosis, a condition where fatty plaque accumulates in the arteries which can lead to heart attack or stroke. For the study, lead researcher Jose Ordovas from the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid and his team tracked around 4,000 Spanish adults using coronary ultrasound and CT scans to monitor artery health. Participants did not have a prior history of heart disease at the start of the study and had an average age of 46. Researchers was unable to prove cause and effect, but they found people who slept less than six hours a night were 27 percent more likely to have body-wide atherosclerosis than those who slept seven to eight hours a night.

Even though foie gras was banned in 2004, full enforcement of the ban only started in 2012. Legal challenges resulted in it being suspended and reinstated numerous times over the past six years in California, according to SFGate.Now, it is illegal to sell or produce foie gras in California as the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case against the ban.Violators of the ban will be fined up to US$1,000 if they are caught selling foie gras.To make foie gras, a metal tube is forced down the throat of a duck or a goose to enable forced feeding. This process is called "gavage," according to One Green Planet.org.The animals are then force-fed grain until their liver fattens to 10 times its size. The animals are eventually then slaughtered and their liver is cooked into a pate.The Animal Legal Defense Fund's staff attorney Kelsey Eberly told SFGate that they were "absolutely thrilled" at the Supreme Court's decision to not hear the case against the ban.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Hasher Jallal Taheb, 21, is accused of attempting to damage or destroy the White House by means of fire or an explosive, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, reports the Washington Post. According to the complaint, the FBI started investigating Taheb in March after an unidentified citizen informed authorities that he had "become radicalized, changed his name and made plans to travel abroad." According to court papers, an FBI informant and an undercover FBI agent then befriended Taheb, and through conversations, the suspect told them his plan to "blow a hole in the White House" so the three could carry out an attack with guns and grenades. On Wednesday, Taheb, the informant and the undercover agent met in a Buford, Georgia parking lot to exchange their cars for guns, an antitank weapon and explosives, according to the criminal complaint. According to officials, the weapons were all rendered inert as part of the sting operation. Taheb was arrested after the transaction was completed.

That's almost four times bigger than the Large Hadron Collider or LHC.The conceptual design report predicts it would take approximately 20 years to design and build the new collider. The report highlights the importance of building it at the right time to ensure the continuation of particle research after the LHC stops operating in 2035.According to the report, the collider would be built in phases. During its early stages, it would collide electrons and positrons. Later it would collide electrons against the nuclei of lead atoms.The team hopes that by 2050 the FCC will be able to carry out proton-proton collisions with an energy of 100 teraelectronvolts[a]. That is seven times the energy capacity of the LHC.Plans for the collider also include a radiofrequency acceleration system, large scale cryogenic plants and 16 tesla high-field accelerator magnets.

One of the last things the Cassini spacecraft did before plunging into Saturn's atmosphere in 2017 was to travel between the planet and its rings, acting as a gravity probe.  NASA programmed Cassini to perform 22 dives between the planet and the rings, with earth-based radio telescopes measuring the spacecraft's velocity to within a fraction of a millimeter per second. Based on how much Cassini's flight path was deflected by the gravity of the rings, researchers were able to make an accurate estimate of Saturn ring mass. Previous research has shown a relationship between the mass of the rings and their age. Lower mass would point to a younger age, because the rings are initially made of ice and are bright, but over time become contaminated and darkened by interplanetary debris. With that estimate, scientist calculated that the rings are relatively recent, having originated between 100 million years to 10 million years ago. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Reuters, suspected fuel thieves punctured the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline a few miles from one of the country's main refineries on Friday, causing a large jet of fuel to rise into the air.  According to authorities, around 800 people scrambled to fill up containers from the 23-foot (7 meter) gasoline geyser.   A few hours later, the geyser erupted in flames in a powerful explosion.During a press conference, Pemex chief executive Octavio Romero said the company was aware of a leak along the pipeline at around 16:50 local time. According to BBC, locals said President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's new policy to crack down on fuel theft has created shortages.  Mexico says fuel theft cost the country about US$3 billion just last year. President López Obrador has said he will continue his anti-theft policy until the illegal practice was stopped.

According to a press release by the company, it's first satellite will gather data on the environment of the Earth's atmosphere in order to determine the feasibility of creating an artificial meteor shower.The satellite was launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency on the Epsilon-4 rocket along with six other tech demo satellites. According to The Japan Times, the cost per launch of the Epsilon-4 is $50 million.The satellite is designed to imitate a meteor shower by firing small 1-centimeter metal pellets at high-speed into the Earth's atmosphere.The space venture company states that the pellets will not cause any damage to existing satellites or air crafts because they will completely burn up at 60 to 80 kilometers above ground. Airplanes fly at an altitude of 10 kilometers.During a meteor shower show, the pellets will travel one-fifth of the way around Earth before entering the atmosphere. On average, five to twenty pellets will be released, each of which will remain visible for roughly three to ten seconds.The company hopes to create its first artificial meteor shower show above the city of Hiroshima. According to ALE, the shower will be visible to over 6 million people in an area of up to 200 kilometers.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Satellite launches on the Epsilon-4 into Earth's orbit2.

According to The Washington Post, almost half of the employees from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is responsible for updating the World Magnetic Model, are on furlough due to the government shutdown, as the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives refuses to fund U.S. President Donald Trump's $5 billion border wall.Earth's poles naturally shift and change due to unpredictable flows of molten liquid iron at the Earth's core caused by the planet's rotation. This liquid's movement creates the Earth's magnetic field. However, an article posted in the journal Nature shows that the Earth's magnetic North Pole has been moving at an unprecedented rate. The movement began in the mid-1990s and it is now headed towards Siberia at roughly 55 kilometers per year.Scientists from the NOAA and the British Geological Survey study and update the World Magnetic Model every five years.However, due to the dramatic movement, the model needs to be updated earlier than scheduled. The current government shutdown has forced the NOAA to postpone the update from January 15 to January 30.This model is necessary for accurate civilian and military navigation. According to the report, the abrupt changes may be due to a geomagnetic pulse that occurred beneath South America in 2016.In 2017, Phil Livermore a geophysicist from the University of Leeds detected a high-speed jet of liquid iron beneath Canada that seemed to be weakening the magnetic field in that area. Livermore believes this could be linked to the current changes in the earth's magnetic field.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Flow of Earth's core2. Movement of magnetic North Pole over the years3.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANScientists have developed a new carbon capture system that absorbs CO2 and produces useable electricity and hydrogen fuel, according to New Atlas. Researchers from Georgia Tech and Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology designed the device using the ocean's carbon sink ability as inspiration, and published their results in the journal Science in Nov. 2018. According to New Atlas, the device is called the Hybrid Na-CO2 System and is in essence a large liquid battery. A sodium metal anode is place in an organic electrolyte, while the cathode is placed in an aqueous solution. The two liquids are separated by a sodium Super Ionic Conductor membrane. When carbon dioxide is pumped into the aqueous electrolyte, it reacts with the cathode, turning the solution more acidic, which then generates electricity and creates hydrogen. During testing, the system reported a CO2 conversion efficiency of 50 percent and was able to run for over 1,000 hours without damage to the electrodes. Another benefit of the system is that no CO2 is released during the process. The leftover CO2 from the electrolyte is recovered as baking soda. For carbon capture systems to become practical however, they would need to be produced at a much larger scales in order to have an impact on reducing levels of atmospheric CO2. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

For life to occur on a planet, volatile elements including carbon, nitrogen and sulfur must be present. According to the study, a catastrophic collision between Earth while it was still forming and a Mars-sized object with volatile elements could explain how these elements were introduced. Researchers used a combination of high-temperature, high-pressure experiments to mimic these conditions in the lab. The results were then fed into computer simulations that were able to determine the size and chemical composition of the impacting planet.

The infusion would be accompanied by a tone and a light.According to the paper published in the journal Cell Reports, the rats would then associate the tone and light with the cocaine high and would exhibit drug-seeking behavior by repeatedly pressing the lever.The team studied electrical recordings from rat brain tissue and found essential connections between the medial geniculate nucleus and the lateral amygdala. These connections created memories that associated the cocaine high with external cues.The team then used a biological technique called optogenetics to erase memories related to cocaine use.

The terms "weather" and "climate" are not interchangeable. Weather refers to daily variations in temperature, precipitation, wind and other variables. According to the NOAA, climate is the average weather conditions of an area over at least a 30-year period."Global warming refers to the gradual increase of the Earth's average temperature. The sudden rise in temperature in recent years is primarily attributed to the increasing presence of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone.Climate change refers to changes in weather patterns in Earth over an extended period of time. These changes are natural, however, activities including fossil fuel combustion, land use, deforestation, and agriculture magnify these changes.Research published in 2018 in Nature Communications explained that the record-breaking cold weather and polar vortex disruptions are caused by Arctic warming. Fast flowing air currents located in the Earth's northern hemisphere called jet streams are responsible for weather fluctuations around the globe.These winds move from east-to-west and are pushed by the difference in temperature between Arctic and tropical air. Higher temperatures in the Arctic make the jetstream move further south. This fluctuation causes places located to the south of the Arctic to experience colder winters.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Rescuers found the boy's bag of sweets and a cup when they lowered a camera down around 75 meters into the well.The Spanish Civil Guard stated that rescuers did attempt to widen the hole, reported NBC, citing TVE.They reportedly attempted this while also trying to dig an alternate shaft in order to connect the two tunnels and rescue the baby. The rescuers have now finished digging a second vertical shaft in an effort to reach the boy, El Pais reports. They were originally planning to go down using a cage to dig a horizontal tunnel into the first shaft.However, the cage got stuck 40 meters down the shaft. They were aiming to reach 60 meters depth. A rescue team are now planning to dig 4 meters to connect with the first shaft. Each of them will work in 40 to 60 minute shifts. It will take around 24 hours for them to connect to the first borehole, according to El Pais.Rescuers have yet to locate the boy.

A positive NAO is linked to mild and wet winters in Europe, while a negative NAO indicates a snowy and cold winters.According to Columbia University, published research in recent years claims the NAO is linked to the solar cycle, a periodic, 11-year change during which the sun's activity increases then ebbs.The theory indicates that the connection between the two is strong enough to inform predictions of the NAO by up to a decade in advance.But using computer modeling and extended observations, scientists at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and Columbia's School of Engineering found no evidence of any correlation prior to 1960. The apparent correlation had been due to atmospheric variability, and not the sun.The correlation theory would have proven advantageous to Northern hemisphere societies, as it would have allowed them to plan for intense flooding and storms.But the research debunking the link is also important for future climate research, now that it appears the causes for decadal weather changes lie elsewhere.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

With no BMAL1 to help manage their circadian rhythm, the resulting monkeys exhibited "a wide range of circadian disorder phenotypes."After taking a fibroblast from the gene-edited monkey, scientists used somatic cell nuclear transfer to replace the nucleus of a monkey egg cell with the fibroblast nucleus.Three hundred and twenty-five embryos were implanted in 65 surrogate monkeys. This resulted in 16 pregnancies but only five live births.All five cloned monkeys carried the altered BMAL1 gene introduced in the donor monkey. They also showed the same circadian disorder symptoms, such as reduced sleep, increased night activity, increased anxiety and depression, and schizophrenia-like behaviors.The Chinese team claims the identical specimens could be useful in studying disease pathogenesis and treatment. Cloning genetically altered animals could also reduce the number needed for research.But the experiment raises many ethical concerns, especially with regard to animal rights. A video showing the five monkeys behaving erratically has been widely described as disturbing.According to Futurism, scientists are also questioning whether insight gleaned from such research would even translate to humans, since many animal studies do not.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
