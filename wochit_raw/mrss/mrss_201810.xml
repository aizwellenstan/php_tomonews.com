The vessel was also reported to be more than 177 meters long, according to the Marine Traffic website.According to AFP, the bad weather caused the cables attached to the ship broke as the ship neared the Yangon River. This is when the crew decided to abandon the ship.Myanmar Navy officials decided to use coastal radar records to track down the approximate location of the two vessels, Fox News reports.Officials involved in the case are still investigating further, as the ship's last recorded location was reportedly off the coast of Taiwan before appearing in Myanmar waters.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers on board the research vessel (RV) Atlantis have discovered a deep-sea coral reef about 160 miles off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. According to HuffPost, a human-operated submersible named Alvin was deployed from the RV Atlantis, and its cameras discovered enormous cold-water coral populations about 0.5 miles below the ocean surface.Scientists used Alvin to explore the reef and collect coral samples on Aug. 23 and Aug. 24. The team found large amounts of Lophelia pertusa, a branching, whitish coral found in cold waters. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), L. pertusa can survive in deep-seas by using stinging tentacles to stun its prey and guide food into its stomach.  The corals found by the Atlantis were located about 16 miles to the northwest of corals found earlier in the summer by the NOAA RV Okeanos Explorer. The coral-covered area explored by the Okeanos and the Atlantis run for an estimated 85 miles, layered with massive, rocky piles of dead coral likely accumulated over many thousands of years, according to expedition lead scientist Erik Cordes, reported HuffPost.

According to the CBC, the warm water doesn't float in the Arctic because its saltiness makes it sink. Instead, the colder, fresh water sits near the sea ice.However, the researchers warn the trapped hot water has the potential to "come to the surface" and "impact the ice."The researchers explain this could happen if the waters become so warm, they stop sinking and begin mixing with the cold, fresh water near the sea ice.The Arctic is already warning at twice the rate of the global average, this would only exacerbate the dire situation in the polar region.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

People who suffer from phenylketonuria, or PKU, must avoid dietary protein in foods like meat and cheese, because their bodies cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine, or Phe. The study, published on August 13 in Nature Biotechnology, showed that the probiotic can significantly lower Phe levels in both mouse models of PKU and in healthy monkeys, according to The Scientist. The treatment is called SYNB1618 and is a modified version of the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle. Researchers say treatment with SYNB1618 is a two-step process. The first step is to get patients' blood Phe under control. The second step is to relax the diet and slowly add natural protein into their diet. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA 55-year-old woman developed a case of black hairy tongue after taking an antibiotic for an infected wound.The case was published by Dr. Yasir Hamad, an assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, according to CNN. The condition refers to when papillae on the tongue grow longer than normal and turn black. Papillae are normally less than a millimeter long, but can grow to between 12 and 18 millimeters in length in patients suffering from the condition. The blackening occurs as the growing papillae trap microscopic food particles that allow bacteria and other microbes to flourish on the tongue. Black hairy tongue is an uncommon and harmless side effect of some drugs, but can also be caused by smoking, bad oral hygiene and some medical conditions. In this case, the woman was taking minocycline to treat a wound infection from a car accident. Within a week, her tongue turned black, she started feeling nauseous and developed a foul taste in her mouth. Four weeks after doctors changed her medication, her tongue turned back to its normal color.    RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Woman developing black hairy tongue after taking antibiotic2.

Delaney Unger, 12, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left knee in 2016, which would require chemotherapy and amputation of her knee, according to CNN. Because of the location of her Unger's cancer, doctors were able to perform a rare procedure called a rotationplasty. During a 13-hour surgery in April of 2017, she had her left knee completely amputated. Surgeons then took Unger's ankle and foot, rotated them 180 degrees and attached them to the stump of her thigh, according to Newsday. This allowed her ankle to function as a knee. In October of 2017, Unger, who is now cancer free, received a prosthetic which fits over the backward-oriented foot and extends up the thigh. The prosthesis lets her walk, jump and dance.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers have found that plants communicate distress by using their own signaling system. University of Wisconsin-Madison Professor of Botany Simon Gilroy and his lab revealed how glutamate activates a wave of calcium that spreads across leaves to warn of danger in a paper published on Sept. 13 in the journal Science. "We know there's this systematic signaling system, and if you wound in one place the rest of the plant triggers its defense responses," said Gilroy, speaking to the University of Wisconsin's news service. "But we didn't know what was behind this system." "We do know if you wound a leaf, you get an electrical charge, and you get a propagation that moves across the plant," he added. The scientists wanted to know what triggered the electric charge, and how it moved throughout the plant. Calcium was one possibility, but the researchers needed to be able to see calcium in real time, so special plants were developed the produce a protein that only fluoresces around calcium. The team then subjected the plants to caterpillar bites, scissor cuts and crushing wounds and used video to track the responses.In response to each type of distress, videos show the plants lighting up as calcium spreads from the site of damage to other leaves. The signal spread to the other leaves in a few minutes, which was then followed by a spike in defense-related hormones in distant leaves. The scientists were then able to pinpoint glutamate as the trigger the sent out the waves of calcium. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Researchers finding out glutamate activates calcium wave in plants2.

According to the Associated Press, storm surges are more dangerous because of rising sea levels, with storms moving more slowly, thus increased levels of precipitation. The Associated Press talked with 17 meteorologists and researchers who study climate change, hurricanes or both.Dean of the environment school at the University of Michigan Jonathan Overpeck said, "Florence is yet another poster child for the human-supercharged storms that are becoming more common and destructive as the planet warms."Several months after Hurricane Harvey, studies found climate change significantly increased the chances for Harvey's record rain falls. Scientists say that for every degree the air warms, it can hold almost 4 percent more water and feeds more energy into the storm. University of Exeter climate scientist Peter Stott said the warmer air and water also make storms more intense or stronger. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Jim Kossin and Overpeck also mentioned that studies have shown storms intensifying more rapidly than before. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANCommonly used household disinfectants and multi-surface cleaners could be making children overweight by affecting their gut bacteria, according to a study published on Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.  Infants living in households where antimicrobial disinfectants were used at least once a week were twice as likely to have elevated levels of the bacteria Lachnospiraceae at ages 3 to 4 months than children whose homes did not use disinfectants frequently, according to CNN. According to Anita Kozyrskyj, lead author of the study, higher levels of Lachnospiraceae in animal studies have been associated with higher body fat and insulin resistance. Researchers collected stool samples from 757 infants and analyzed their body mass index, BMI, at older ages in addition to parental use of disinfectant products.Scientists found that around 80 percent of Canadian households use disinfectant products at least once a week.  While the team found an increase in Lachnospiraceae with increased antimicrobial disinfectants, they did not find the same association in disinfectants without the bacteria-killing ingredients or eco-friendly cleaners. "These results suggest that gut microbiota were the culprit in the association between disinfectant use and the overweight," said Kozyrskyj, according to CNN. Though the results show connection between disinfectants and the gut microbiome, that does not imply causation. According to Kozyrskyj, further studies need to be carried out to establish a causal relationship. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Disinfectants affecting an infant's gut bacteria2. Study parameters3.

Scientists from the University of Reading fed microplastics to mosquito larvae, and discovered the plastics remained inside the insects after they became adults. The study was published in the journal Biology Letters on Wednesday. Researchers used Culex pipiens mosquitoes because of their prevalence around many global habitats. The team found the larvae consumed fluorescent microplastic particles that were 0.0002 centimeters in size.  According to The Guardian, as the larvae matured into the pupa stage and then into adult mosquitoes, many of the particles were transferred as well. This means that creatures that eat the mosquitoes  such as birds, bats and spiders  are also ingesting the plastics. The lead author of the study, Amanda Callaghan, a biological scientist at Reading told the AFP, although the research was carried out in a lab, it was "highly possible" this process was also occurring in the wild.  "It's a very major problem and those plastics already in the environment are going to be with us for a very, very long time," Callaghan said.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The study followed more than 19,000 people ages 65 and older in the United States and Australia for an average of 4.7 years, according to NPR. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sunday. Participants were given 100 milligrams of aspirin daily or a placebo. According to NBC News, at the end of the trial period, 90.3 percent of the aspirin-treated patients were still alive, compared with 90.5 percent of those given placebos. The rates of physical disability and dementia were similar in both groups, while the rates of coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes were also similar. "We found there was no discernible benefit of aspirin on prolonging independent, healthy life for the elderly," said Anne Murray, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis, who helped lead the study, according to NPR. The study found a significant risk of internal gastric bleeding in the aspirin-treated group, as well as a slight increase in cancer deaths within the same group.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Sodium ions in a battery also tend to stick to the anode, building up into a solid electrolyte interface that can grow too large and hamper charging ability.To make sodium functional, Purdue University scientists used ultrasonic dispersion to melt it into a purple liquid. Once cooled into a powder, it is suspended in hexane for even particle distribution.A few drops of the suspension liquid on cathode or anode electrodes allows a sodium-ion battery to function with more stability, and at a higher capacity.According to Purdue assistant professor of chemical engineering Vilas Pol, adding in the sodium requires only minimal modifications to the battery production process, making it both promising and practical.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It also contains information such as the size and identity of the panda.Pandas have a short mating season as the female pandas only ovulate once a year and are able to conceive for only a few days in an year, according to the New York Times.The researchers recorded the bleats of giant pandas and tested how well the sound would travel through dense bamboo thickets.However, the researchers found that the bleat works best if a potential mate is less than 10 meters away.The study could help conservationists trying to encourage pandas to breed as their population continues to dwindle.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Only 50 grams of carbohydrates are allowed a day, compared to the USDA recommendation of 225 to 325 grams.The idea is to go into a state of ketosis, in which the body burns fat instead of carbohydrates for energy.But while a ketogenic diet helps reduce sugar and processed food intake, according to a study of overweight men published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, it doesn't necessarily burn more body fat.Dieters tend to eliminate healthier carbohydrates like bananas, legumes, or oats, and with them nutrients like magnesium, calcium, and potassium. Some of the findings suggest going low-carb could lead to glucose intolerance or even diabetes, though more research is needed to confirm this.Research that looked at eating patterns of U.S. adults found that those who ate a moderate amount of carbs were more likely to live longer than high or low carb eaters.A third study that surveyed Europeans' eating habits revealed that those who ate fewer fresh vegetables, fruits, and nuts are more likely to develop deadly cancers.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Business Insider, the multi-level, 89-by-89-foot complex will be floating in the water in Rotterdam. The floating dairy will have 40 cows and can produce around 211 gallons of milk daily. The bottom level of the facility will house the processing and packaging machinery, with the cows and milking robots on the second level, while the third floor will grow clover and grass for the cows to eat.  According to Minke van Wingerden, co-leader of the project, who spoke with Business Insider, the farm will try to recycle as much as possible. Cows will be fed leftover food waste from the city. The cows' manure will be processed and sold as fertilizer. She also said the floating farm can be made to be hurricane-resistant.

Large glaciers, such as Antarctica or the Arctic, compress the earth which causes the sides of the planet to bulge outward.As the glaciers start to melt, the land would gradually start to regain its original shape. This process is referred to as glacial rebound and was found to only be responsible for about 3.5 centimeters of axis wobble each year.Scientists used to believe glacial rebound was the main reason why Earth would wobble.NASA found the melting of the ice, fueled by the release of greenhouse gases, accounted for one third of Earth's wobble.Mantle convection also affects the planet's spin as molten rock rises and falls and can redistribute Earth's mass.NASA says the planet's wobble will continue to increase as the combination of these three factors continue to affect Earth.However, they added the wobble isn't large enough to impact ecosystems...for now.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the AFP, beginning last week, divers and a specially rigged boat have begun hauling out hundreds of old rubber tires about 500 meters from the coastline between Cannes and Antibes. The original idea was to have the tires serve as a sanctuary for marine life and as a foundation for coral to grow. According to Denis Genovese, head of an association of local fisherman, talking to the AFP, sedentary creatures did not use them, while "grouper fish, conger eels and sea bream swim around them." A University of Nice study in 2005 discovered that the tires were leaching toxic chemicals, including heavy metals, into the water.Another concern now is that after 40 years, the tires will break down into smaller pieces putting nearby seagrass meadows at risk. In 2015, 2,500 tires were removed to show that the clean up could be done safely. Around 10,000 tires are scheduled to be removed over the next few weeks, with the remaining 12,500 set to be pulled in the second quarter of 2019. The tires will be sent to recycling centers where they will be broken down into smaller pieces to be used in construction.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Boat and divers removing tires from water2.

According to the Washington Post, Katey Walter Anthony, an associate professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Esieh Lake is bubbling because of methane gas.  The gases are geological in origin. The researchers say there are fossil fuels buried close to the bottom of the lake, and in combination with the melting of the permafrost, represent a source of greenhouse gases.

The left trachea is more developed than the right, while the right esophagus is more developed than the left.Scientists say it's better for the right head to eat based on the snake's anatomy, but are attempting to feed the left head due to it being more dominant and responsive.Two-headed serpents are an extremely rare find in the wild as they often have trouble coordinating their movements when escaping from predators, which contribute to their short life spans.The competing heads also tend to fight over food, though this particular copperhead's mutation is such that its heads don't quarrel, and seem almost oblivious to each other.Herpetologists estimate the animal is about 3 weeks old, but have yet to figure out its gender.

PCBs can be consumed by plankton, which are then eaten by larger fish. As the PCBs move up the food chain, they become more concentrated. This puts killer whales in danger of consuming highly concentrated PCBs as they are near the top of the food chain. The chemical was found to disrupt the whales' reproductive system, brain function and the endocrine system.Mother whales can also pass the deadly chemicals on to their offspring through lactation.

The cells released the neurotransmitter glutamate, involved in conveying senses like taste or smell, which the neurons picked up on within 100 milliseconds.The findings could have massive implications on our understanding of appetite and how to suppress it. Current suppressants target slow-acting hormones, but going after the synapses may in fact be the more effective approach.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of enteroendocrine cells with protrusions similar to neurons2. Depiction of vagal nerves as a direct circuit connecting the gut to the brain3. Depiction of synaptic connection between enteroendocrine cells and vagal neurons 4. Depiction of neurotransmitter glutamate VOICEOVER (in English): "Enteroendocrine cells that line the gut have protrusions similar to neurons, leading researchers to suspect they may be sending signals to the brain via the vagus nerve.""When a fluorescent green rabies virus was injected into the colons of mice, the virus labeled the vagus nerve before landing in the brain stem, proving there was a direct circuit.""Enteroendocrine cells grown in the same petri dish as vagal neurons connected together and began firing signals.""The cells released the neurotransmitter glutamate, involved in conveying senses like taste or smell, which the neurons picked up on within 100 milliseconds."SOURCES: Duke University, Sciencehttps://today.duke.edu/2018/09/%E2%80%9Cgut-sense%E2%80%9D-hardwired-not-hormonalhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/your-gut-directly-connected-your-brain-newly-discovered-neuron-circuit***]]></description>
