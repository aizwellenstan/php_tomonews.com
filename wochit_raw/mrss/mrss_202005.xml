Their key components are RNA, the virus' genetic material; proteins that allow the virus to infect cells; and a lipid envelope that coats the virus. This lipid membrane has two rings of hydrophilic heads surrounding two layers of hydrophobic tails.Soap molecules destabilize a coronavirus because their hydrophobic tails are attracted to lipids in the virus' lipid bilayer. The soap molecules stick to lipids in the bilayer and pry them apart, encapsulating them in bubbles called micelles that wash away in the lather.In addition to disrupting the lipid membrane of the virus, soap molecules also disrupt the bonds that hold the proteins, lipids and viral RNA together. They effectively pull the virus apart, and the viral particles are rinsed away in water.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Soap molecule with hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail2.

Ventilators needed to keep some patients aliveVOICEOVER (in English): "The COVID-19 coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, spreads through droplets that people make when we talk, cough or sneeze. The virus can be carried for up to 27 feet and land on the respiratory system, according to a study in the Journal of American Medical Association.""A gene sequence study published in Frontiers in Medicine showed that the coronavirus targets human cells with ACE2 receptors. This means the epithelial cells in the lungs and other organs are vulnerable to the coronavirus.""The coronavirus has mutations in the spike proteins on its surface. The mutations to the receptor binding domains, or RBDs, allow the virus to use human ACE2 receptors as entry points for getting into the cell.""According to the British Society for Immunology, the virus hijacks the cell and commandeers the structures inside the cell to make more copies of itself. The infected cell's ribosomes are directed to create viral RNA and proteins.""After that, the cell's Golgi apparatus puts the proteins and RNA together and coats them in protein, which creates new copies of the coronavirus.""The biochemical distress of being hijacked by the virus eventually kills the cell, which causes damage to the infected tissue.""At the same time, the body tries to fight off the infection by sending killer T-cells. The killer cells search and destroy compromised cells. The immune system's attack on the infected part of the body leads to more tissue damage and inflammation.""Speaking to the Guardian, John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician, said the coronavirus infection spreads down the respiratory system and may reach the alveoli at the bottom of the lungs. This fills the lungs with liquids and inflammatory materials.""Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, breathing difficulties and muscle pains. Citing doctors, the New York Times reports the virus may move in the blood to attack the heart, the kidneys, and the liver. Lung damage would also deprive patients of blood oxygen.""George Washington University Hospital reports that 20 percent of COVID-19 patients are symptomatic. A portion of these develop severe symptoms and become unable to breath without using ventilators or other medical devices."SOURCES: Journal of American Medical Association, Frontiers in Medicinehttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852?appId=scwebhttp://journal.hep.com.cn/fmd/EN/10.1007/s11684-020-0754-0https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/pathogens-and-disease/virus-replicationhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/what-happens-to-peoples-lungs-when-they-get-coronavirus***]]></description>

The report, issued on April 1, buttresses the argument that asymptomatic people should wear masks to reduce inadvertent transmission of the virus. In an email to Science Insider, Kimberly Prather, an aerosol chemist at the University of California, San Diego, said she was "relieved to see aerosolization is accepted.""This added airborne pathway helps explain why it is spreading so fast," she said.As late as March 27, a scientific brief from the World Health Organization stated that an analysis of more than 75,000 COVID-19 cases in China found no cases of the virus spreading through aerosols. On April 3, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its previous advice on wearing masks in public, and recommended that everyone wear cloth face coverings while out in public during the pandemic.In its announcement, the CDC stressed that surgical masks or N-95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

These fall to the ground within 1 or 2 meters. They can also be deposited on surfaces, from where they can infect people who touch their eyes, nose or mouth.""The report by the National Academies cited previous research, including a study in the New England Journal of Medicine which found that novel coronavirus can float in aerosol droplets less than 5 microns wide for up to three hours. That study cited an earlier one from University of Nebraska Medical Center researchers which found viral RNA on hard-to-reach surfaces and in air samples more than 2 meters away from infected people.""The report also cited research from Wuhan University which found that novel coronavirus can be resuspended in the air when healthcare workers remove their personal protective equipment, clean infected floors, or otherwise operate in infected areas.""Also cited in the National Academies report was a study by University of Hong Kong researchers in Nature Medicine, which found masks reduced the detection of human coronavirus RNA  not including SARS-CoV-2  in both respiratory droplets and aerosols.

As springtails are attracted to the substance, they follow the scent and eat the bacteria.By encouraging springtails to eat them, streptomyces get their spores on the arthropods and in their feces, which allows the bacteria to spread and reproduce. This mutually beneficial relationship may have endured for 450 million years.Streptomyces produce antibiotics that kill nematodes and fruit flies, but not springtails. According to the scientists, this is evidence that springtails have evolved to privilege the bacteria as a food source, which the springtails help to spread.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

As springtails are attracted to the substance, they follow the scent and eat the bacteria.""By encouraging springtails to eat them, streptomyces get their spores on the arthropods and in their feces, which allows the bacteria to spread and reproduce." "This mutually beneficial relationship may have endured for 450 million years.""Streptomyces produce antibiotics that kill nematodes and fruit flies, but not springtails.""According to the scientists, this is evidence that springtails have evolved to privilege the bacteria as a food source, which the springtails help to spread."SOURCES: Nature Microbiology, John Innes Centrehttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0697-xhttps://www.jic.ac.uk/press-release/research-unearths-the-science-behind-the-smell-of-spring/***]]></description>

The base camp will provide a fixed outpost for exploration and in the long term would include a landing pad and infrastructure for power, radiation shielding, and waste disposal and storage.Core elements for a sustained presence on the Moon would include a lunar terrain vehicle, for mobility around the base camp, a habitable mobility platform that would allow for longer excursions on the Moon for up to 45 days, and a fixed lunar foundation surface habitat that could house as many as four astronauts for shorter periods of time.NASA's planned Gateway outpost in lunar orbit would serve as a command and control center for operations on the Moon's surface, a rendez-vous point for spacecraft traveling to and from Earth, as well as provide living quarters and space to conduct scientific research.In an April 3 article on its website, NASA said it envisions sending four astronauts to the Gateway for a multi-month stay to simulate a trip to Mars. Later, two crew members would travel to the lunar surface and explore with the habitable mobility platform.The four astronauts would then be reunited aboard the Gateway for another multi-month stay to simulate the return trip to Earth.NASA said: "These missions will be by far the longest duration human deep-space missions in history."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Like the Apollo program's Lunar Roving Vehicle, the LTV will be an unenclosed rover. Astronauts driving it will wear spacesuits that have been specifically designed for the Artemis program.""For exploration beyond the lunar base camp, astronauts will use a habitable mobility platform, a larger pressurized rover with living space and amenities for trips across the Moon lasting up to 45 days.""The habitable mobility platform will be the primary residence for surface missions, but a lunar foundation surface habitat at the base camp will provide a more permanent habitat for as many as four crew members on shorter surface stays."SOURCES: NASAhttps://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-outlines-lunar-surface-sustainability-concepthttps://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/a_sustained_lunar_presence_nspc_report4220final.pdf***]]></description>

The researchers identified host-derived sugars  or glycans  embedded in the envelope of the spike protein, as well as the concentration of the sugars in each location on the spike.Glycans are what viruses use for hiding from the immune system and sneaking into human cells.Writing in a news release, the researchers say SARS-CoV-2's embedded glycan defenses are thinner than those of many other viruses.This suggests the coronavirus is a "hit and run" virus that moves rapidly from one person to another.Paper co-author Max Crispin is cited as saying the study about the coronavirus's sugars is "a very encouraging message for vaccine development," and the research team is already working with partners who have designed candidate vaccines.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Scientists made the discovery while analyzing old data from Kepler. They found that previous searches with a computer algorithm had misidentified Kepler-1649c as a false positive. "Out of all the mislabeled planets we've recovered, this one's particularly exciting," said Andrew Vanderburg, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of the paper published on April 15 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. "If we hadn't looked over the algorithm's work by hand, we would have missed it.""In terms of size and likely temperature, this is the most similar planet to Earth that has ever been found with Kepler," said co-author Jeff Coughlin at the SETI Institute. "It's incredible to me that we just found it now, seven years after data collection stopped on the original Kepler field."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of Kepler-1649c and size comparison with Earth2. Kepler-1649 orbits the red dwarf Kepler-1649 from which it receives 75 percent of the amount of light Earth receives from the Sun3. Kepler-1649c's orbital period and location within its star's habitable zone4. Depiction of the orbits of Kepler-1649c and Kepler-1649b along with a speculated third planetVOICEOVER (in English): "Among all the exoplanets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft thus far, Kepler-1649c is most similar to Earth in size and estimated surface temperature." "The planet is just 1.06 times the size of Earth and it may share similar surface temperatures since it receives 75 percent of the amount of light Earth receives from the Sun, though it orbits a red dwarf star, which may be prone to frequent flare-ups.""Kepler-1649c orbits the red dwarf so closely that a year on Kepler-1649c lasts only 19.5 Earth days. But it lies within the star's Goldilocks Zone, where temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the planet.""Kepler-1649c has a neighboring planet, Kepler-1649b. Kepler-1649c circles the red dwarf nine times for every four times the inner planet orbits. This nine-to-four ratio is rare, and may indicate the presence of another planet, which scientists have not observed because it may be too small or have an orbital tilt that makes it hard to find."SOURCES: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, SETI Institute, The Astrophysical Journal Letters, NASA Exoplanet Archivehttps://www.nasa.gov/press-release/earth-size-habitable-zone-planet-found-hidden-in-early-nasa-kepler-datahttps://www.seti.org/press-release/dedicated-team-scientists-discover-habitable-zone-earth-size-planet-kepler-datahttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab84e5https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/intro.html***]]></description>

This pocket of ionized gas, a plasma structure called plasmoid, was 400 km across and 200 km long.According to NASA's news release, Uranus is special in that it spins almost on its side "like a pig on a spit roast," while the axis of its magnetic field is offset from the spin by 60 degrees. This gives the planet's magnetic field an odd wobble that scientists cannot model.As solar winds blasted Uranus, the bombardment pinched gas off from the far end of the field. The resulting leak was then accidentally discovered by NASA researchers who were reviewing the old magnetic data.In the new research, scientists dialed up the reading's resolution to make a data point every two seconds.

"The modified viruses should make the human cells produce the same spike proteins that stud the surface of the coronaviruses and teach the immune system to recognize COVID-19.""When vaccine recipients actually encounter the coronavirus, their bodies' immune system would then be able to identify the threat and scramble antibodies and killer T cells to fight off the infection.""At the time of report, two volunteers have received the shot, out of around 800 recruited for the first phase human trial.""Citing the doctors, the BBC reports potential side effects include headache, fever and muscle pains a couple of days after the injection."SOURCES: BBChttps://www.bbc.com/news/health-52394485***]]></description>

When humidity was raised to 80 percent, the halflife fell to six hours. When sunlight was added, the half-life dropped to just two minutes. When the virus was aerosolized in droplets that hang in the air, its half-life was one hour when the temperature was 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) with 20 percent humidity. When sunlight was added to the equation, its half-life was only one-and-a-half minutes. The new research was announced to reporters at the White House by William Bryan, science and technology advisor to the Department of Homeland Security secretary.The study, which was carried out by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Maryland, has not yet been released for review and is still awaiting external evaluation.Bryan's summary of the research leaves many questions unanswered, such as the intensity and wavelength of the ultraviolet light used in the experiment.In a statement sent to CNN, the Illuminating Engineering Society, a non-profit industry group, said, "Ultraviolet disinfecting 'wands' or other ultraviolet products for residential use  as they are inadequately proven and unregulated  may pose a safety hazard and are unlikely to provide the protection expected."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
