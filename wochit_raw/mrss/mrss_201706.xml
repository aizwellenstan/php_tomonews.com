      <title>Japan&#x2019;s JS Izumo to guard U.S. navy ship for the first time</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  Japan’s aircraft carrier-like destroyer left Yokosuka Naval Base on Monday to escort a U.S. supply vessel. This deployment is a first for Japan’s navy as previous Japanese laws forbade such action.Japan’s largest warship, the JS Izumo is 814 feet long and weighs 27,000 tons when fully loaded. It is shorter than China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and USS George H.W. Bush.The JS Izumo is armed with three Phalanx CIWS point defense guns and two SeaRAM last-ditch interceptor missiles. It normally carries seven SH-60J anti-submarine warfare helicopters.For decades, Japan’s constitution forbade the country’s Self Defense Forces from rendering aid to allies. However, the country enacted new security legislation last March that expanded the scope of Self-Defense Forces’ overseas missions.]]></description>
