Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the city would be accepting proposals to build an express service from the airport to downtown last Wednesday, according to Newsweek.  Soon after Musk tweeted, "The Boring Company will compete to fund, build and operate a high-speed Loop connecting Chicago O'Hare Airport to downtown." The loop would be a system of tunnels underneath the city that would use electric pods rather than a vacuum tube like the hyperloop concept. The proposed route would be less than 20 miles and would need to take less than 20 minutes, according to Mayor Emanuel. The Boring Company will need  to present plans on design, finance, construction, operation and maintenance of the Loop system. No taxpayer funding will be made available for the transit project.

The system is called the CHAMP, which stands for Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project. It's a high-powered microwave weapon that can be delivered on an air-launched cruise missile from an American bomber, according to CNN. The Champ system is designed to fly at low altitudes into enemy airspace and send out strong electromagnetic impulses in order to jam enemy control-and-command systems. Cruise missiles fired by the enemy would then splash down in the ocean. The system is still in the development phase and also has drawbacks. Although non-lethal, the missile looks similar to the nuclear-capable variant and could be mistaken as an act of war if spotted by other countries. Another obstacle for the CHAMP system is that military equipment often has redundant wiring and insulation to protect from electronic attacks. The system would need to be able to disable all those electronics in order to successfully bring missiles down out of the sky. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. CHAMP missile sending out electromagnetic impulses2.

The energy produced would have zero carbon emissions, and could potentially be done at low cost if the production scale is large enough.The reactor will have to be able to sustain temperatures 150 million degrees celsius  10 times hotter than the sun's core. The massive donut-shaped tokamak reactor will be surrounded by giant magnets that take superheated plasma away from the metal walls of the container. This requires the magnets to be cooled to -269 degrees celsius. The next milestone for the project will be to get to "first plasma" by December 2025 in order to prove the concept is viable.

As such, it's one of the most tightly controlled parts of China.According to Human Rights Watch, authorities in Xinjiang are now collecting DNA samples and biometric data from all residents aged 12 to 65.Police officers collect photos, fingerprints, household registration data, and iris scans during home visits or at designated collection points.Blood types and DNA are gathered through a government health exam called "Physicals for All". Data is transmitted to a database and linked to the individual's national ID number.People originally from Xinjiang who have moved to other parts of China are also required to submit their information locally.Over 18 million people have participated in the physical as of November 2017.

Research institutions Inria and the French National Center for Scientific Research are designing the drone to squeeze through a 1.5-inch hole, before unfolding and inflating, Digital Trends reported. "The main challenge is to insert a complete exploration robot in a hole that is as small as possible," Inria researcher Dr. Jean-Baptiste Mouret told Digital Trends. "It's important to use a hole as small as possible because we want to leave as few traces as we can. This is what we call 'minimally invasive robotics.' We chose a diameter of 1.5 inches because it is a good trade-off between the size of the hole, the kind of machines that can bore holes, and the current robotic technologies."The blimp model was chosen over conventional multi-rotor drones because it's safer the surrounding environment during exploration. The blimp drone can make contact with obstacles without damaging the monument. They are also more stable than multi-rotor drones, which is important for taking photos in low-light conditions. The camera equipped drone will be remotely operated by radio, however can also operate autonomously via small onboard sensors. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The blimp drone being inserted into a chamber2.

Passengers' faces are scanned at the boarding gate, and matched to a DHS database for verification.Face scans are mandatory for foreign nationals, but U.S. citizens on international flights can opt out and have their documents manually checked.It's unclear though, if American passengers are being informed of this option.According to Homeland Security's own data, 1 in 25 travelers are erroneously rejected by the system despite using valid credentials.The technology also reportedly had high error rates, and often inaccurately identified women and African Americans.

Researchers at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development are working on a hormonal gel that reduces sperm count when applied to the skin. The gel contains two synthetic hormones  nestorone and testosterone. The nestorone blocks the testes from making enough testosterone to produce normal levels of sperm. The synthetic testosterone is needed to prevent hormonal imbalance caused by the nestorone.More than 400 couples in the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Sweden, Chile and Kenya will participate in the clinical trial. Couples will use the treatment for over four months while their sperm levels are checked.  Men in the study will take home a bottle of the gel and rub around half a teaspoon of it on their upper arms or shoulders every day. The gel takes about a minute to dry. According to researchers, the gel can lower sperm count for about 72 hours.      RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The topical gel is made from synthetic nestorone and testosterone2.

On August 21, researchers from MIT's Haystack Observatory and the University of Troms in Norway were able to find "the first unambiguous evidence" of atmospheric bow-waves.  The team published their findings in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The bow-wave theory says that a total solar eclipse will create high-pressure pockets under the moon's shadow that then slice through low-pressure air as the path of totality moves across the planet. These air pockets then generate small bow waves in the atmosphere.During the August eclipse, the scientists collected data from around 2,000 satellite sensors placed across North America. They detected tiny bow waves in Earth's ionosphere, the section of the atmosphere that begins 37 miles above the surface. The researchers said their study, "reveals complex interconnections between the Sun, Moon and Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere."   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Solar eclipse2.

It causes flu-like symptoms, and can kill 80% of those exposed within 24 hours, unless antibiotics are administered.South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bought 1,000 doses of anthrax vaccine for agents or civilians. The Blue House  South Korea's executive office  has an additional 350, ordered by the previous government.Fears of a biochemical attack come just weeks before the South is set to host the 2018 Winter Olympics.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
