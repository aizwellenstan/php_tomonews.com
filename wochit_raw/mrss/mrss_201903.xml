Researchers believe it's possible to develop electronic systems that can wrap around highways, bridges, or office walls.Though the technology has been around for a while, most rectennas are made from rigid materials like silicon or gallium arsenide, according to Science Alert. The MIT team is the first to create a flexible rectenna that can generate a practical amount of electricity.The team's research was published Monday in the journal Nature. They are now reportedly planning to improve efficiency and build more complex systems.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. 2D rectenna made with molybdenum disulfide converts wifi signals into direct current2.

Symptoms include high fever, redness on the ears, abdomen and legs, and diarrhea. In serious cases, it can cause death within 6 to 13 days.The Guardian reports that Denmark's electrified fence will be 1.5 meter tall, and at least 50 centimeters deep to stop boar from burrowing under.According to the BBC, there will be 20 gaps at border crossings and waterways, one gate every kilometer with steps elsewhere for humans, and 20-centimeter openings every 100 meters for small animals.Though African swine fever has not yet been seen in Denmark, the country has over 12 million pigs across 3,000 farms, and pork exports are worth billions of dollars annually.Critics say the fence is not a practical solution, citing gaps at roads due to the E.U.'s open border scheme, and to wild boar populations that can swim across bodies of water.In Germany, the effectiveness of such a structure is also being questioned, since research has shown that the biggest risk of spreading the disease is through contaminated equipment and food.The Danish government is reportedly spending $12 million on the fence, which is expected to be completed later this year.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Combined, the two groups have stolen roughly $1 billion in cryptocurrency. According to Bitcoin.com, digital surveillance company Chainalysis identified two groups behind many of the hacks in the field in its latest "crypto crime" report.Analysts say on average, each hack from either of the two groups involved around $90 million per incident. Chainalysis says the first hacking group is a "giant, tightly controlled organization" that could be driven in part by non-monetary goals. The second group is smaller, less organized and more brazen, but primarily focused on money. According to the report, at least 50 percent of stolen cryptocurrency were converted into hard currency through some type of conversion service within 112 days of the hacks. Chainalysis said 64.3 percent of the funds were sent to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, 11.9 percent to peer-to-peer exchanges and the other 23.8 percent used conversion services such as mixing services, bitcoin ATMs and gambling sites. The report found, "exchanges are regularly processing the stolen funds, allowing the hackers to convert the funds to traditional currencies or other cryptocurrencies." This is due to the fact that the stolen funds look like they are coming from the legitimate owners to the exchanges not hacked. It can also be difficult for exchanges to tell if cryptocurrency has been stolen without having specialized investigation software. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Two hacker groups stealing crypto from exchanges2.

Burn victims, those with prosthetic limbs and others who have lost skin sensitivity can often hurt themselves on accident. According to UConn Today, researchers from the University of Connecticut and University of Toronto wanted to create a sensor that could mimic the sensing abilities of the skin, as well as the ability to detect magnetic fields and sound waves. The scientists made a sensor with a silicone tube wrapped in a copper wire and filled with a solution of iron oxide nanoparticles.An electric current is created when the nanoparticles rub the inside of the silicone tube, which is picked up as a signal from the copper wire. Researchers were able to distinguish between pressure, sound waves and magnetic fields. They were also able to tell the differences between electrical signals caused by walking, running, jumping and swimming. The team hope the sensors will someday be able to help burn victims "feel" again or be used as an early warning system for workers exposed to high magnetic fields. The scientists will now work to see if they can make a functional sensor into a flat configuration more like skin. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Sensor can detect touch, magnetic fields and sound waves2.

It currently takes 21 hours and 7 ferry crossing to travel between these two cities, according to NPR.The new Coastal Highway Route would include bridges as well as submerged floating tunnels that would connect different fjords, CNN reports. It is expected to cut travel time by half.The floating tunnels would be installed around 30 meters under the water, according to CNN.The tunnels would be anchored to the seabed or to pontoons which would float on the surface of the water, CNN reports. This will help in stabilizing the structure. It will then function as an ordinary tunnel, allowing vehicles to drive from one end to the other.If Norway succeeds, this could be the world's first underwater floating tunnel.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Sonars may be causing some whales to become suicidal</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA new report suggests that whale's suicidal behavior may be linked to sonar waves. Sonar waves cause major distress for underwater mammals. They are thought to scare them away, but a new report suggests that the effects are deadly.The report suggests suicidal behavior in some beaked whales is linked to exposure to sonar waves. Cuvier's beaked whales are deep divers with bodies capable of withstanding changing pressure. Their metabolism slows down to save oxygen and their organs adapt to avoid decompression sickness.However, according to a report published in the Royal Society Proceedings B Journal, when the whales come into contact with sonar waves emitted by naval patrols, they quickly swim away in fear and confusion. Nitrogen gas bubbles then accumulate in the whales' veins, causing brain hemorrhages and damage to their organs and nervous system, including their spinal cord. This unnatural, quick change in their diving pattern makes the animal accumulate nitrogen.Beaked whales normally dive over 1,000 meters deep for one hour, but when exposed to sonar waves they swim for over two hours at depths of around 3,000 meters.Once disoriented and hurt they tend to beach in nearby coasts. In 2003 a paper pointing out the possible link between sonar and whale deaths led to a 2004 ban on naval exercises around the Canary Islands.Scientists behind the report have an idea for a solution. They suggest placing more moratoriums on mid-frequency sonar activity in regions where large groups of beached whales frequently appear.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cuvier's beaked whales swimming in the ocean2.

The rover will be exploring the mountain's "clay-bearing unit" at the south of the Vera Rubin Ridge. The mission team believes the minerals in this area will help them understand lake formations that contributed to the shape of the lower levels of Mount Sharp.As of December 2018, the Curiosity Rover has drilled and collected nineteen samples of Martian sediments. The latest sample was collected in an area of the Vera Rubin Ridge called Rock Hall.Curiosity first landed on Mars in August 2012 and has since been snapping selfies and collecting data to complete its main mission: finding out if Mars could host microbial life and determine whether or not there ever were forms of life on the Red Planet.New Atlas reports NASA's second rover on the Red Planet, Opportunity, lost contact with its team after a global sand storm blocked out the sun for several days in May 2018.

The goal of the digital program called ONE System is to collect and sort information in order to tailor housing needs, rehabilitation and other services in order to cut down on costly, wasteful duplication efforts. According to Bloomberg, the $5 million 50-employee pilot program began in August.According to the San Francisco Chronicle, by typing in a homeless person's name, information about every health, housing, jail and counseling program that person has ever been involved in will come up instantly. ONE System was designed by Nevada startup BitFocus Inc., and collects data from 15 city and state agencies, according to Bloomberg.  Participants are asked 17 questions that help determine their individual situation, including time spent on the street, health and vulnerability. The program has so far signed up around 1,000 people, with the goal of registering 2,000 by the end of October. The city's homeless count currently sits at 7,499, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANChina has developed an anti-corruption AI system called "Zero Trust" to help identify corrupt public officials. According to the SCMP, it was developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Communist Party's internal control institutions to monitor, evaluate or intervene in the work and personal life of public servants. Zero Trust can cross-reference more than 150 protected databases in central and local governments systems, reports the SCMP. The system is designed to detect property transfers, infrastructure construction, land purchases and house demolitions, according to one researcher involved with the program, according the SCMP. Researchers built the system to detect unusual increases in bank savings, new car purchases or bidding for government contracts under the name of the official or one of his or her family or friends.The system then calculates a probability for those actions to be corrupt and if authorities need to be alerted. According to the SCMP, Zero Trust was only rolled out in 30 counties and cities, but managed to catch 8,721 government officials engaging in embezzlement, abuse of power, misuse of government funds and nepotism. Only some were sentence to jail time, however most were allowed to keep their jobs after receiving a warning or minor punishment. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

There are six types: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom.Up and down quarks, which are the most common, and group together to form protons and neutrons. The quarks have fractional charges, which add up to become the positive proton and neutral neutron charges.Charm and strange have a fleeting existence according to Symmetry Magazine, as they're unstable particles that easily decay into conventional particles.The six quarks differ in size and weight, with up and down quarks being the lightest, followed by charm and strange, and then bottom quarks. Top quarks are the largest - about 100 trillion times heavier than up quarks.This wide range in masses is believed to be due to the Higgs field. According to CERN, particles acquire a mass by interacting with this invisible field, whose visible manifestation is the Higgs boson particle. The more a particle interacts, the heavier it is.Experiments at the Large Hadron Collider reveal that the Higgs boson interacts strongly with the top quark.Physicists believe that by studying its coupling with top quarks, more can be learned about the properties of the Higgs boson.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers have identified a specific blood-clotting protein that can trigger synaptic damage after leaking into the brain, according to New Atlas. A new study published in the journal Neuron finds the protein fibrinogen can be found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease and experimental lab mice. According to New Atlas, scientists found that when fibrinogen enters the brain through blood-brain barrier leaks, it triggers inflammation that can damage neuron synapses. The team found that fibrinogen can cause synaptic damage in the absence of any amyloid plaque build-up. Other studies have proposed that an increasingly permeable blood-brain barrier may allow more toxic amyloid and tau proteins to enter the brain, starting the pathological process that leads to Alzheimer's. This new study could provide an alternative explanation. While tests on animals have been conducted, the findings have yet to lead to human clinical trials. According to the researchers, the type of synaptic damage associated with blood-brain barrier breakdowns could play a role in various neurological conditions. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA new study of two large groups of Europeans has found several types of gut bacteria are missing in people with depression, according to Science Magazine. The scientists could not say whether the absence is a cause or an effect of the illness, but were able to show that many gut bacteria could produce substances that affect nerve cell function and possibly mood. The results were published in the journal Nature Microbiology. To test the link between the microbiome and depression, Jeroen Raes, a microbiologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, and his team looked at 1054 Belgians to assess a "normal" microbiome. Within the group, 173 people had been diagnosed with depression or done poorly on a quality of life survey. The gut microbes of depressed group was then compared to the "normal" group. Two types of bacteria, Coprococcus and Dialister, were absent from the guts of depressed participants. The team then looked at the microbiomes of 1064 Dutch participants and also found the same two species were missing in people who were depressed. It is still unclear how the gut microbiome affects the brain. One possible avenue is through the vagus nerve, which connects the gut and the brain. But with more studies, scientists hope the microbiome-brain connection could eventually lead to novel therapies for treating depression.    RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It's expected to be the centerpiece of the British Navy once it enters service in 2020.British and American F-35 fighter jets will reportedly be embedded in the air wing of the carrier, which Williamson says will enhance "the reach and lethality of our forces" while reinforcing the U.S. as a close partner.Williamson's speech came on the same day the U.S. sailed two Navy warships near the Mischief Reef in the Spratlys to challenge Beijing's territorial claims.This prompted Chinese foreign ministry to issue a sharp rebuke telling the U.S. to stop "provocative actions" that violate China's sovereignty.The South China Morning Post reports that Britain has repeatedly stated intentions to increase activity abroad, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to build a military base in either Singapore or Brunei.During his recent speech, Williamson also mentioned a plan to develop a squadron of network-enabled drones that can confuse and overwhelm enemy air defences.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Vox, Trump could also unlock a $20 million immigration emergency fund that's meant to be used by states to feed and house migrants.CNN reports that if the emergency declaration is made, the Army Corps of Engineers would then be deployed to build the wall.Private property on which some portions of the wall will be built can be seized by the administration since it will be for public use. Internal White House documents reviewed by CNN indicates that "environmental reviews can be skipped, and Homeland Security can use waivers to bypass contracting laws."Congress can override the declaration with a simple majority vote, but if the President were to veto, they will need a supermajority or two-thirds vote in both chambers to override it.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Sleep helps reduce inflammation and fight atherosclerosis in mice</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA new study published in the journal Nature has found that getting adequate sleep can help by reducing inflammation in the body and fighting against atherosclerosis. According to Live Science, the study found that fragmented sleep in mice affects levels of a certain hormone, which then increases production of inflammatory cells in the bone marrow. This inflammation plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaques made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances build up inside arteries.  The new study looked at mice that were genetically prone to atherosclerosis. Some of the mice were allowed to get adequate sleep, while another group's sleep was frequently interrupted by a "sweep bar" that automatically swept across the bottom of the cage. The scientists found the sleep-deprived mice had larger arterial plaques and higher levels of inflammation in their blood vessels compared with the sleep-sufficient mice. Researchers also discovered sleep-deprived mice had lower levels of the hormone hypocretin, which led to an increase in the levels of the signalling protein CSF1. This in turn increased production of inflammatory white blood cells in the bone marrow and accelerated atherosclerosis. The team found that by restoring hypocretin levels in the mice reduced atherosclerosis. According to study senior author Filip Swirski, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Systems Biology, "we have discovered that sleep helps regulate the production… of inflammatory cells and the health of blood vessels and that, conversely, sleep disruption breaks down control of inflammatory cell production, leading to more inflammation and heart disease."  The next step will be for researchers to see if the results can be replicated in humans.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. New study findings2. Mice split into sufficient sleep and sleep-deprived groups3.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers have discovered what may be another massive crater below Greenland's ice sheets, NASA announced on Monday. According to Space.com, the suspected crater is around 22 miles or 36 kilometers wide, but has not been definitively identified yet as an impact crater. According the NBC News, this comes just months after other scientists discovered a 19-mile-wide impact crater under the Hiawatha glacier. Joe MacGregor, a glaciologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, is a co-author of the paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, which describes the find. He was also on the team that found the Hiawatha crater.  After the finding the Hiawatha crater, MacGregor and his team analyzed topographic maps and satellite imagery to see if there might be other craters in the area. That's when they discovered the second bowl-shaped feature 114 miles southeast of the Hiawatha crater. According to NBC, the presence was confirmed using Operation IceBridge data, an ongoing NASA mission which uses planes to map changes in ice in the polar regions. In order for researchers to determine if this second structure is actually an impact crater, scientists will need to conduct more field work or obtain core samples to confirm the discovery. According to NBC, the team says they are unsure how old the structure is, but they estimated it was formed 100,000 to 100 million years ago.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party needed their support to expel Rajoy as they only hold 84 of the 350 seats in Congress.According to The New York Times, this time around Catalan pro-independence parties rejected Sanchez's government budget plan and sided with the People's Party and the center-right Citizen's party. The budget was rejected 191 to 158 with one abstention.The shift in alliance comes after Catalan pro-independence parties made it clear that support for the budget would only come if independence talks were held. However, Sanchez's government sustains that, according to Spain's constitution, the country must remain united. Spain is divided into 17 autonomous regions. Catalonia is one of the wealthiest of them. According to CNBC, it accounts for roughly 20 percent of the country's GDP.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Workers then remotely operated the probe from a building close to the No. 2 reactor building.The probe lifted pebble-like nuclear fuel debris at five spots and failed to pick up debris in one area. The probe also touched melted fuel on the workers scaffold below the reactor's pressure vessel. The retrieval process will start in earnest at one of the reactors in 2021, according to a joint central government and TEPCO plan.

It is one of the planet's seven inner moons, and the newest of its 14 known moons.Naming conventions for the Neptune system require something out of Greco-Roman undersea mythology. In Greek mythology, Hippocamp is a half fish, half horse creature. It's related to Hippocampus, which is the scientific name for the seahorse, and the name of a major component of the human brain that's seahorse-shaped.Hippocamp measures about 34 kilometers across, and is 1/1000th the mass of Proteus, which at 418 kilometers across is Neptune's largest inner satellite.The small moon was observed to be orbiting unusually close to Proteus, even though such a large moon should have gravitationally swept it aside and cleared its orbital path.In a paper published in the journal Nature, SETI researchers hypothesized that Hippocamp is a fragment of Proteus that broke off following a collision with a comet billions of years ago.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the New York Times, China is trying to force the country's predominantly Muslim Uighurs to become more subservient to the party. The government has detained up to a million people in "re-education" camps. According to Fortune, part of the surveillance effort is to collect biometric data such as iris scans, fingerprints, voice scans, and DNA.  According to the New York Times, human right groups and Uighur activists say a comprehensive DNA database could be used to chase down Uighurs who resist conforming to the campaign. To improve their DNA tracking and testing capabilities, China's police purchased genetic sequencing equipment from Massachusetts biotechnology firm Thermo Fisher Scientific. Chinese authorities also used genetic material from people around the world that was provided by prominent Yale University geneticist, Kenneth Kidd, to compare to Uighur DNA. According to the New York Times, on Wednesday, Thermo Fisher said it would no longer sell its equipment in Xinjiang. According to Dr. Kidd, he was unaware how his material and expertise were being used. He said he thought Chinese scientists were acting within scientific norms that require informed consent by DNA donors.

According to the Associated Press, American, United and Singapore all said last Friday that they have never activated the cameras and have no plans to use them. According to an American Airlines spokesman, entertainment system companies have been installing the cameras to offer future options like seat-to-seat conferencing.  American's seat-back entertainment systems are manufactured by Panasonic, while Singapore uses Panasonic and Thales, according to airline representatives. American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said cameras are in premium economy seats on 82 Boeing 777 and Airbus A330-200 planes. Singapore spokesman James Boyd said cameras are on 84 Airbus A350s, Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s and 787s. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

He Jiankui said he altered the babies' DNA to remove a gene called CCR5, according to a Associated Press report from the time. This would make the twin baby girls immune to HIV. New research, published in the journal Cell, people who lack CCR5 were found to have better cognition and were also found to recover faster from strokes. The researchers tested their theory on mice. They altered the DNA of the mice to remove CCR5. This was found to enhance animals' intelligence.According to MIT Technology Review, the scientists connected their findings to the Chinese twins. Researcher Alconi J.Silva explained the gene-modification performed on them "likely" affected their brains. "The simplest interpretation is that those mutations will probably have an impact on cognitive function in the twins," Silva explained, according to MIT Technology Review.Follow up studies about CCR5 are already taking place at UCLA, with participants being given Maraviroc, an HIV treatment , to see if it improves cognition.  Silva said that altering CCR5 was found to have big effects. Silva added that we "are not ready" for the consequences we could potentially face for mutating DNA.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the study, stratocumulus clouds cover 20 percent of tropical oceans and critically affect Earth's energy balance by reflecting 30-60 percent of shortwave radiation back into space. Researchers from the California Institute of Technology ran detailed simulations of cloud formation and the effects solar radiation had on them. Their results were published in the journal Nature. Scientists modeled a small patch of sky using a supercomputer to run simulations, and found that if carbon dioxide levels reach about 1,200 parts per million, or ppm, in the atmosphere, stratocumulus clouds break up.Currently, atmospheric carbon dioxide is around 410 ppm, however if the current trend of releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere continues at this pace, the Earth could reach 1,200 ppm in 100 to 150 years.  The resulting loss of stratocumulus clouds could lead to an increase in temperature of 14 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius).

Images taken by NASA show a northward expanding crevice, named Chasm 1 by the British Antarctic Survey, stretching across the Antarctic Brunt Ice Shelf and a smaller crevice called Halloween crack, inching closer to the edge of the ice shelf. The two cracks are just 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles from each other. When these two rifts meet, an iceberg twice the size of New York City will break off of the shelf. NASA predicts the resulting mass of the iceberg could cover 1,700 kilometers or 660 square miles. This would make it the largest iceberg to break away from the Brunt Ice Shelf in over a century.According to the Natural Environment Research Council, this phenomenon is called iceberg calving. Calving occurs when large portions of ice break off from glaciers or the margins of ice shelves.Data from the Natural Environment Research Council show that these shifts have forced British researchers working at the Halley Research Station to relocate.

The debates will be held in June and July on two separate consecutive nights depending on the number of candidates that qualify.The Associated Press reports that candidates will qualify for the debate if they earn at least 1 percent support in three separate national or early primary state polls conducted from January 1 to two weeks before the debate.They can also qualify if they receive campaign donations from 65,000 people across 20 different states, with a minimum of 200 unique donors per state.Candidates will be assigned randomly to the two stages regardless of each candidates polling percentages.Efforts for a fairer and less poll-driven selection process for the nominees comes after voters in the 2016 elections felt the DNC was biased against the then outsider Senator Bernie Sanders.These claims stemmed mainly from allegations by former DNC chair Donna Brazile. In her book 'Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House' Brazile accuses Hillary Clinton of rigging the primary elections in her favor by signing a joint fundraising agreement with the DNC and the Hillary Victory Fund.The exact dates and locations for the debates are yet to be confirmed, however, the DNC announced that NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo will broadcast the June debates on back-to-back nights, and CNN will broadcast the July debate on back-to-back nights.
