His mummified body was discovered near the Italy-Austria border in 1991.According to Science News, he was believed to have died due to freezing temperatures in the Italian Alps. But the discovery of an arrowhead in his left shoulder has led scientists to believe he was deliberately killed.A new study from the University of Glasgow examined fragments of frozen vegetation buried alongside or inside Otzi, which includes 75 different species of mosses and liverworts.Only 30% of the species are local, others were likely transported via Otzi's clothing or inside his gut.According to New Scientist, researchers found a type of bog moss in Otzi's colon that is used to staunch wounds, and may have been used to treat a gash on his palm.His intestines also contained the moss Neckera complanata and traces of pollen.Both moss species are found in low-elevation woodlands, while Otzi was found 3,200 meters above sea level.This suggests the Iceman travelled from the forests below and went through Schnalstal valley on his final ascent.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The researchers say that 21 women volunteers were subjected to three full body exposures to UV rays over one week.Blood samples were tested for vitamin D levels and stool samples were tested for the biodiversity of their gut bacteria.Frontiers Science News reports that half of the participants who regularly took vitamin D supplements experienced no changes to their gut microbiome.However, women who did not take supplements saw increases to vitamin D levels, and their gut microbiome became as diverse as the supplemented group.The researchers state that multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with the lack of sunlight, vitamin D, and unhealthy gut microbiota.The study indicates that there is a direct link between those factors, but it does not identify the causal mechanism.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

"Measles resets the immune system to an immature, baby-like state, with only a narrow range of antibodies to work with, and a limited ability to fight off new infections."A way to avoid this is by getting the MMR vaccine, which eliminates the risk of catching a measles infection.

African swine fever is spread through bites by infectious ticks, contact through infected animals, contact with objects containing the virus, or by ingesting the meat of infected animals. The disease is spread by the DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family.Symptoms of the disease include high fever, redness on the ears, abdomen, legs as well as diarrhea.The disease can be fatal for pigs, though it isn't transmissible to humans.There is currently no approved vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the World Organization for Animal Health.The swine fever outbreak has already claimed as many as 100 million pigs in China, the Guardian reports.

Now, scientists have developed next-generation sequencing technology to allow them to build a complete genome sequence from the third HIV sample.After analyzing the HIV virus, the researchers have identified it as the HIV-1 Group M subtype L.In the news release, one of the authors of the study, Mary Rodgers, principal scientist at Abbott Laboratories, said that identifying new viruses is like "searching for a needle in a haystack."Rodgers added that the new sequencing technology was like a "magnet" that allowed them to find the needle.According to CNN, current HIV treatments are able to fight different types of virus strains. It is believed to be able to fight this newly identified HIV strain as well.The study concluded by saying that additional strains of HIV could be spreading around in the Democratic Republic of Congo or elsewhere.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

These contain large amounts of plankton for larval fish that live in the surface slicks.The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found seven times more plastic present in the surface slicks than larval fish.Researchers also found that plastics were 126 times more concentrated in the slicks than surface water off the coast of the same island.Scientists involved in the study dissected hundreds of larval fish from the surface slicks and found that pelagic fish species, including swordfish and mahi-mahi, and larval fish, such as triggerfish, all contained tiny pieces of plastic in their stomachs.This is the first time these fish species have been found consuming plastic just days after being spawned.Jamison Gove, a researcher from the NOAA who was involved with the study, stated in the agency's news release that it is alarming that larval fish are surrounded by plastic waste and are consuming plastic at such a vulnerable stage in their life.Scientists are unsure of the impact of plastic ingestion on larval fish. The study says that plastic could affect their development or even reduce their rate of survival.Previous studies had found that plastic ingestion in adult fish causes gut blockage, malnutrition and accumulation of plastic toxins.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Silver carp linked to decline of native fish in the Mississippi River: Study</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANNew research has linked invasive species of Asian carp to a decline of native sport fish in the Mississippi River and some of its tributaries.According to a study published in the journal Biological Invasions, there are four types of Asian carp  grass, bighead, silver and black carp  in this river system.The study focused on the silver carp because the species is more abundant in the Upper Mississippi, where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been collecting data on fish for two decades.Asian carp were originally introduced to help clear out algae and weeds in sewage ponds and fish farms in the 1960s and 1970s. They escaped, entered the Mississippi River and started migrating north.The study suggests that this may have led to a decline of native sport fish such as the yellow perch, bluegill and white and black crappie during early life stages due to a dearth of plankton, which both silver carp and sport fish compete for.While analyzing fish data between 1994 to 2013, researchers found that the number of sport fish had declined by roughly 30 percent in infested areas of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers.Meanwhile, the study found that the number of native sport fish had increased by approximately 35 percent in sections of the Mississippi River farther upstream where the Asian carp had not arrived.Researchers considered other factors such as flooding, water temperatures and sediment pollution, though none of them were found to have had a significant impact on native sport fish population.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This comes amid protests against the government's plan to hike gasoline prices.The Iranian government plans to increase prices for rationed gasoline by 50 percent, the New York Times reports. Those who purchase gasoline that exceeds the ration limit will face a 300 percent increase in fuel prices.According to the NetBlocks report, some of Iran's largest mobile network operators including MCI, RIghtel and IranCell, all fell silent around 6:00 p.m. on Saturday.Authorities must work with internet service providers and mobile data providers to shut down all internet connections, reports Wired.Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks, told Wired these telecoms would also need to overcome protections in a network system which are meant to make the system resilient in case of accidental outages or bugs. Toker noted that Iran's initial internet slowdowns may have been due to these very protections in the leadup to the now almost complete internet shutdown.The clampdown on internet service is believed to be designed to limit the number of people attending protests and to hinder media coverage, according to NetBlocks.

These larvae were then co-cultured with an algae called zooxanthellae, which was grown in a lab to have higher thermal tolerance.According to a news release from the university, these corals are now living in 'coral nursery' rearer pools designed by the research team.Scientists say the rearer pools allow the baby coral to be 'turbo-charged' due to the algae which increases their chance of survival. Optical sensors were added to track the progress of the baby coral.The team now has six rearer pools housing millions of coral larvae. These corals will be dispersed onto damaged parts of the Great Barrier Reef to help form new coral communities.Peter Harrison, a researcher from the university's Marine Ecology Research Center who was involved with the study, said the technique is similar to a "battery pack" which allows the coral to soak up the algae and potentially gain more energy to grow faster.If the project is successful, "Coral IVF" could be used as a blueprint to help restore damaged or dying coral reefs around the world.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Four doses of the vaccine offer only 30 percent protection from severe malaria, for roughly three years.Children who received vaccinations were found to have a 10 times higher risk of meningitis than those given a control vaccine.A fact sheet by PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, an international non-profit organization, says the vaccine is designed to trigger the immune system when malaria parasites enter the bloodstream via mosquito bites.The vaccine blocks the parasite from infecting a person's liver, where it could potentially multiply and reenter the bloodstream to infect red blood cells. This is when symptoms of malaria usually starts to appear.Initial symptoms of malaria include fever, headache and chills. In more serious cases, children may develop severe anaemia or respiratory distress.Children under the age of 5 are the most vulnerable to the disease, according to the World Health Organization.

The pressure differentials enables the tower to pull PM 2.5 particles into its internal filtering chamber. The architects claim the smaller iteration of the Aura tower with a height of 18 meters could clean 32 million cubic meters of air per day.The firm says the taller towers will form a protective ring around Delhi's city borders to keep pollution out, while the 18 meter towers will be built by pollution hot spots inside the city.Pollution detecting drones and air cleaner attachments for cars will also form an integrated system with the towers.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
