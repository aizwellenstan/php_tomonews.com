Once coral reefs start to degrade or are damaged, reefs turn eerily quiet. This results in fish in the reefs leaving to find a new home. At the end of the experiment, scientists found that the degraded coral reefs had a 50 percent increase in the number of juvenile fish.Lead author of the study, Tim Gordon, explained in a news release that the growth of fish population choosing to stay in the damaged reefs could help to kick-start the natural recovery process for the coral reefs.Co-author of the study, Andy Radford, from the University of Bristol, said that this technique could be combined with other coral restoration techniques to help accelerate ecosystem recovery.Though Radford added that we need to combat other threats such as climate change, water pollution and overfishing in order to better protect these ecosystems in the first place.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

These robotic tools are capable of detecting gases such as ammonia and are used to find leaks in the station.NASA says the storage unit will protect the tools from space radiation, tiny meteoroids, or other high-speed objects traveling through space.The Robotic Tool Stowage's thermal system will be able to maintain a constant temperature to help the space station's robotic equipment stay functional. The location of the storage space will also make it easily accessible for the International Space Station's robotic arm called Dextre to get a hold of these tools.Once the robot hotel makes its way to the space station, astronauts will perform a spacewalk to install the storage space to the station's exterior.NASA says this type of technology could potentially be used in future space missions to the Moon, Mars, or beyond.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security has proposed a new regulation that would require all travelers  including U.S. citizens and green card holders  to undergo mandatory facial scans when entering and leaving the country.Facial recognition technology typically matches an image of a person from a photo or video with a still image of them in a database. It has become increasingly used in airports throughout the world, according to CNN. The proposed regulation would be part of a broader system to track travelers as they enter and exit the United States.According to Reuters, the Trump Administration contends the face scan requirement will combat the fraudulent use of U.S. travel documents and aid the identification of criminals and suspected terrorists.The U.S. Customs and Border Protection has already conducted pilot programs that collect photographs and fingerprints from foreign travelers, but until now, U.S. citizens had been exempt, Reuters reports.   In 2017, President Trump signed an executive order to accelerate a full roll out of airport biometrics for all domestic and international travelers.According to a statement by a senior policy analyst from American Liberties Union Jay Stanley, travelers shouldn't have to submit to "invasive biometric scans" just because they want to travel.The U.S. government has been using facial recognition technology for the past 20 years, though the government has only recently started pushing for use of this technology across U.S. airports, CNN reports.

The beating heart is then transplanted into a recipient, CNN reports. Jacob Schroder, one of the doctors involved in the heart transplant procedure, told CNN that the donor heart was doused with a cold solution and removed five minutes after the person's death was announced and after heartbeat and circulation had stopped.Physicians from Duke University Medical Center then placed the heart in the TransMedics Organ Care System. The system pumps warm blood and allows the non-beating heart to be preserved and resuscitated for a transplant.Once the heart and the heart recipient is ready, the donor heart is then transplanted into the recipient via standard heart transplant procedure.Schroder explained that the procedure could increase the donor pool and the number of transplants performed by 30 percent. This would decrease wait time and the number of deaths of those waiting for a transplant.The procedure has previously been performed in medical centers in the United Kingdom and Australia.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Their offspring are being kept at a custom built facility at SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium and will eventually be released into the wild.For the second phase of the project, the team will begin constructing "seahorse hotels," or artificial habitats for seahorses, in Sydney Harbor this month.Researchers say the seahorse hotels will provide a habitat for the project's seahorses when they are released into the wild. Monitoring of the seahorses will continue after their release.These artificial habitats will be transformed into natural habitats for White's seahorses as they are grown over by sponges, algae and other marine creatures.Researchers say the artificial habitats were previously trialled in Port Stephens in New South Wales, Australia in 2018 and earlier this year.Trials were found to be extremely successful as they attracted seahorses, leading to mating and breeding.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Reuters reports that six people, including two shooters, three civilians and a police officer, died in a series of events that ended in a police shootout on Tuesday in Jersey City. According to NBC News, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and other law enforcement leaders at the state and federal level held a press conference Wednesday to detail what took place during the incident. According to Grewal, it is believed at some point Tuesday, 47-year-old David Anderson and 50-year-old Francine Graham encountered and killed Jersey City police Det. Joseph Seals in the Bayview Cemetery in Jersey City.At roughly 12:21 p.m., a white U-Haul van driven by Anderson parked directly across the street from the JC Kosher Supermarket. Seconds later, Anderson exited the driver side door armed with a rifle as he walked toward the supermarket and immediately began shooting. Graham, who was sitting in the passenger's side of the van, then followed Anderson into the store. Inside the supermarket, the suspects encountered four civilians. Three of these civilians were killed and one survived a gunshot wound.Around 12:38 p.m., a bystander called 911 to report Seals' body in the cemetery. Grewal said that at approximately 12:43 p.m. Jersey City Police Department personnel arrived on scene and engaged the two suspects in an hours-long shootout. At approximately 3:25 p.m., an armored police vehicle broke through the front of the supermarket. Around 3:47 p.m., law enforcement discovered Anderson and Graham's bodies inside the supermarket. According to NBC News, authorities are currently in the process of identifying all available video footage from the incident.      RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Shooters encountering police officer in cemetery2.

They placed plants into three groups. These were drought-stressed plants, plants cut at the stem and control plants. These were placed in an acoustic box for an hour.Each plant was recorded with two microphones placed 10 centimeters away.On average, drought-stressed tomato plants emitted roughly 35 ultrasonic sounds per hour, while tobacco plants produced 11 per hour. Cut tomato plants created roughly 25 sounds per hour, while tobacco plants generated 15.The study found that all control plants produced, on average, less than one sound per hour.The scientists explained in the study that these sounds could potentially be heard by other organisms up to several meters away.The tomato plants were also placed in a greenhouse setting to test whether or not sounds emitted by plants would be identified outdoors. The results matched researchers' findings from the plants in the acoustic box in that plants produce more sounds as they become dehydrated.Machine learning classifiers were able to distinguish distinct noises produced by the different plants in both the acoustic box and the greenhouse setting.Researchers suggested that in the future, farmers may be able to use this type of technology to listen out for drought-stressed crops to better assess their crops.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANAstronomers from Villanova University recently published an article noting that Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion has been significantly dimmer in recent months, leading some to speculate it could go supernova.According to CNet, one possible explanation for the dimming is that Betelgeuse is out of fuel and has begun to collapse on itself resulting in a supernova explosion. Once the star explodes, the explosion would be visible during daylight and could even be brighter than the moon at night for a few weeks or even months. However, astronomers say this is unlikely.The other likely explanation is that because Betelgeuse is a variable star that has been dimming and brightening for a millennia, the dimming could just be the most significant dip in the past 50 years or so, which is a very short amount of time in the star's lifespan.

No traces of nerve agents in alleged victims' blood9. Symptoms inconsistent with a chlorine chemical attack10. COCs present in natural environment11. COC quantifier excluded from final report12. Americans stated narrative during OPCW visitVOICEOVER (in English): "On the night of April 7, 2018, Syrian military helicopters allegedly dropped chlorine bombs on the town of Douma, killing dozens of civilians.""The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons sent a fact-finding mission to investigate two sites where gas cylinders were found: a rooftop balcony and a bedroom. "According to the official OPCW report, the rooftop bomb first struck a corner of the balcony wall.""This initial impact decreased the cylinder's velocity and changed its trajectory, causing it to hit the concrete floor hard enough to make a hole and fracture the valve, but without sufficient energy to fall through."At the bedroom location, the official report maintains that the chlorine-filled cylinder fell parallel to the roof of a building and crashed through the concrete.""It fell through and briefly impacted the floor, then continued forward on an altered trajectory landing on the bed. The harness and valve remained intact, and its contents were not discharged."In a newly-leaked memo on Wikileaks, a scientist who was part of the Douma fact-finding mission told OPCW Director-General Fernando Arias that over 20 inspectors have expressed concern over inconsistencies in the official findings."The memo's author claims that  except for one FFM member who was a paramedic, all others on the ground in Douma were excluded in the production of the final report.""Instead, OPCW gathered a separate "core" group that operated from "Country X", believed to be Turkey, to create said report.""Wikileaks had also released the first draft of the report, in which investigators say they were unable to explain 'the relatively moderate damage to the cylinder...compared to the destruction caused to the rebar-reinforced concrete roof.'""Blood and other samples taken from alleged victims who fled to Turkey found no trace of any nerve agent – a finding left out in the final report.""No trace was detected in surrounding buildings or vegetation in Douma, either.""Another crucial finding involves the symptoms of the victims in the alleged chemical attack as being inconsistent with exposure to chlorine-containing choking or blood agents like chlorine gas, phosgene, or cyanogen chloride.""These directly contradict the final report, which states the investigation found "reasonable grounds that the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon took place."SOURCES: Wikileaks, Counterpunchhttps://wikileaks.org/opcw-douma/https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/11/15/the-opcw-and-douma-chemical-weapons-watchdog-accused-of-evidence-tampering-by-its-own-inspectors/***]]></description>

Mitsuhiro Mimura, a researcher at Japan's Economic Research Institute for Northeast Asia, told the publication that this is partially due to the fact that North Korea sold fishing rights around its own coastal areas to China, forcing North Korea fishermen to go further out at sea in run down wooden boats.A number of wooden boats typically wash ashore during this time of the year after northwesterly winds blow the vessels off course, as reported by NHK World News.

The final two satellites will be launched by June 2020. This will complete the network at 35 satellites. In comparison, the U.S.'s Global Positioning System, or GPS, uses approximately 30 satellites in space.China is developing a navigation system independent of the GPS in a bid to protect its own interests, Nikkei Asian Review reports. The satellite's level of location accuracy is currently within 5 meters, though Beidou Navigation Satellite System spokesperson Ran Chengqi said that the system's accuracy will improve to within centimeters by the end of next year.The company said this will help in search and rescue missions in the future.Beidou's navigation system will also be used to improve technology for self-driving vehicles and cell phones in China.According to the Nikkei Asian Review, Beidou will also include a text messaging service so that users can communicate with one another.Ran said that Beidou already has plans to export its products to roughly 120 trading partners through China's Belt and Road initiative.The country also plans to open up its navigational system to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa and eastern Europe.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe Federal Aviation Administration has proposed using remote identification for unmanned aircraft systems in the U.S.The agency proposes that drones in U.S. airspace would have to meet one of three remote identification requirements: the standard remote identification; limited remote identification; or those without any remote identification.The system would allow the government to track drones across the country and could also make it possible for third parties to track the vehicles as well, CNBC reports. The agency says that the remote ID of drones is necessary "to ensure public safety and the safety and efficiency of the airspace of the United States."Drones such as amateur built vehicles and previously manufactured aerial vehicles that may not have remote identification capabilities would be required to fly within the visual line of sight and only in FAA-recognized identification areas.The FAA states in the proposal that all drones in U.S. airspace would be required to comply with the new regulations within three years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANNew research has found that the rorqual whale species, particularly humpback whales, are able to use stealth and deception to prey on tiny fish.In a Stanford University news release, scientists said they were curious as to why the small fish weren't able to escape from their predator.The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the precise timing of the whale opening its mouth to engulf the fish allows it to avoid triggering an escape response in them.When researchers monitored anchovies' escape reaction to a virtual whale, they found that by the time the fish responded to the whale's predatory behavior, it had already expanded its jaw to capture them.The study suggests that humpback whales wait to open their jaws until they are extremely close to tiny fish in order to engulf them, a method called lunge-feeding.When whales lunge after tiny fish, their jaws expand to consume a volume of water larger than their own bodies. They then filter out the excess water before swallowing the fish they caught. This technique allows humpback whales to capture 30 to 60 percent of the school of fish at once.  Scientists did not see the whales doing the same when pursuing other prey such as krill. According to the news release, this is due to krill being less responsive to predators.David Cade, a researcher involved in the study, explained in the news release that in terms of evolution, lunge-feeding is a comparatively new eating technique for the whales.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
