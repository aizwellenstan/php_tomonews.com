London's Imperial College and technology startup Arborea are collaborating to build a 'biosolar leaf' that would be capable of removing greenhouse gases while generating oxygen to disperse into the air.Arborea founder, Julian Melchiorri, told the Guardian that this new technology is able to process carbon dioxide at an extremely low pressure.According to an Imperial College London news release, the "biosolar leaf" was made by a cultivation system that is able to grow tiny plant life such as microalgae and phytoplankton onto a solar panel-like structure.The developers claim that this technology could do the work of 100 trees while only using the surface area of one.They eventually plan to place the structures onto the roofs of large buildings in cities to improve air quality.The Biosolar Leaf cultivation system will be used on the college's White City Campus South Site as a test pilot, According to the Imperial College London news release.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Traces of their DNA are found in present-day Asians, Australians, and Melanesians.The fossil discovery suggests Denisovans had adapted to living in the low oxygen, high-altitude environment of the Tibetan plateau, which sits at an elevation of 10,760 feet.According to the Institute of Tibetan research, this genetic adaptation was likely passed on to modern Himlayan populations, who were found to have a Denisovan gene that allows them to cope with thin air.According to the New York Times, the jawbone is the first Denisovan fossil found outside Denisova Cave, and supports the theory that the species once lived across central and east Asia.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This in turn causes it to wobble like a spinning top and fire jets out in different directions.Researchers from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research say that since the black hole was moving so fast, the usual radio telescopes that rely on long exposure for imaging became useless. Instead, the team produced 103 individual images each roughly 70 seconds long, that they then joined together into a movie.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Dengue is a viral disease carried by female mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypti, which can also carry diseases such as chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika. According to the World Health Organization, roughly half of the world is at risk of contracting dengue, for which there is no specific treatment.According to Stat News, last Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the distribution of Dengvaxia, a vaccine manufactured by French pharmaceutical company, Sanofi Pasteur.The decision has sparked controversy since the vaccine was pulled from the Philippines in 2017 due to safety issues. However, the FDA has announced clear restrictions for its use in the US.Stat News reports that it can only be used in patients ages 9 through 16 that have already had one previous dengue infection, and are living in areas of the US where the virus is endemic. The virus is only present in Puerto Rico and other offshore regions in the US.The European Commission approved the use of Dengvaxia in dengue-endemic regions late last year.

The body is simply dressed in it, and then buried at an optimal depth of 4 feet, with or without a casket.The mushroom suit costs $1,500, which the company says is far less than traditional burial options that can run up to $6,000.

The area will include housing and real estate that would have flexible designs that enable multi-purpose usage.It would also include sustainable design and infrastructure to reduce landfill waste and carbon emissions.The futuristic neighborhood would use open digital infrastructure that would collect data on traffic, noise and air quality, according to the BBC. This has raised questions about what exactly the data is being gathered for.The company told the BBC that the sensors wouldn't be used for monitoring purposes and would instead allow governments to be flexible on how they want the sensors to be used in the neighborhood.According to the BBC, privacy advocates are concerned the project will increase surveillance and outsource government responsibilities to a private corporation.Privacy advocates and digital rights activists in Toronto urged the government to stop the redevelopment of the area due to privacy concerns and a lack of transparency from the U.S. based company, reported The Star.The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has now filed a lawsuit against Waterfront Toronto, the municipal, provincial and federal governments, BBC News reports.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

They found 28 recorded moonquakes between 1969 to 1977 that ranged from magnitude two to five on the Richter scale.According to NASA, the moon contracts and shrinks as its interior cools, forming geological formations called thrust faults when sections of the brittle crust are forced up over neighboring parts.Eight of the 28 epicenters were found to be within 30 kilometers of these faults.Analysis also found that six of the quakes happened when the moon was at apogee. This is the farthest point from the Earth in its orbit, and the period when our planet's gravity inflicts additional stress.Scientists believe it's likely that the stress build up as the lunar crust is compressed by global contraction and tidal forces, causes the faults to slip and produce the quakes.

According to The South China Morning Post, the Chinese loan would be the largest foreign investment in Sri Lankan history. The project is said to be part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, whereby China invests large amounts of money into a country in order to develop its infrastructure.According to the China Daily, a total of 269 hectares of land reclamation was completed in January. The basic infrastructure for the project is expected to be completed in 15 months.Plans for the city include skyscrapers, hospitals, hotels and theme parks. The port city would be turned into a major financial hub that may one day rival Singapore and Dubai, according to Chinese state media. Chinese authorities claim the project would create 83,000 jobs and attract upto US$13 billion worth of investments to develop the city.Beijing has already lent Colombo over US$8 billion dollars to fund other ambitious projects such as airports, ports, railways and more, The South China Morning Post reports. In December 2017, Sri Lanka had to hand over the Hambantota Port and 15,000 acres of land surrounding the area to China for 99 years as the country was unable to pay back a loan.Smruti Pattanaik, from the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, was quoted by the South Morning China Post as saying that, "The lure of belt and road money is hard to resist for developing nations as it provides something they are [badly] in need of  funding for infrastructure."

According to the company, the habitat would be made from materials such as biopolymer basalt composite, which can be extracted from Mars. This process would be enabled by In-situ resource utilization or ISRU, which would harvest the Red Planet's surface to collect the resources needed. The robotic 3D printers would then use the materials to print the Martian habitats.AI SpaceFactory explained on its website that Marsha utilizes a dual-shell system that would isolate the habitat from extreme weather temperature shifts on Mars.It would also include strategically placed windows that would allow natural light to enter the habitat while keeping out harmful solar and cosmic radiation.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

However, scientists cannot pinpoint what is causing the ice to recede.According to a report by ScienceMag, the late winter sea ice of the Bering Sea is falling to some of the lowest levels in the past 40 years. The report states that around March every year, sea ice usually stretches out from the south of the Bering Sea and reaches the areas surrounding the Aleutian Islands. But in 2018 it only stretched as far as Alaska. The rapid ice loss could be due to changes in wind direction and water temperature. One of the explanations offered by ScienceMag is that climate change is altering the polar jet stream, bringing warmer winds to the Bering Sea and causing the ice to recede.   Oceanographer Seth Danielson told ScienceMag the ice loss could also be a result of rising temperatures in the Bering Sea. Data gathered in early 2018 shows the sea was 2 degrees warmer than usual. This increase in temperature delays ice formation by three weeks. The ice formation and high temperatures could have also been affected by low ice coverage in 2017, which might have allowed the sea ice to absorb more heat.The lack of sea ice in 2018 also affected local ecosystems and animal life. Populations of zooplankton, algae, fish, and seabirds have already been affected. These shifts in temperature could also affect American fisheries located in the southeastern Bering Sea. If the sea ice continues to recede, fish factories in the north could be too far from fishing grounds, making it more expensive to haul fish.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Those who were part of the study had at least one first degree relative with a form of Alzheimer's.Participants of the study were asked to conduct memory, learning, reading and attention tests annually from 1995 to 2013.The researchers found an increase of the tau protein present in the cerebrospinal fluid around 30 years before any symptoms of Alzheimer's appeared. Proteins such as amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau also started to appear around 10 to 15 years before the indications of Alzheimers began to manifest.Scientists also found a slight decrease in the size of the medial temporal lobe in the brain, three to nine years before any cognitive impairment was noticeable. This part of the brain is responsible for memory. By the end of the study, 81 participants had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. The researchers plan to conduct further studies in five different research sites around the world to compare data, according to the study.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Trees between 250 and 300 years old grew around 35 percent more during the same period. The authors of the study explained that they believe that warmer soil temperatures may be causing the trees to grow rapidly. This is because roots start to expand and absorb more nutrients as the depth of the permafrost layer is lowered.A press release from Advancing Earth and Space Science, cites Xianliang Zhang, lead author of the study as saying that growth in old trees is unusual. Adding that it could be as a result of well-developed root systems present in the older trees that are able to absorb nutrients from the soil more efficiently.The researchers added that this may be good in the short term basis, but would be disastrous for forests in the long run. This is because permafrost underneath trees could degrade or no longer support trees as the climate becomes warmer.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The dome was originally built to contain radioactive waste from nuclear tests conducted by the U.S., CBS News reports.According to CBS News, the U.S. conducted 64 nuclear weapons tests at Bikini and Enewetak atolls in the Marshall Islands from 1946 to 1958.The tests included the "Bravo" hydrogen bomb, which was said to be a 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima, reports Al Jazeera. Radioactive ash and soil from nuclear explosions were put into the crater, which was closed with an 18-inch-thick concrete dome. This was originally meant to be a temporary solution with the bottom of the crater never being lined.Decades of exposure has caused cracks to develop on the surface of the concrete, raising concerns that the radioactive waste present in the dome could slowly be making its way into the Pacific Ocean, CBS News reports. Guterres, who was speaking to students in Fiji during a press event as part of his South Pacific tour, was quoted by CBS News as saying, "The consequences of these [issues] have been quite dramatic, in relation to health, in relation to the poisoning of waters in some areas."Guterres is currently touring the South Pacific to raise awareness on issues related to climate change.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the New York Times, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to ban U.S. telecom firms from using foreign-made equipment from sources that may pose a risk to national security.While no nation or company was singled out in the ban, the Commerce Department later added Huawei and its affiliates on a list of firms considered to be undermining American interests.The listing prevents Huawei from purchasing U.S. parts or technologies without the government's approval.According to CNN, U.S. officials have openly warned against using gear from Huawei and other Chinese companies, arguing that these tech products could allow China to spy on U.S. communications.Major mobile phone companies in America are largely unaffected as they don't use Huawei equipment, but the order may be costly for rural wireless carriers who do use Huawei as a cheaper alternative to European brands like Nokia or Ericsson.CNN reports that the executive order would apply to past purchases of telecom gear, though officials didn't say whether the government would help smaller carriers pay to remove or switch out their foreign gear.

Human activity has contributed to the destruction of coral reefs via overfishing, pollution and coral bleaching.  From 1930 to 1970, reefs located in Kane'ohe Bay, Hawaii were subject to dredging, coastal development and sewage dumping. All of this destroyed 95 percent of reefs.  In 1978, sewage outposts were removed from the area.Two decades later, the reef surface had recovered to between 50 and 95 percent. According to a recent study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, the reefs were able to thrive despite the acidification of the water. The team gathered branches of three main coral species from about 10 to 12 colonies in Waimanalo and Kane'ohe Bay. They exposed them to warm or acidic water in a controlled environment for five weeks.     The results showed that corals extracted from Kane'ohe Bay had a higher tolerance to warm and acidic water which allowed them to blossom more than twice as fast as the corals from Waimanalo Bay.   Christopher Jury, the lead scientist from the study, believes that because the reefs in Kane'ohe Bay have the properties to flourish in polluted environments they make the area, quote, "incredibly valuable as a possible window into the future."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The water found in the crystals most likely aided the rocks in melting while in the transition zone, according to the researchers.Previously, volcanoes were known to form when tectonic plates converge or drift apart, or when mantle plumes rise from the core-mantle boundary.The researchers had been expecting to find that Bermuda was formed a mantle plume, as was Hawaii.Senior author of the study Esteban Gazel was quoted in a Cornell University news release as saying: "With this work we can demonstrate that the Earth's transition zone is an extreme chemical reservoir.""Our next step is to examine more locations to determine the difference between geological processes that can result in intraplate volcanoes and determine the role of the mantle's transition zone in the evolution of our planet."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It can also cause serious harm to the heart, with narrowing arteries and weakening muscles resulting in an increased risk of heart attacks.Small pollution particles penetrate the lungs and are mistaken as bacteria by immune cells, which then release enzymes and acids to try and kill them.These proteins spread around the body, causing systemic inflammation. The damage is far-reaching, affecting the brain, kidneys, and pancreas.Brain conditions associated with pollution include stroke, dementia, and reduced intelligence. There's evidence to suggest poor sleep may also be a consequence of breathing in bad air.The Guardian reports that research highlighted in the review links air pollution to various cancers, including in the bladder and gut.Toxic air likewise affects bones and skin, and has been associated with brittle bones, skin aging, and hives.According to the review, exposure to polluted air can lead to reduced fertility and increased miscarriages.It poses a risk for unborn babies, with a recent study finding pollutants in fetal placentas.Air pollution is also linked to low birth weights for babies, and can lead to stunted development in children.Prof. Dean Schraufnagel, who led the reviews, is worried that doctors may be unaware of how much damage is associated with air pollution, and suggests they should pay attention, and then speak up and educate their patients.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Reuters reports that four tankers, including two Saudi ships, one UAE vessel, and one Norwegian tanker, were attacked in the United Arab Emirates on May 13.According to an insurance report by the Norwegian Shipowners' Mutual War Risks Insurance Association, the attacks against the tankers may have been carried out by a nearby vessel.The ship is thought to have released underwater drones carrying around 30 to 50 kilograms of high-grade explosives to detonate on impact. In the report, the insurance company detailed the factors that lead them to believe the attacks were organized by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, or IRGC. They claim there is a similarity in the shrapnel found on the Norwegian tanker to shrapnel in Houthi drone boats. The IRGC has also previously supplied the Houthi militia with drone boats equipped with explosives, and GPS systems for improved accuracy during strikes.  The report states that the attacks occurred around six to 10 nautical miles off Fujairah, close to the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has previously threatened to stop all exports passing through the strait.

This is how the move could affect the technology company.  Chinese tech company, Huawei, was blacklisted by the U.S. government last Monday. The tech company  as do most tech corporations  depends heavily on foreign components. Huawei's P30 Pro motherboard is an example of this. According to BBC, only two components from the motherboard are Chinese, its RF transceivers and audio chip. Both are made by HiSilicon, which is owned by Huawei.Two of the chip's front end modules which connect the phone to network signals and allows it to manage different radio frequencies are made in two separate American semiconductor firms. One is located in Massachusetts and the other in Greensboro, North Carolina. Both will be affected by the ban. The device's flash storage located at the back of the motherboard is made by a semiconductor company from Idaho called Micron Technologies. Benchmark analysts estimate that 13 percent of the company's revenue comes from Huawei.  The P30 Pro's dynamic random access memory or DRAM is also foreign.

It was, however, delayed due to high winds, according to CNet.This is the early stages of SpaceX's plans to launch an affordable high-speed broadband network into space. Starlink would be able to provide internet access to those who are yet to be connected online, according to SpaceX's website.SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was cited by Space.com as saying that the Starlink network would require around 400 satellites to provide "minor" internet coverage around the world, while 800 would be needed for "moderate" internet coverage.According to CNet, this will be the beginning of SpaceX's plans to launch a megaconstellation with as many as 12,000 satellites orbiting Earth's atmosphere.Previously, the FCC had given SpaceX permission for its satellites to orbit at a lower altitude from 1,150 kilometers to 550 kilometers.By operating satellites at a lower orbit, according to The Verge, Starlink would be able to cut down transmission time and is expected to transfer data in just 15 milliseconds.According to Tech Times, the company will need to launch six to 12 more Starlink missions in order to provide internet coverage to a larger global audience.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The bulk of an increase of trichlorofluoromethane, better known as CFC-11, in the atmosphere has been found to originate from areas in eastern China, according to a new study published in the journal Nature.The gas is believed to be stronger than carbon dioxide or methane in terms of its contribution to damaging effects from greenhouse emissions, the Guardian reports.For the study, researchers from South Korea and Japan used air monitoring stations and created model simulations with the data they collected. They found the CFC-11 molecules originated from the northeastern Chinese provinces of Shandong and Hebei.According to the study, CFC-11 emissions from these Chinese regions have increased by around 7,000 metric tons since 2013. This was a 110 percent increase compared emissions from 2008 to 2012, or 40 percent to 60 percent of the extra global CFC-11 emissions.CFCs were once commonly used in refrigerators, aerosol cans and dry cleaning chemicals before they were banned in 1987 due to their contribution to the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica under the Montreal Protocol.In response to concerns regarding CFC emissions, a Chinese official was quoted by state-run news agency Xinhua as saying: "The Chinese government has no tolerance for any illegal production of ozone-depleting substances."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
