The Remus 6000 went 2,000 feet below the surface and was equipped with a long-range sonar that scanned the sea floor. The drone also took pictures of anything that seemed unusual, CBS reports.When researchers revisited the site recently, they found cannons engraved with dolphins. The researchers claim that this is a sign the ship was the San Jose, without a doubt.The exact location the shipwreck is still kept a secret, but it was found off the coast of Cartagena, Colombia in 2015. It supposedly has a cargo full of gold, silver and emeralds that could be worth nearly $17 billion, CBS reports.Since the treasure has been discovered, both Spain and Colombia are claiming that they are the rightful owner of the ship.The researchers have mentioned that since they "are explorers, not treasure hunters," they would not be involved in the dispute between Spain and Colombia.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Fuego is a stratovolcano, which are classic-cone shaped peaks built up from layers of ash and lava rocks, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Stratovolcanoes have violent eruptions that launch columns of ash and scorching rock miles into the air. When these clouds collapse, they form deadly pyroclastic flows  avalanches of hot rocks, gas and volcanic ash.    According to the BBC, around 1.7 million people have been affected by the eruption in four regions. According to the head of the National Disaster Management Agency Sergio CabaÃ±as, the town of El Rodeo was completely "buried."The towns of Alotenango and San Miguel Los Lotes were also affected.

CPR was administered over the next 90 minutes, with the patient reportedly showing signs of conscious awareness.A high level of awareness during CPR is extremely rare, according to experts, since blood flow to the brain is often insufficient.Strangely, the man's heart remained non functioning and without electrical activity, which caused him to lose consciousness each time doctors held off on CPR.Despite being given several shots of epinephrine, his heart failed to restart on its own. The man eventually died after compressions were stopped for good.An autopsy later revealed that the patient had suffered a complete aortic dissection, a lethal condition in which blood is forced between the inner and outer aorta layers.Since the decision to terminate CPR happened while the man was still conscious, it raised serious ethical questions, including the use of sedation when resuscitating patients.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Doctors say the treatment marks the first time a T-cell immunotherapy application for late-stage breast cancer was successful. The results were published in the journal Nature Medicine. Judy Perkins, a 49-year-old engineer, from Florida was selected for the new therapy after chemotherapy failed to stop the tumor in her right breast from spreading to her liver and other areas, according to the Guardian. She was told she only had three years to live. Doctors from the National Cancer Institute in Maryland first took biopsies from Perkins' tumors, looked at the DNA mutations specific to her cancer. Physicians then extracted immune cells called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, TILs, from the biopsies. Billions of these immune cells were then grown in the lab. The researchers then injected 80 billion of the TILs into Perkins' body. The treatment was given in tandem with pembrolizumab, a standard cancer drug that helps the immune system. After 42 weeks, tests showed Perkins was completely free of cancer. According to the Guardian, researchers are now planning full scale clinical trials.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

They can come from both living and nonliving sources, and are the chemical building blocks for all life on Earth.Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument, or SAM, heated the samples to over a thousand degrees Fahrenheit, releasing small hydrocarbons that may be fragments of bigger, more complex molecules.While the organics could have resulted from biological activity, NASA says they are just as likely to have emerged from geological processes, or from a meteor crashing into the planet.Still, the discovery of the molecules sheds light on the planet's history  painting a picture of an ancient Mars that had favorable conditions for life.It likewise spurs on future explorations, with both NASA and the European Space Agency developing new technologies to search for signs of life.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The earth rotates on a tilted axis while orbiting the sun, which means different parts of the planet are pointed at or away from the sun depending on the time of year.During the solstice on June 21, the North Pole is tilted toward the sun, allowing it to shine at a 90-degree angle on the Tropic of Cancer, which sits at 23.5 degrees north of the equator.Anyone standing right on the Tropic of Cancer at noon on solstice day will see the sun directly overhead, and find themselves casting a very minimal shadow.Since the northern hemisphere faces the sun, it will experience the longest day and the start of summer. For the southern hemisphere, which tilts away from the sun, it is the shortest day and the start of winter.The opposite happens during the December's winter solstice.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers say they have figured out how Easter Islanders transported 13-ton stone hats across the island and placed them on top of 33-feet tall moai statues.The study, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, examined how ancient islanders were able to move the additional red stone cylinders, pukao, onto the tops of the statues, according to NPR. Easter Island has almost 1,000 moai statues spread across the island, with around 100 of them wearing the pukao hats. Researchers say the pukao were added later, but are unsure of the exact dates.  After constructing 3D models of the stone cylinders, scientists closely analyzed the details and features of each pukao.They developed a hypothesis that the hats were rolled up to the top of the statues using long ramps with a technique known as parbuckling.  Archaeologist Carl Lipo, co-author of the study, described the technique being similar to the way barrels used to be loaded onto cargo ships, saying "people would wrap ropes around the center of the barrel and then, from the top of the ramp, pull the barrel up the ramp. â¦ All the attributes we saw match that model." Using the 3D models, the team was able to calculate how long the ramp would have to be, in addition to how many workers would be required to pull the pukao into place. With a ramp 75 to 328 feet long, with an incline of 5 to 20 degrees, a team of 15 people could maneuver a pukao into position, according to ArsTechnica. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Moai statue with pukao2.

Scientists used the PRL Advance Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search spectrograph, or PARAS, to measure the mass of a planet travelling around a star.The surface temperature of the planet is approximately 600 degrees Celsius, which makes it virtually uninhabitable. Distance-wise, it is seven times closer to its sun-like star in comparison to Earth and its sun.It takes around 19.5 days to complete one rotation around its Sun-like star.The scientists believe elements such as ice, silicates, and iron content make up around 60-70 percent of the total mass of the planet, based on the calculations of the mass and the radius, reports The Economic Times.This type of a discovery is crucial in our understanding of how these types of planets are formed, the Financial Express reports.

The 130 to 200-foot wide asteroid that hit Tunguska, Russia in 1908, for example, levelled over 700 square miles of forest, and would have been able to destroy the entire metropolitan New York area.The outlined plan involves five main goals. The first involves enhancing detection of near-Earth objects, or asteroids that pass within 28 million miles of Earth's orbit. The second goal is to improve modelling and prediction, to help determine when and where a potential asteroid strike will occur.The third objective is to come up with new ways to deflect an asteroid, such as the Double Asteroid Redirection Test that's set to be launched in 2021.Goal four aims to increase international cooperation, while the fifth and final goal calls for the U.S. to come up with an emergency plan should an asteroid ever crash with little to no warning.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that Florida's Orlando International Airport is set to be the first U.S. airport to use facial scanners to process passengers on all inbound and outbound international flights.The scans will be checked against passenger passport photos and travel information on a Department of Homeland Security database, to verify a travelers identity.Biometric screening is expected to speed up passenger processing, but concerns have been voiced over privacy and potential information theft.In response, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection says scans in the database are deleted after 14 days, but could be removed almost immediately in the future. Photos of foreign nationals, however, are also kept in the Automated Biometric Identification System for up to 75 years.The system currently claims to have a 99% accuracy rate, though officials can manually screen passports and fingerprints if a photo doesn't match or a U.S. citizen decides to opt out.Once fully implemented, facial scanners will be stationed inside the airport's 30 international departure gates and two CBP checkpoints.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANScientists have successfully made pigs resistant to a deadly virus by editing their genes.According to the study, published in the Journal of Virology, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome  or PRRS  causes breathing problems and death in young pigs, and stillborns in infected sows.To address this, researchers from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute used gene editing to remove a small section of the pigs' CD163 receptor, which the PRRS virus attaches to. They then exposed the gene-edited pigs to the virus and found that the animals did not become infected.Scientists say the genetic edit is permanent, meaning the pigs' resistance to the disease will be passed down through natural breeding.The Edinburgh team stressed that unlike genetic modification, which is highly controversial, no foreign genes are added in during the editing process. But with no regulations in place, it may take years before the technology can be applied to commercially raised swines.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Even activities like hiking, farming, or wildlife-viewing evoked the same behavioral pattern.The consequences are potentially negative. Animals that lack the traits to thrive nocturnally become vulnerable to non-human predators, affecting their chances at survival and reproduction.Scientists have already noticed some of these changes.
