Twenty-three of those who got sick were hospitalized.The outbreak has been linked to the consumption of fresh papayas imported from Mexico.According to the Mayo Clinic, salmonella bacteria typically live in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals, and are shed through feces. Humans become infected mostly through contaminated water or food.The CDC reports that symptoms typically show 12 to 72 hours after infection, and may include abdominal cramps, high fever, and diarrhea.It usually lasts from 4 to 7 days, with patients recovering without treatment. But complications arise when the infection leaves the intestinal tract and enters the bloodstream.The Mayo Clinic reports that in such cases, it can infect tissues in the body, including those surrounding the brain and spinal cord, the lining of the heart, valves, or blood vessels, and bones or bone marrow.According to the CDC, an estimated 450 people in the U.S. die from acute salmonellosis each year.The elderly, children younger than five, and those with weakened immune systems are more vulnerable to severe infections.Methods to prevent the spread of salmonella include hand washing after using the toilet, changing diapers, or handling raw meat.Raw meat, poultry, and seafood should also be kept separate from cooked food, fruits, and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. 62 people from 8 U.S. states sick from salmonella uganda infection2.

They also spray-painted messages across the walls and shattered furniture.At midnight, police charged toward the building after several warnings earlier in the evening to clear it, firing tear gas at the rest of the crowd outside as they advanced.The streets were cleared within an hour, with only media and police remaining.The violent display came after a peaceful weeks-long demonstration, in which hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers flocked to the streets to protest a controversial China extradition law.Like the Chinese government, Lam  likewise condemned the "extreme use of violence," adding that Hong Kong authorities will "pursue any illegal acts" carried out by demonstrators.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The fox travelled 3,506 kilometers in just 76 days.Researchers say the fox covered an average of 46.3 kilometers a day, sometimes reaching 155 kilometers.She slowed down on only two occasions. Scientists think she may have either sat out bad weather, or found a source of food.The Polar Institute reports that the transmitter collar stopped working in February 2019, so the fox's current whereabouts are unknown.They do say she will likely need to change her eating habits, because while Svalbard foxes subsist on a mainly marine diet, those in Ellesmere Island live largely on lemmings.According to CNN, the Arctic is heating up twice as fast and causing a massive melting of sea ice, which is having an impact on arctic foxes.The BBC reports that in time, the population on Svalbard might become completely isolated. But researcher Eva Fuglei says there's hope, as higher temps mean more Svalbard reindeer, whose carcasses the foxes scavenge off.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Arctic fox fitted with transmitter collar2.

Oumuamua could be a fragment of a much larger object shredded before it was ousted, a process that elongated it.The scientists who suggested that the object could be an alien spacecraft also argued that the dearth of similar natural objects in space suggests that Oumuamua should never have been found, and may, therefore, have been intentionally aimed at Earth.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to The Intercept, the Democratic Party currently has more than 25 presidential candidates. With four to five garnering significant support in the polls, there may not be a clear frontrunner by next July's Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee."In order to get the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, candidates need to win a 51% majority, or at least 2,026 of the 4,051 delegates during the first ballot  the initial vote of the convention.Otherwise, the nomination goes to a brokered convention, where delegates vote until a majority is achieved, and a nominee secured.Also participating in these subsequent ballots are superdelegates, a group of elected officials, party leaders, and other party insiders that are unpledged. This means they are free to support any candidate in the party primary. For the 2020 Democratic National Convention, there will be 764 superdelegates.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

"Otherwise, the nomination goes to a brokered convention, where delegates vote until a majority is achieved, and a nominee secured.""Also participating in these subsequent ballots are superdelegates, a group of elected officials, party leaders, and other party insiders that are unpledged. This means they are free to support any candidate in the party primary.""For the 2020 Democratic National Convention, there will be 764 superdelegates.""Superdelegates were first added to the Democratic Party in 1984 to give party leaders more influence over the nominations.""Newsweek reports that the aim was to produce stronger nominees, and according to the Intercept, to guard against candidates viewed as political liabilities.""In 2016, Bernie Sanders supporters accused the party of tipping the scales in favor of Hillary Clinton, who received 571 superdelegates, compared to only 45 for Sanders.""The Democratic Party has since changed the rules, allowing superdelegates to vote only in the case of a brokered convention.""Many are worried that if a brokered convention were to occur, powerful party insiders and superdelegates could override the voters' choice and in effect decide who becomes the next Democratic presidential nominee."SOURCES: The Intercept, Newsweek, CNNhttps://theintercept.com/2019/06/30/superdelegates-2020-democratic-nominee/https://www.newsweek.com/superdelegates-democratic-party-voters-wishes-465947https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/democrats-superdelegates-voting-changes/index.html***]]></description>

This is because the rover is too small and is unable to carry a radio powerful enough to communicate with earth.MoonRanger is one of 12 proposals selected by NASA as part of its Lunar Surface and Instrumentation and Technology Payload program.

They belonged to five adults  four men and one woman  and six children.The practice of artificial cranial deformation is typically done in infancy, when the baby's skull is still soft and malleable. The head can either be compressed using hands, wrapped tightly with cloth, or shaped using boards. According to Science alert, it has no negative impact on cognitive function.Researchers say the practice of skull reshaping was a marker of social status, and may have been reserved for high-status individuals.In one tomb, a three-year-old with an elongated skull was found buried with large amounts of pottery and artifacts, suggesting the child was from a rich family.Intentionally reshaped skulls have previously been found in other parts of the world, in southeastern Australia and western Asia.To know more about the ancient practice, scientists say more research will need to be conducted to compare Houtaomuga with other Neolithic sites around the world.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Cosmos Magazine reports that water is used to produce energy, and in turn, a significant amount of energy is needed to produce clean drinking water.According to Peng Wang of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, solar panels only convert 20% of the light they absorb into electricity; the remaining 80% is released into the air.To address this, university researchers have designed a system that can use this waste heat to generate fresh, clean water.The system is made up of a three-layer distillation system attached to the underside of a solar panel.Waste heat from the panel is directed to the uppermost layer, where it vaporizes seawater. The vapor passes through a porous membrane to the second layer, where it condenses as freshwater. Heat produced during condensation passes through a thermal conduction layer, where the energy is recycled to purify more water.The stacked system was able to produce 1.64 liters of water per square meter of solar panel surface each hour.According to the researchers, it's more than double the output of more traditional solar stills. The panel's electricity output was also unaffected by the distillation going on underneath.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Water-energy nexus2.

This is because their visual cortices are intact, just not stimulated because the eye is not receiving any information.Yosher explained that for these patients with acquired blindness, there is potential to directly activate the neurons responsible for seeing, in order to restore functional sight.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reports that the exercise was first launched in March this year.Pentagon Spokesman Dave Eastburn said this is a regular exercise that shows U.S. commitment to their alliance with South Korea, and to the defense of the Korean Peninsula.During the exercise, the two sides will assess Seoul's initial operational capability. This is to verify whether South Korea is on track for its plan to retake wartime operational control of combined forces from the U.S. by 2022.The three requirements for the transfer include: South Korea acquiring key military capabilities to lead their combined forces, securing capabilities to respond early to nuclear and missile threats from North Korea and favorable security circumstances on the Korean Peninsula, according to Yonhap News Agency.According to North Korea News, the country's state-run Korean Central News Agency issued two statements criticizing the upcoming exercise as a violation of an agreement made between the U.S. and North Korea in last year's Singapore summit.North Korea said this would affect "working-level negotiations" between the U.S. and DPRK.North Korea also hinted that it may not abandon its nuclear weapons.

Security Council as saying that Britain's HMS Montrose then contacted the Iranian vessel in order to prevent the Iranians from boarding the ship.The HMS Montrose warned that they would be violating international law by boarding the tanker unlawfully.Footage obtained by Reuters shows masked Iranian Revolutionary Guards seizing the Stena Impero by descending from helicopters, similar to how British authorities captured an Iranian tanker a few weeks ago.The footage also showed the tanker  with an Iranian flag hoisted on top  docked in an Iranian port.Britain called the act 'hostile' but have yet to take action against Iran. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in a statement that while the move was "unacceptable," their priority is to "de-escalate the situation."According to Sky News, Iran has suggested that its actions were a response to the UK detaining its oil tanker on July 4, with a spokesperson for Iran's Guardian Council saying "the rule of reciprocal action is well-known in international law."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The ongoing protests began on July 15.Mauna Kea already has 13 telescopes built on its land, according to the BBC.Some native Hawaiians consider Mauna Kea's summit to be sacred and are against the construction of what would be one of the largest telescopes in the world.The Thirty Meter Telescope's primary mirror would be 30 meters wide. This would be three times as wide as the world's largest visible light telescope.According to the project's website, the telescope would be 200 times more sensitive in detecting objects, stars and other exoplanets in the universe, compared to existing ground-based telescopes and small telescopes in space.Researchers plan to use the telescope to study the properties of distant supernovae to gain a better understanding of how dark energy and dark matter were involved in the evolution of our universe. Scientists also plan to use the telescope to study the links between black holes and their host galaxies.Hawaiian Governor David Ige announced on July 10 that construction on the summit was to begin on July 15.However, around 2,000 activists have since blocked Mauna Kea Access Road to the summit in a bid to prevent construction on the site, while 34 have been arrested.Those protesting say they are fighting for their families and to protect sacred land and culture, Hawaii News Now reports.Some Native Hawaiians believe the summit is a place of worship and prayer and considered it "kapu"  or forbidden.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

More than half the structure will be submerged underwater.According to the project's website, salmon will be grown 10 to 40 meters beneath the surface of the water, to limit exposure to sea lice and algae.They will live in a large net in the bottom section that drapes down 40 meters from the lower pontoon, while a roof net will prevent fish from swimming to the top section.To accommodate the fish, four decompressors will be added in the support columns to create air pockets.The fish farm will also make use of an automatic feeder that would release fish feed underwater one to three times a day.Each column will have camera and oxygen sensors to monitor the salmon. The sensors will transmit data to an onboard server, which is connected by fiber optic cable to a crewed barge 400 meters from the farm, according to IEEE Spectrum.Once the salmon weigh 1.5 kilograms, they will be moved to open ocean pens, where they will remain for 10 to 11 months before being harvested.According to IEEE Spectrum, the fish farm could help meet Norway meet growing demands for salmon as the country's third largest export is salmon.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN.NASA and the European Space Agency have decided on a halo orbit for humanity's first lunar outpost.According to an ESA press release, the Gateway space station will follow a near-rectilinear halo orbit, or NRHO. Gateway will pass 3,000 kilometers from the lunar surface ant its closest, and 70,000 kilometers at its furthest.

Security Council.He said the U.N. is planning to send a team to assess the tanker within the next two weeks, once they have secured their entry permits.According to the Atlantic Council, crude oil is stored in a storage tank, its airspace needs to be regularly injected with inert gases to keep oxygen levels below 11 percent, otherwise the tank becomes flammable.Doug Weir, research and policy director at the Conflict and Environment Observatory, told CNN there are concerns about an explosion on the Safer. He explained that since the tanker's engines haven't been running, no inert gases are being pumped to stop the build-up of explosive gases.In his speech, Lowcock said that if the tanker explodes, it could pollute the coastline of the Red Sea.The oil spill could reach from Bab el Mandeb to the Suez Canal and as far as the Strait of Hormuz, depending on the water currents and time of the year.He warns that such an incident would be a global disaster, with dire consequences on the environment, shipping lanes and global economy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The anti-government and pro-democracy protests have been going on for eight consecutive weekends.On Sunday, demonstrators in Hong Kong defied police orders, with one group of protesters marching towards the Causeway Bay shopping area, while the other made their way to China's Liaison Office through the territory's central business district.The activists who made their way to the heavily fortified Chinese office were blocked from entering by riot police, while a clear plastic shield was added to protect a national emblem that had been defaced by protesters on July 1, Reuters reports.As the crowds grew larger, police began firing rounds of tear gas, rubber bullets and sponge grenades, resulting in a cloud of burning smoke.Protesters across the city set up barricades and chanted slogans such as "free Hong Kong" and "reclaim Hong Kong," according to the BBC. The activists have called for greater democracy and for Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam to resign, CNN reports. They are also pushing for an investigation into alleged police brutality.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office was to hold a press conference later today to "give its stance and views on Hong Kong's current situation," an announcement for the briefing stated.According to the South China Morning Post, this is the first time the administrative agency has held a briefing on Hong Kong since the city was handed over to China in 1997.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's visit to New York in mid-July also angered China.According to Bloomberg, the ban may be yet another attempt to isolate both Taiwan and its independence-leaning president, as well as hurt her chances at re-election next January.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Will artificial refreezing help save Antarctica and the Arctic?</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANScientists have suggested plans to save Antarctic glaciers and Arctic sea ice by refreezing them.According to Reuters, scientists believe the West Antarctic ice sheet is on course to disintegrate due to the effects of global warming.This would trigger a global sea level rise that would leave many coastal cities, such as New York, underwater.To prevent this from happening, a new study published in Science Advances has proposed using 12,000 wind turbines to pump sea water to the surface, turn it into artificial snow and then pump it onto two glaciers on the West Antarctic coast.According to study co-author Anders Levermann it would take 7.4 trillion tonnes of snow over a 10-year period to result in a two-centimeter drop in sea level, though the  artificial snow would weigh the glaciers down and improve stability.Other research suggests warm water currents may be melting the glaciers from the bottom up, prompting an idea to construct giant sills or underwater mounds to prevent the water from seeping under the ice shelves.CNBC reports that Arizona State University physicist Steven Desch has similar refreezing plans for the Arctic.His Arctic ice management strategy calls for the use of wind-powered pumps to spray water to the surface of sea ice, where it would freeze and thicken the ice cap.Many scientists believe the consequences of global warming are already inevitable, and when they do occur, we can't just stop it. Since efforts to curb this problem aren't keeping pace with the Paris Agreement, Desch suggests it's time to start looking into unconventional options.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
