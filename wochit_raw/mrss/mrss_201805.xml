It informed customers over email it was a proactive move and that there were no accidents or injuries related to the issue, according to Reuters. Bolts, made by German supplier Bosch, in the power steering component can start to corrode after contact with certain types of road salt in colder climates. The carmaker said 123,000 Model S cars around the world have the bolts. "We have observed excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts, though only in very cold climates, particularly those that frequently use calcium or magnesium road salts, rather than sodium chloride (table salt)," Tesla wrote in an email to customers.If the bolts fail, drivers would still be able to steer the vehicle, they would just have to use more force "due to loss or reduction of power assist," Tesla wrote. According to Tesla, the retrofit takes about an hour. The company said it would inform owners once the retrofit is available in their area. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Smartphones emit non-ionizing radiation, measured in radio-frequency, RF, energy. It's accepted high doses of ionizing radiation, such as X-rays, CT scans and nuclear power plants cause cancer, according to Scientific American.  However, it's still unclear if long-term exposure to non-ionizing radiation can cause cancer. Researchers from the U.S. National Toxicology Program tested 3,000 rats and mice of both sexes for two years, while European scientists at the Ramazzini Institute in Italy studied 2,500 rats from fetal stage to death. The studies found that prolonged exposure to even low levels of RF radiation cause male rats to develop rare heart tumors called schwannoma, which affects a neuron called a Schwann cell.In the Ramazzini study, researchers also found a weaker link between RF exposure and glial cell cancer in the brain of female rats.

According to the National Park Services, Americans use about 500 million straws a day which works out to 1.5 straws a person every 24 hours, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In the U.K., 8.5 billion plastic straws are used each year, according to the Telegraph. Straws are difficult to recycle and usually end up in landfills or being incinerated, but they are increasingly clogging up waterways as well. Cities worldwide are increasingly discouraging the use of straws with some even outright banning them. Others have vowed to phase out plastics over the next decades. Plastic straw alternatives have also started to gain in popularity. They are made from materials like bamboo, metal, glass, paper, potato or corn paste.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANMIT researchers have developed a new imaging system that can estimate the distance of objects obscured by fog. One of the main challenges to the development of self-driving navigation systems that use visible light is their inability to handle misty or foggy driving conditions. The system uses a time-of-flight camera, which emits short laser bursts at objects and then counts how long it takes for the light to bounce back. Fog normally scatters laser light, which is problematic for autonomous vehicles. But thanks to an algorithm developed by the scientists, the system can find patterns in the scattered light to calculate distance.  Researchers tested the system in fog much denser than cars would encounter in the real world. The team from MIT Media Lab's Camera Culture Group found that the system performed even better than human vision.  The goal is to integrate the system into autonomous vehicles so that even in bad weather, self-driving cars can avoid obstacles.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Autonomous vehicle driving through fog2.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up a countrywide lab network in 2016 to help hospitals diagnose infections quickly in order to stop them from spreading, according to Scientific American. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 221 cases in 2017 of a rare breed of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One in four germ samples analyzed by the CDC lab network found special genes that allow them to spread resistance to other bacteria. The CDC also said in 11 percent of people tested carried these superbugs without displaying any symptoms.People infected with these bacteria spread the disease to other people in the hospital, such as patients, doctors and nurses. These people can then in turn act as silent carriers and infect others even if they don't become sick.

Scientists from the University of Columbia published their results in the journal Cell Stem Cell on Thursday. Lead researcher Dr. Maura Boldrini and her team examined the brains of 28 dead people age 14 to 79 to see if aging affects neuron production, according to the L.A. Times. The team looked for the presence of neurons in different stages of development, including stem cells, intermediate progenitor cells, immature neurons and new neurons. The study only looked at the hippocampus, partly because previous studies have shown that part of the brain is one of the few areas that can make new neurons into adulthood, according to the L.A. Times. Boldrini and her team found similar numbers of neural progenitor cells and immature neurons, regardless of age.

The last advisory had been sent out 13 years ago, when women were told not to consume alcohol while pregnant.During an overdose, synthetic drugs like heroin or fentanyl flood the brain and lock onto the opiate receptors, causing breathing to become dangerously slow.According to the advisory from the Surgeon General's Office, Naloxone can reverse the effects of an overdose and comes in two forms  a nasal spray, and a syringe that should be injected into the muscles of the thigh, buttocks or arms.The emergency medication works by knocking the opioids out of the receptors in the brain  blocking and temporarily reversing their effects for 30 to 90 minutes.Police officers and medical responders are among those who have been using Naloxone to counter overdose deaths.The life-saving drug is also available at local pharmacies and local health departments.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This can refer to applications like Alexa or Siri, or programs with more malicious intentions, like viruses.On Twitter, bots are software-controlled accounts capable of tweeting or retweeting without direct human input.A recent Pew Research Center study that analyzed 1.2 million tweeted links found that only one third were sent by humans. The rest were posted by suspected bots.The study found that 66% of tweeted links to sites covering news were shared by bots, compared to 90% for adult sites, 76% for sports, and 73% for commercial products.Interestingly, the bots' link-sharing behavior wasn't slanted toward a specific political stance. The number of links to sites shared by liberals was roughly the same as to those shared by conservatives.It's worth noting that the researchers didn't assess the accuracy of material being shared, or distinguish between good and bad bots  which means it's still unclear how useful or problematic Twitter bots actually are.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The RemoveDebris satellite was launched into space on April 2 aboard a SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, according to Tech Times.  It was developed by several companies in conjunction with the European Space Agency.The satellite weighs 100 kilograms and comes equipped with a 30 centimeter long 'harpoon' that can be shot towards space debris in order push it away from functioning satellites. It also has a net that can be launched towards objects. After wrapping around the debris, the net can be cut loose to burn while reentering the Earth's atmosphere. After being deployed from the ISS, the satellite will conduct preliminary tests attempting to capture cubesats acting as space junk.  Tests will also be carried out on the spacecraft's ability to use its laser navigation technology to track space fragments that are spinning out of control. Researchers are expected to start testing the spacecraft within the next few weeks. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. RemoveDebris satellite being released from ISS2. RemoveDebris harpoon3. RemoveDebris net4.

On October 11, 2017, triathlete and marathon runner Tim Don was involved in an accident when a vehicle turning into a gas station struck him in the side, according to the New York Times. Don experienced a hangman's fracture, a broken C2 vertebra. In order to keep competing, Don elected to have a halo put on. With a halo, titanium pins are screwed into the skull, two in front and two in back and then attached to metal bars, which are connected to a bust that must be worn for three months. Training in the halo has been extremely painful for Don. He's worked on strengthening his core and lower body. He was also able to train on an exercise bike as long as he did not lean forward to overload his neck.   Don says he expects to finish the marathon in around 2 hours and 50 minutes. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The UCLA team found 35 people ranging in age from 45 to 75 and asked their physical activity levels and the average number of hours per day spent sitting the week before. A high-resolution MRI scan was taken of each subject's medial temporal lobe, MTL. The MTL is the region of the brain involved when forming new memories. The scientists found that sedentary behavior is a significant predictor of thinning of the MTL and that physical activity is not enough to offset the harmful effects of prolonged periods of sitting. This is not to say that sitting too much causes thinner brain structures, but instead that extended periods seated are associated with thinner sections, the researchers said. According to the researchers, MTL thinning can be a precursor to cognitive decline and dementia in middle-aged and older adults. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

"Today, I am pleased to officially announce that SpaceX will start production development of the Big Falcon Rocket in the Port of Los Angeles. This vehicle that holds the promise of taking humanity even deeper into the cosmos than ever before," Garcetti said during an annual speech, according to the Los Angeles Times.  The Big Falcon Rocket is a two-part launch vehicle designed to transport 100 people and 150 tons of cargo into space, according to Business Insider. When completed, it will be more than 348 feet tall.  The fully reusable rocket can be quickly refuelable and is designed to burn liquid methane, which can be manufactured on other planets and moons in the solar system, including Mars. According to public documents, SpaceX asked for permission to lease a 19-acre site called Berth 240 at the former Southwest Marine Shipyard. SpaceX wants to build a 200,000 square-foot rocketship factory on a historic site, so will now need to get approval from the port's Board of Harbor Commissioners. The initial 10-year lease, which contains two options for 10-year extensions, has a starting annual rent of around $1.38 million with annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index, according to the LA Times.

When the left engine blew apart, it sent shrapnel through the plane, killing one passenger, and leaving a hole in the aircraft, according to CNN. The hole caused the cabin to depressurize, and the oxygen masks to drop down. One photo from passenger Marty Martinez shows several passengers wearing oxygen masks incorrectly. To properly use the mask, pull down on the mask until the plastic tubing is fully extended. Put the mask over you mouth and nose and breathe regularly. At altitudes over 15,000 feet, people struggle to breathe and keep their blood oxygenated.

      <title>&#x2018;Man with three faces&#x2019; suffers from rare genetic condition</title>
      <description><![CDATA[French man Jérôme Hamon has become the world’s first patient to undergo two face transplants. He suffers from neurofibromatosis type 1.According to the Mayo Clinic, Neurofibromatosis 1, or NF1, is a genetic condition that causes tumors to form along nervous tissue. These tumors are typically benign, but in some cases can become malignant and cancerous.Indicators of the condition include six or more flat, light-brown skin spots, small bumps on the iris, and bumps under the skin. The Mayo Clinic says signs typically appear around the age of 10. Other symptoms of NF1 are bone deformities, optic nerve tumors, affected individuals being below average height and perhaps having learning disabilities.According to the BBC, Hamon’s NF1 causes severe tumors to form around his face. Hamon underwent his first face transplant in 2010 but had to go under the knife again in 2017 after medication for a cold caused his body to reject the transplant. That was removed last November, leaving Hamon unable to speak, hear or see for several months.Hamon remained like that in a Paris hospital until January when he received a second facial transplant, according to the BBC.  French media have called him the “man with three faces”. Despite all he’s been through, he remains upbeat, telling French TV, “I’m 43 and the donor was 22, so I’m 22 again.”Information from the Britain’s National Health Service says NF1 typically affects one in 3,000 people. Worldwide it affects 3 million people.A 2014 study by the Washington University in St. Louis found members of both sexes have almost equal chances of developing the condition, but it affects both differently. Females are at more risk for brain tumors and vision, while males may suffer more from learning disabilities.There’s no cure for NF1, but treatment of the condition can involve pain medication, monitoring, and for cancerous tumors, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery is used on both cancerous and noncancerous tumors.]]></description>

Transplant livers are normally kept prior to surgery, however many become damaged and unusable as a result, according to the BBC. The findings were published on April 18 in the journal Nature. For the study, researchers kept donated livers "alive" in a perfusion machine, pumping the organs with blood, nutrients and medicines. The trial involved 222 liver transplants at seven European medical centers. It looked at cold transplants versus warm livers connected to a perfusion machine. The participants were randomly picked to receive a liver warm liver or one preserved on ice. The scientists found 50 percent less tissue damage in the warm livers. They also found that warm livers had a higher transplant success compared to cold ones. Only 16 out of 137 warm livers had to be discarded, compared to 32 out of 133 cold ones.Researchers hope the study can help reduce the number of people that die waiting for transplants each year.

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch has an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastics brought there by ocean currents and is roughly three times the size of France, according to an article published in Scientific Reports. The Ocean Cleanup, started by 23-year-old Boyan Slat, has designed a massive 2,000-foot long, floating tube that will serve as a barrier to trap plastic.It's made from HDPE plastic and is flexible enough to bend with the waves, but rigid enough to form a U-shaped barrier to trap floating plastics pollution, according to Fast Company. A nylon screen is attached underneath to catch plastics, but not be a threat to marine life. Large floating anchors, hundreds of feet below the surface, help steady the device so it moves slower in the current than the plastic, making it possible to pick up the garbage in front of the device. Ocean Cleanup spokesperson Joost Dubois said that when the final systems are sent out to the Pacific ocean, there will be 60 floating scoops in total. Boats will come every six to eight weeks to collect the plastics and take them to shore to be recycled.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The plastics collector being taken out to sea2.

It caused an initial 6.3 magnitude tremor, and triggered several more earthquakes in the weeks that followed.Geologists from the University of Science and Technology of China analyzed the region's seismic data and found that the blast vaporized surrounding rock, creating a 200-meter hole as the area collapsed in on itself.A large section of the mountain ridge near the peak is also believed to have broken off as a result of shock waves.Researchers from the Jilin Earthquake agency reported similar findings, and added that the collapse created a chimney which could leak radioactive fallout into the air.Both studies concluded the testing site to be unstable and unusable.The area is located close to the Chinese border.

According to ABC News, in one of the studies, subjects were told to eat 1.5 ounces of dark chocolate, and then their brain waves were analyzed on an EEG machine. Researchers found an increase in gamma waves 30 minutes after consuming the chocolate. According to principal researcher Dr. Lee Burk, "gamma frequency is associated with neurosynchronization, in other words neuroplasticity  It is the highest level of cognitive processing." In another study led by Dr. Burk, scientists look at the effect of dark chocolate on the immune system. Subjects were again given a dark chocolate bar the first week. The following week, they had their blood work analyzed. Researchers say they found an increase in anti-inflammatory markers and infection-fighting T-cells. Neither study was published, and both studies only had 10 participants. A third study published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology investigated the link between chocolate and vision. In two separate tests, 30 subjects were given two chocolate bars, both dark and milk chocolate, and conducted vision tests roughly two hours later.

The scenario would see 40 10-barrel stations located on empty land areas or at sea due to noise, firing five shots per hour, for 24 hours a day for 250 days of the year.The scenario also envisaged the naval rifle firing a projectile containing alumina into the stratosphere. Once there it there it would disperse the substance. Alumina, like sulfur dioxide, can also reflect ultraviolet light.The academy's Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy drafted the plan in a 1992 publication titled 'Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming: Mitigation, Adaptation, and the Science Base'.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

However, a couple of days later, the fever returned.When Lacey took Elianna to the doctor, she was advised to take her daughter to the nearest emergency room immediately.Lacey said that Elianna's heart rate was running high, her oxygen level was low, and her skin was turning purple.
