CNN reports that several hours after touchdown, the Chang'e 4 deployed the Yutu-2 to roam and explore the surface.According to a paper published in Science Advances, the rover used its Lunar Penetrating Radar to send radio signals to the lunar subsurface, up to a depth of 40 meters.Paper author Li Chunlai says this is three times the depth that the Chang'e 3, China's previous mission, was able to measure.After combining the radar image with tomographic data and quantitative analysis, researchers found that the subsurface was made primarily of highly porous, granular material, embedded with boulders of different sizes.According to CNN, this is likely due to the moon being frequently hit by meteors and other space debris during the early days of the solar system.When an object strikes the moon, the impact ejects a wave of material. The cratered surface becomes the top layer over time, with layers of boulder and fine debris buried beneath.Researchers say the findings could shed more light on the geological evolution of the moon's dark side.

Initial symptoms of the coronavirus diseases, or Covid-19, include fever followed by a dry cough, according to BBC News. Patients suffering from Covid-19 could develop shortness of breath after a week. This may lead some to be hospitalized for further treatment.The BBC noted that symptoms are similar to those of common viruses such as the cold or the flu.The World Health Organization states that the incubation period for coronavirus diseases lasts up to 14 days. The incubation period may be longer and could last up to 24 days, BBC News reports, citing researchers. It's unclear how exactly the virus that causes Covid-19 spreads, though similar viruses are typically spread through droplets that are produced when a person who has contracted the virus sneezes or coughs.The United Kingdom's National Health Service advised the public to wash hands frequently with soap or use hand sanitizer, sneeze or cough into a tissue or into your sleeve and avoid touching the face with unwashed hands.In more severe cases, Covid-19 could lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, organ failure or even death.The virus, which is officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, originated in China.

The huge eruption occurred in the Ophiuchus cluster, a constellation of galaxies 390 light years distant from Earth in the Virgo Cluster.According to the paper that will be published in The Astrophysics Journal, a supermassive black hole in the core of the cluster's central galaxy had expelled matter and energy so violently that it smashed a vast hole in the surrounding gas.The black hole created jets that accelerated electrons to nearly the speed of light, which resulted in radio waves that filled the cavity left in the eruption's wake.BBC reports astronomers first noticed something strange with the cluster's central galaxy when NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory telescope in 2016 saw the unusual curve of its edge. A second science team later used the data from radio telescopes to confirm that a black hole had blasted the cavity into existence by tracking the radio plasma in the gap.The study's lead author Simona Giacintucci at the Naval Research Laboratory is cited by MIT Technology Review as saying the cavity is so large that 15 Milky Way galaxies could fit inside its volume in a row.According to co-author Professor Melanie Johnston-Hollitt at the Murchison Widefield Array, the gap is so vast that light traveling across its distance from one end will not reach the other for 1.5 million years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This new technique is cost-effective, time-saving and has less impact on the natural landscape, according to a news release from Vienna University of Technology.The Lafnitz Bridge in Austria was built vertically instead of horizontally with scaffolding, like traditional bridges.Using this technique, engineers erected two vertical concrete piers and attached steel girders on both sides. As the piers are then slowly lowered using hydraulic systems, the steel girders unfold.Once the bridge has opened up to reach a horizontal position, concrete is added to the structure.The 116-meter Lafnitz Bridge was "unfolded" over the Lafnitz River on February 27, 2020.Johann Kollegger, a professor at the Vienna University of Technology, explained in the news release that traditional bridges erected using scaffolding can take months to be completed.Using this new technique, the elements for the lowering method can be set up in two to three days while the lowering process itself takes roughly three hours.Kollegger noted that the technique could be used to build bridges in difficult terrain or "terrain that should be not disturbed," such as nature reserves.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

On the darker side these can recombine into molecules.The exoplanet orbits the star differently to how Earth orbits the Sun. Earth rotates as it circles the sun. The exoplanet does not. The Guardian reports that, similar to Earth's moon, the exoplanet is "tidally locked".

The study published in Science says the virus targets a type of receptor found on human cells in the lungs, heart, kidneys and intestines.""Citing Kingston University microbiologist Mark Fielder, Sky News reports that the virus seems to attack two types of lung cells: goblet cells that coat the respiratory tract with mucus, and ciliated cells that usually filter out pathogens.""A previous study published in Science found the virus' spike protein has two receptor binding domains, or RBDs, facing downward and another facing upward. These allow the virus to bind with and invade human cells.""According to the new study, the virus targets a human ACE2 receptor that has bonded with an amino acid transporter. This subtype of ACE2 structure has never been discovered before.""The virus uses the spike protein's 'up' RBD to penetrate the cell.

The study, published in the journal JAMA, looked at 138 patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Fever is typically the first symptom experienced by those infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, according to the study of patients in Wuhan. Some COVID-19 patients may also experience fatigue, muscle pain and a dry cough.By day five, this transitions into breathing difficulties, especially for the elderly or those with preexisting health conditions. The study found it took patients an average of seven days after running a fever before they were admitted to a hospital.By day eight, those with severe symptoms had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, which can be fatal. This is when fluid builds up in the lungs.Patients with worsening symptoms are typically admitted to the intensive care unit by day 10. These patients are probably experiencing more abdominal pain and loss of appetite than those with milder symptoms.On average, it took patients with COVID-19 roughly two and a half weeks to recover from the illness and be discharged from the hospital.According to CNN, as of March 19 there were 215,000 coronavirus cases globally. The death toll has surpassed 8,000.Countries such as Argentina, Canada and Taiwan as well as the European Union have shut their borders in order to slow the spread of the disease.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
