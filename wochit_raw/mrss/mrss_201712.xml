They found that the protein was able to travel to the normal mouse's brain, accumulating and beginning to cause damage. In just 12 months, the normal mouse had effectively 'contracted' Alzheimer's.Scientists suggest that as the blood-brain barrier weakens with age, more amyloid-beta may infiltrate the brain, and contribute to its deterioration.The findings indicate that future drugs might be able to halt the disease by targeting the toxic protein before it ever reaches the brain.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The effects of chemotherapy drugs has been well documented, but this is the first study to find a negative effect inherited by the next generation. Scientists believe the chemotherapy medication may be altering the genetic expression of inherited germ line cells.Male cancer patients did not pass on the same effect to their offspring, most likely because sperm constantly regenerates, while a woman has all her eggs at birth.

Conservation International plans to restore 70,000 acres of land cleared for grazing with 73 million trees, Fast Company reported.The trees will be planted in the "arc of deforestation" that stretches across the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, Par and Rondnia, as well as the Xingu watershed. The planting method is called muvuca, which is Portuguese for a small place with many people. The muvuca method involves spreading hundreds of native tree seeds of various species over deforested land. Natural selection then allows the most suited trees to grow and thrive in a much thicker density than plant-by-plant reforestation. Plant-by-plant techniques usually have a density of 160 plants per hectare, while with muvuca, the density is 2,500 species per hectare.

The majority, however, are from the U.S., numbering at least 30,000.The leaked documents detail how firms like Appleby help clients stash money and assets in offshore tax havens, to avoid paying high taxes.The expos comes from the same German newspaper that outed last year's Panama Papers, and reveals the secret dealings of numerous individuals and companies, including the Queen of England, and Facebook.The Queen's private estate had invested nearly 10 million pounds in a Cayman Islands fund, some of which had gone to a company accused of exploiting the poor.Facebook and Twitter, meanwhile, received investments that were traced to Russian state institutions.

Orange County health officials said nine people who visited the theme park in September came down with the disease, CNN reported.  Three other people in the Anaheim area also got sick, according to a spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care Agency. The 12 patients range in age from 52 to 94, according to the L.A. Times. The towers were shut down after Disney was notified by health officials on October 27 about increased Legionnaires' cases, according to CNN. Disney found two of its 18 cooling towers had elevated levels of Legionella bacteria, which were then treated and disinfected. Cooling towers supply cooled water for several uses such as refrigeration or air conditioning, but not for drinking water. Legionnaires disease is a severe lung infection caused by Legionella bacteria through exposure to contaminated water or mist. The source of the mist can be air conditioning units, showers or hot tubs. It is not contagious between humans. It is treated with antibiotics.

They warn this could see a threefold increase in earthquakes next year, from 6 in 2017 to 20 in 2018. "Next year we should see a significant increase in numbers of severe earthquakes," said University of Colorado researcher Dr. Roger Bilham. "So far we have only had about six severe earthquakes. We could easily have 20 a year starting in 2018."Bilham, along with Rebecca Bendick from the University of Montana, studied earthquakes of magnitude 7 and higher since 1900 and found five instances of seismic increases. Most of the greater earthquakes occurred near the equator.Scientists suspect this maybe because of small changes in the Earth's core, but exactly why earthquakes would respond to a slowing Earth is unknown.New Zealand seismology experts at the University of Otago said they don't support the findings, and that the research shouldn't inspire panic.

Net Neutrality is the principle of an open internet where Internet Service Providers (ISPs) give consumers access to all content without favoring some sources or blocking others, according to USA Today.  It also prohibits ISPs from throttling certain content over others.  In 2015, the FCC decided to regulate broadband service like a utility, similar to electricity and water, according to the New York Times. The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast argue against net neutrality saying government regulation reduces the incentives to improve service. Without net neutrality, the internet could become divided into two tiers: one with fast service and one without.Larger internet and media companies as well as the affluent will be able to pay for the high-speed lane, while everyone else will have to use the slow lane. The new rules would require ISPs to disclose any blocking, throttling and prioritization of content.States are also prohibited from enacting their own net neutrality laws that conflict with the new FCC rules, USA Today reported.

This means Google can access users' locations and their movements well beyond consumer privacy norms. After being contacted by Quartz, Google said cell tower addresses have been included in information sent to a system that manages push notifications and messages on Android phones for the past 11 months. According to a Google spokesperson, the data was not used or stored, and that the company was taking steps to stop the practice by the end of November. With user location data, cell towers could be used to triangulate location to around a quarter-mile radius, and even closer in urban areas where cell towers are closer together. Even though the information is encrypted when it is sent back to Google, a third party could still compromise the system. Since January, all Android devices, even with location services disabled, were sending cell-tower addresses to Google.

Snuppy would later live to age 10 before also succumbing to cancer, though not the same kind.When Snuppy was five years old, researchers collected his stem cells while also taking eggs from female dogs and taking out their nuclei.Using a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer, nuclei from the stem cells were transferred into the empty eggs, then stimulated into dividing  creating over 94 embryos.The embryos were implanted into surrogates, resulting in the birth of four live re-clones. Though one died from diarrhea days after the birth, the remaining three are now nine months old and still healthy.Researchers published their report in the journal Scientific Reports. They say they will closely monitor the puppies and measure virtually all aspects of their lives, including growth, metabolism, immune system, and disease development. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>The Ogallala aquifer is drying up</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Ogallala aquifer, the world’s largest source of groundwater, is shrinking due to overuse by farmers in eight U.S. states.The aquifer underlies parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming and South Dakota. There is no shared agreement between the states on how to use it.The Denver Post examined federal data on the aquifer and found that it had shrank at double the rate over the last 6 years, compared with the last sixty. The water loss has impacted those living in rural areas. One resident told the Denver Post that he doesn’t know if he’ll get water when he turns on a faucet.Many streams and rivers linked to the aquifer have dried up and more are expected to do so if nothing changes. Various species of fish, including the minnow and the catfish, are also disappearing.The Denver Post reports that even if farmers in 8 the states drastically reduced their pumping, it’d take centuries for the planet to renew the aquifer.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Bitcoin's history of being used to buy illicit materials from the dark web means regulators are watching and could crackdown any time, especially if it grows big enough to impact a nation's monetary policy.As an intangible asset, Bitcoins have previously been targeted by hackers, and may again fall victim to digital theft.Though the value bitcoin is volatile, at the moment, it's at an all-time high. But because the supply is limitless, there is a risk of collapse in value if demand should ever go down.Experts have likened the bitcoin craze to the dotcom bubble, Tulip Mania, and other economic bubbles  all of which burst eventually.If they're to be believed, Bitcoin's downward spiral is only a matter of time.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It hasn't gotten this close since 1974, and isn't expected to swing by again until 2093.Phaethon may be named after a Greek demigod who nearly destroyed Earth, but since the giant rock is in a relatively stable orbit, there is no threat of a catastrophic collision.Astronomers believe the asteroid to be the parent body for the annual Geminid meteor shower, which happens when Earth passes through Phaethon's debris field.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. 3200 Phaethon measurement, orbit2.

      <title>Origami inspired artificial muscle can lift 1,000 times its own weight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University have developed origami-inspired artificial muscles that can lift up to one thousand times their own weight. The devices could be used on next-generation soft robots, to be deployed within the body or outer space, the LA Times reported. The scientists wanted to make robots that were soft and compliant yet had strength similar to hard-bodied systems. The group used origami techniques to create muscle-like devices that could allow for limb flexibility without the need for hard parts. They made devices that could shorten, curl, twist or bend when compressed and sealed them in a polymer bag and filled them with air or other fluids. Vacuuming the air out then allowed for movement to grip, lift and twist objects. The team discovered the origami muscles could squeeze down to a then of their original size or lift up to a thousand times their own weight. Soft robotic limbs could be used in the future on small scales within the body or at large scales for outer space construction. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Soft robotic hand2. Soft robotic snake arm picking up a bottle3. The devices can squeeze down to a tenth of their original size or lift up to 1000 times their own weight4.
