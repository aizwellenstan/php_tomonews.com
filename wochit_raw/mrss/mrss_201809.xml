Soldiers are then seen breaking formation and scattering. Though the president escaped unscathed, seven members of the national guard were reportedly injured by the blast.According to Venezuela's Interior Minister Nestor Reverol, assailants used two DJI M600 drones, each carrying a kilogram of C4 explosives. One drone was set to detonate above Maduro, the other in front of him.The Venezuelan military electronically knocked one of the drones off-course and caused it to detonate away from the target area. The second drone ended up crashing into an apartment building two blocks away from the event.Six people were detained and later charged in connection with the attack after authorities examined materials and electronic devices in their possession.The Madura administration accused the far right of trying to kill him, alleging that they conspired with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and Venezuelans in Miami.Critics say no evidence has been presented to back the government's claims. According to the Times of London, some have even speculated the attack may have been staged to let the president take action against his opponents.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Gut bacteria is important as it breaks down food parts we can't normally digest. When this occurs, the bacteria creates "extra calories" for our body to digest, which results in a calorie boost.The study was conducted with 26 participants who were overweight and obese, and going through lifestyle changes.The participants were tracked for three months, during which they had to follow a low-calorie diet and were encouraged to walk 10,000 steps a day.The team of researchers collected fecal samples from the participants to find out which bacteria their body's digestive system contained.Purna Kashyap, a researcher involved in the study, explained to NPR that "people who lost at least 5 percent of their body weight had a different gut bacteria compared to those who did not lose 5 percent of their body weight."The bacteria Phascolarctobacterium had previously been associated with weight gain in a study involving obese rats.The Mayo researchers said their study suggests Phascolarctobacterium may increase the effects of lifestyle and dietary changes on weight loss.

Chan School of Public Health,  semen and blood samples were collected from 656 men seeking treatment at a fertility center with their partners. The men were also asked what the type of underwear they wore the last three months.Researchers found that while the subjects produced similar amounts of ejaculation fluid, boxer-wearers had 25% higher sperm concentration, 17% higher total sperm count, and better motility compared to those who wore jockeys or briefs.Brief wearers' blood had more follicle-stimulating hormones, which are released by the pituitary gland and associated with sperm production. This suggests the gland may have been boosting hormone production to compensate for lower sperm numbers.The Guardian reports that previous studies have found scrotal temperature to affect spermatogenesis, and that wearing loose-fitting underwear is better than tighter undergarments at keeping it cool.But while the new study shows a link between type of underwear and fertility, more research is needed to account for other factors and establish clear causality.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANFord Motor Credit filed more documents with the bankruptcy court last Friday claiming Reagor-Dykes Auto Group misrepresented sales-reporting data to Ford Credit. Ford claims this could be one of the largest floor-plan financing frauds in U.S. history, according to KCBD. Ford believes Reagor-Dykes was stretching out the time it was using to pay off vehicles it sold to customers. During a Ford Credit investigation, they discovered the auto group was selling vehicles on average of 55 days before reporting the car sales to Ford Credit. The documents also claims Reagor-Dykes fraudulently obtained double-flooring from Ford Credit, reported KCBD. Double-flooring is an illegal practice where a single vehicle is used as collateral for more than one loan. Ford Credit also says Reagor-Dykes secured inventory financing for vehicles it had already sold. By listing the vehicles as current inventory, Reagor-Dykes was then able to obtain additional financing. According to Ford, Reagor-Dykes "squandered more than $41 million on the current management's watch  through either their own fraud or gross mismanagement."  According to KCBD, Ford Credit filed the documents requesting the court appoint a trustee to recover and preserve assets for the liquidation of Reagor-Dykes and provide payment to creditors.

He contacted Museums Victoria, and further exploration revealed several more.The teeth belonged to the Great Narrow Jagged-Toothed Shark, which grew to over nine meters long  twice the size of a Great White.The prehistoric predator lived approximately 25 million years ago and are believed to have preyed on small whales and penguins.Shark skeletons are mostly made of cartilage, which doesn't fossilize well. Only single teeth and bits of vertebra are usually found, so multiple sets from a single shark is a rare find.Apart from the mega-shark, teeth from several Sixgill sharks were also uncovered, leading the team to believe a school of the bottom-feeding Sixgills may have feasted on the mega-shark's carcass.The fossilized teeth collection is with Museums Victoria, and will be on public display for six months.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The virus inside the clusters are also quick to replicate inside the membrane to form more virus particles.According to the study, the protective membrane protects the virus clusters from being noticed by the immune system.As the vesicles pass through the immune system and into the intestine, it quickly separates and infects one single cell with multiple viruses.In the study, scientists found that mice infected with clustered viruses became more ill compared to those that were infected with a single virus.The researchers noted as there are currently no vaccine to treat the vesicles, treatments to target the clusters, instead of individual virus particles, would need to be developed.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[A woman is making the plight of her 6-year-old son public as a warning to other parents after he contracted La Crosse encephalitis from a mosquito bite, reports USA Today.In a post on social media, LoriAnne Surrett talks about how Noah, her son, had to spend six weeks at the hospital to fight the virus.A person contracts La Crosse encephalitis when they are bitten by an infected mosquito. The virus can cause inflammation of the brain as fluids build up. According to the CDC, symptoms usually take up to one to two weeks to show up and may include fever and headaches. In more severe cases, symptoms may also include nausea, vomiting, even seizures. The CDC says the most effective way to reduce the chance of being infected with the virus is to use insect repellents which contain DEET, Picaridin or other similar ingredients.The CDC also says there is no specific treatment for La Crosse encephalitis as antibiotics arenâ€™t effective against the virus.However if the illness is severe, it may be treated with supportive therapy, IV fluids along with respiratory support, which is how Noah was treated.]]></description>

Researchers from the University of Birmingham found e-cigarette vapor disabled vital immune cells in the lungs and increased inflammation, the BBC reported. The small scale study was led by Professor David Thickett, and the results published in the online journal Thorax. The experiment used a mechanical procedure to mimic vaping, using lung tissue samples from eight non-smokers. Scientists found the vapor caused inflammation and negatively affected alveolar macrophages, cells that remove harmful dust particles, bacteria and allergens. Changes in the lung tissue occurred over 48 hours, however the group advise that further research is needed to understand long-term health complications from vaping. Thickett said while e-cigarettes may be safer than traditional cigarettes, they could still be harmful if used long-term. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Person vaping with an e-cigarette2.

When cell damage is detected by p53, it activates the LIF6 gene, which in turn produces a protein that pokes holes in the target mitochondria and causes it to die.This genetic resistance to cancer is not just seen in elephants. Smaller critters like naked mole rats and grey squirrels also have mechanisms that keep them tumor-free.By studying how these animals' genes work, scientists are hoping to figure out how to prevent or treat cancer in humans.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The 46-year-old, who some local media identified as Kay Longstaff, said, "I fell off the back of the Norwegian Star and I was in the water for 10 hours, so these wonderful guys rescued me," in an interview with Croatia's state television network HRT. According to the Washington Post, she declined to tell reporters how she fell off the cruise ship. The cruise company is expected to examine closed-circuit camera footage in order to determine the events leading up to the incident. The company said the woman went overboard as the ship was headed to Venice. The ship was stopped and a search mounted after crew realized someone had fallen overboard. Croatian navy and coast guard were also alerted. The navy used a PC-9 aircraft and a patrol boat. Kay was spotted around 9:40 p.m. in the sea and rescued five minutes later.

In the U.S., approximately 45 million people wear contacts. The study found around 15 to 20 percent of wearers don't dispose of their old lenses in waste containers, and instead flush them down toilets or sinks.    The study, presented at the National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society, estimates between 1.8 to 3.4 billion lenses get flushed per year, equaling 20 to 23 metric tons plastics waste. Because the contact lenses are made with stronger plastics, they do not break down when exposed to microbes while going through a sewage treatment plant.Researchers found that the old contacts instead become smaller pieces and are prevalent in wastewater sludge after sewage treatment.

      <title>Large magma reservoir discovered beneath Long Valley supervolcano</title>

Human beings have the tendency to eat a lot of salt because it makes food taste good, even though too much salt isn't good for the body, reports IEEE Spectrum.Nimesha Ranasinghe, assistant professor at the University of Maine and director of the Multisensory Interactive Media Lab, came up with the idea of using utensils such as chopsticks and soup bowls to transmit the salty flavor to the tongue.Ranasinghe said he experimented with the amplitude, the frequency and with the placement of electrodes on different utensils.He designed a pair of chopsticks with electrodes embedded in the tips of the chopstick which would send taste sensations to the tongue once turned on.Ranasinghe said recent research shows all the regions of the tongue can detect all five taste senses, reports IEEE Spectrum.He told Newsweek the technology would be able to simulate different flavors such as sourness, saltiness, and bitterness with around 70 percent accuracy.The scientist has also experimented with different objects such as flavor-enhancing water bottles, straws, spoons, and even an Internet-connected cocktail glass aka a "vocktail."He admits the technology is still in its beginning stages, however he has hope that " ... one day virtual flavors will burst onto the tongue â€¦ "RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the American Brain Tumor Association, glioblastomas are brain tumors that appear in astrocytes, star-shaped cells that make up the supportive tissue of the brain. Glioblastomas are highly malignant and reproduce rapidly, and are supported by a large network of blood vessels in the brain. They rarely spread to other parts of the body. They are usually found in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain, but can appear anywhere in the brain or spinal cord. According to Popular Science, symptoms can range from general neurologic symptoms, such as headaches or seizures, to specific areas of the brain, like speech difficulty, weakness on one side of the body, or double vision.Glioblastoma is normally diagnosed through brain imagery and then surgery. Treatment includes surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, then radiation and chemotherapy.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Glioblastoma tumor2. Cross section of glioblastoma tumor3.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe makers of the world's largest plane have recently unveiled exactly how it plans to deploy satellites into orbit.According to a Stratolaunch Systems press release, its planned lineup of launch vehicles includes the Pegasus rocket, two medium-lift rockets, and a space plane.The small-payload Pegasus XL has a 370-kilogram capacity for either single or triple configuration.The Medium Launch Vehicle, or MLV, has a capacity of 3,400 kilograms. A three-core variant called the MLV-Heavy is being developed to carry nearly twice as much.The reusable space plane, codenamed 'Black Ice', is presently just a design study. It's meant to carry cargo to and from Earth, though a follow-on variant will be crew-capable.Rather than blasting off a launchpad, the rockets will be tethered to a massive twin-fuselage carrier, which boasts a wingspan of 385 feet. Once the plane gets to an altitude of 35,000 feet, the rockets drop and blast off into orbit.So far, the main aircraft carrier has done a taxi test, but has yet to go up in the air. It will also need to be tested and fitted for the rockets.Assuming everything goes smoothly for Stratolaunch, the first Pegasus rocket is set to launch by 2020, followed by the MLV in 2022.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York has a proton accelerator, but no electron ring, while the Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Virginia has the electron accelerator, but will need a proton ring.The Department of Energy is currently building a $730 million facility for rare isotope beams and may not be able to fund the proposed collider until after 2020.

According to archeologists, a city flourished around the pyramid for five centuries, and at one point encompassed an area of 988 acres. Researchers have named the city "Shimao." The pyramid was built out of a loess hill, and had 11 steps tapering as they ascend. It was guarded by an inner and outer wall. According to the researchers, atop the pyramid "were extensive palaces built of rammed earth, with wooden pillars and roofing tiles, a gigantic water reservoir, and domestic remains related to daily life."

Heat energy moves from warmer to cooler places. When outside temperature is cooler, heat leaves the body. But when outside temperatures are higher, heat can't escape as well. In high humidity, the air is full of moisture, so sweat takes longer to evaporate.As the body tries to cool down, blood is sent to the surface of the skin in order to radiate off heat. This pulls water out of the bloodstream and puts them into the sweat glands.Because of dehydration, less blood is available to transport oxygen to the brain and other internal organs. Circulation is encumbered as well because the blood has less water.    If those conditions maintain and fluids are not replenished, there is a risk of heat exhaustion. If someone appears to be confused, or starts to show other neurological symptoms, that is a sign of heat stroke.  Young children and older people are at higher risk for heat-related illnesses. It's important to stay properly hydrated in hot, humid weather. Wear loose-fitting and lightweight clothing. If possible, avoid direct sunlight. Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated drinks, which are dehydrating.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Body losing heat in colder temperature, loosing less heat in hot, humid temperature2.
