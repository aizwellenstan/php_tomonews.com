Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe U.S. army is developing exoskeleton technology to make soldiers deployed out in the battlefield stronger and more resilient. The exoskeleton is being developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation with a license from Canada-based B-TEMIA, which first developed the technology to help people suffering from medical related mobility issues, according to Reuters. The battery-operated exoskeleton is worn over a soldier's pants and uses sensors, artificial intelligence and other technology to aid in natural movements. Modern U.S. soldiers are now deployed into war zones carrying anywhere from 90 to 140 pounds of critical gear, including body armor, night-vision goggles and advanced radios, while the recommended limit is only 50 pounds. The goal of the exoskeleton would be to lighten the load soldiers must carry, so when they arrive at the battlefield, they aren't excessively fatigued.  According to Reuters, Lockheed Martin said last Thursday it was awarded a two-year $6.9 million contract from the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center to research and develop the ONYX exoskeleton.Keith Maxwell, the exoskeleton technologies manager at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, told Reuters that each exoskeleton is expected to cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.

But Trump and the Republicans are now paving the way for oil exploration.The New York Times reports that in 2017, a provision to allow for drilling in the Arctic refuge was inserted into a tax bill that was approved by the Senate and signed into law by the President. The provision authorized two lease sales of drilling rights for 400,000 acres each.Drilling plans are overseen by officials committed to oil exploration. Opponents fear the process may not be impartial, especially with speedy and less rigorous environmental impact assessments.Environmentalists are also concerned that seismic testing and eventual drilling in the refuge could threaten wildlife, including crucial habitats for caribou and polar bears.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the New York Times, up to 100 foreign criminals and rejected asylum seekers living in Denmark who cannot be deported for legal reasons will be sent to a 17-acre island called Lindholm about three kilometers away from the mainland. Ferry services would allow the foreigners to leave the island. However, they would not operate around the clock and migrants would have to be back in the island before nightfall.Lindholm Island currently hosts a research center for contagious animal diseases.  The plan was developed between Denmark's conservative coalition government and the right-wing Danish People's Party, whose support the government needs to pass legislation. The Danish People's Party celebrated the plan by posting a video on Twitter showing a brown man dressed in generic Middle Eastern clothes being dumped on the island.The Danish government will invest US$115 million in migrant housing facilities in Lindholm Island, which are projected to open in 2021.The rising number of migrants coming from the Middle East has divided Denmark.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their work in harnessing the body's immune system to fight against cancer. Allison and Honjo established a link between immunotherapy and cancer treatment by identifying how the different cells interact with each other. According to the Conversation, Allison and Honjo were able to identify certain pathways, called "immune checkpoints," that actively stop immune cells from attacking cancerous tumors. These pathways inhibit the body's T-cellswhite blood cells that destroy infected cells and tumor cellsand prevent them from locating and attacking tumors. Allison and Honjo identified two separate proteins located on the surface of T-cells, CTLA-4 and PD-1, that interact with tumor cell proteins causing T-cells to not attack the tumor. Allison and Honjo's research led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies that block the regulatory pathways controlled by CTLA-4 and PD-1. These drugs attach to the CTLA-4 and PD-1 proteins and prevent them from turning off the T-cells. With some cancers, these new drugs have led to significant tumor regressions. The FDA has approved their use for several advanced cancers such as: metastatic melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer head and neck cancers and other tumors.   However, there can be significant risks as well. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause damaging inflammation in the skin, gut, heart, lungs and other vital organs. In addition, the long-term effects of the new drugs are also currently unknown.    RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. T cells being inhibited from attacking tumor2. CTLA-4 and PD-1 proteins one surface of T cell3.

Witnesses say he shouted 'Allahu Akbar' as he did so.Four anti-terror Operation Sentinelle soldiers patrolling the area exchanged fire with the suspect and wounded him in the arm.The gunman managed to get into a taxi, which took him to the Neudorf district near the Franco-German border, where he lived.He came across police after getting out of the taxi, resulting in another exchange of gunfire. But authorities eventually lost track of him, according to the New York Times.The suspect has since been identified as 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt, who had been convicted 27 times and was on a watchlist of potential terror threats.Among those killed by Chekatt were a Thai tourist and a local resident, while an Italian journalist was among those seriously wounded.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Brexit: What is the Irish backstop?</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANAn integral part of Brexit negotiations concerns the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  According to the BBC, last month, E.U. leaders approved a deal with the U.K. that includes an agreement on the Irish border, with both sides looking to avoid reintroducing border posts between the two areas. According to the Washington Post, the backstop is an insurance policy that would keep Britain in the E.U. customs union if no other agreement can be found to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  Because the U.K. and Ireland are currently both part of the E.U. single market and customs union, goods do not need to be inspected for customs and standards, so products and services can be traded on Ireland with few restrictions.However, after Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic could be in different customs and regulatory systems, which could mean hold ups for goods being checked at the border. The problem now is that both the U.K. and the E.U. have different opinions on what the backstop should contain. The E.U. had originally proposed that Northern Ireland stay in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market, and the E.U. VAT system. Britain on the other hand, is against having a separate status for Northern Ireland because it feels it would damage the union as a whole. If the two sides cannot come to a deal on the backstop, it could mean a no-deal Brexit. This in turn could mean there would be some type of hard border with heavy checks in place between Northern Ireland and the Republic.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Backstop is a provision to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland2. The U.K. and E.U. disagree on the terms of the backstop3. U.K. and E.U. versions of backstop4. A hard border could appear in the event of a no-deal BrexitVOICEOVER (in English): "According to the BBC, last month, E.U. leaders approved a deal with the U.K. that includes an agreement on the Irish border, with both sides looking to avoid reintroducing border posts between the two areas." "According to the Washington Post, the backstop is an insurance policy that would keep Britain in the E.U. customs union if no other agreement can be found to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland." "The problem now is that both the U.K. and the E.U. have different opinions on what the backstop should contain." "The E.U. had originally proposed that Northern Ireland stay in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the E.U. VAT system." "Britain on the other hand, is against having a separate status for Northern Ireland, because it feels it would damage the union as a whole."

It was created as part of a land reclamation plan that was scrapped over concerns it would dry out land around it and destroy an important site for migratory birds.However, silt from a dam used to create the Markermeer clouded the lake's waters, suffocating the algae that formed the base of its aquatic food chain.Dutch ngo Natuurmonumenten aimed to change that by silt to create five artificial islands. The five islands were built over a period of two-and-a-half years.Boskalis, the company that built the islands, dug a 1,200 meter trench on the main artificial island to allow silt to be drained by ocean currents to form marshy areas with fertile soil.According to a report by AFP and articles on Natuurmonumenten and Boskalis's websites, these areas are now home to birds such as sparrows, the greylag goose, the common tern and the night heron.An abundance of plankton in the water provides a guaranteed source of food for the birds.Experts have also counted 127 differents kinds of plants on the islands, most of them brought by windborne seeds.The main artificial island contains three wooden bird observatories, footbridges and unpaved roads and is open to the public.

According to Forbes, the Ocean Cleanup System 001 created by The Ocean Cleanup left San Francisco in September with an overall goal of cleaning up half of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years and a 90 percent reduction by 2040. System 001 is a 2,000 feet long floater, with a 10-foot deep skirt connected below. The floater is designed to stop plastics from flowing over the system, while the skirt traps particles from escaping underneath. It's made from HDPE plastic and is flexible enough to bend with the waves, but rigid enough to form a U-shaped barrier to trap floating plastics pollution, according to Fast Company. The design takes advantage of natural oceanic forces to retrieve and concentrate the plastic.According to project leaders, aside from 2 metric tons of discarded fishing nets, no significant amount of plastic has yet been removed.The problem appears to be the system is moving too slow. Plastic enters the system, but is only concentrated for a few days, which is not long enough for it to be harvested. The organization said another problem is the system creates waves, preventing some plastic from entering the device. According to the organizers, increasing the span of System 001 should increase the surface that will effectively catch wind and waves, adding force, and increasing the floater's speed. They plan to make the system 25 percent bigger by opening the floater around 197 to 230 feet.According to Forbes, the team will continue to work to find a solution and hope to launch a System 002 in early 2020.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANNew NASA research confirms that Saturn is losing its rings at a rate which researchers describe as a "worst-case-scenario." Phys.org reports that using observations made by Voyager 1 and 2 decades ago, scientists say the rings are being pulled into Saturn by gravity as a dusty rain of ice particles under the influence of the planet's magnetic field. According to James O'Donoghue of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, this 'ring rain' drains enough water every 30 minutes to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. According to scientists' estimates, the rings could be completely gone in 100 million years. Saturn's rings are mainly composed of chunks of water ice ranging in size from microscopic dust to boulders several yards in width.  Ring particles have several forces acting upon them. Saturn's gravity want to draw the particles towards the planet, while their orbital velocity wants to shoot them out towards space.  The tiny particles can also get electrically charged from the Sun or from plasma clouds.These charged particles can also feel the pull of Saturn's magnetic field, which curves inward toward the planet at Saturn's rings.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANClimate scientists are warning that a polar vortex could sweep across the U.S. east coast and unleash one of the harshest winters in years.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the polar vortex is an area of low pressure, cold air surrounding the north and south poles. The 'vortex' or counterclockwise flow of air keeps frigid air closer to the poles.But during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the vortex can often become less stable and expand. As a result, cold Arctic air is sent southward with the jet stream, causing severe winter weather.The Washington Post reports that vortex disruption has been associated with a phenomenon known as a sudden stratospheric warming event. During such an event, the prevailing winds decrease or change direction, and the layer warms. When this occurs, the vortex is displaced and sometimes splits apart.Based on American modeling systems, the disruption is projected to occur this month. The European system, however, delays it until early January.While it's difficult to predict which region will be struck first, University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado claims Eurasia will be hit first, based on model forecasts. This means the Lower 48 states are likely weeks away from feeling any effect.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of a polar vortex2. Depiction of arctic air sent southward3.

After being printed, the steak can go on to be cooked.In addition to the steak, the company has also developed a vegan chicken breast made from ingredients including lipids, fibers, minerals and vitamins that mimics the texture animal meat.Scionti, who founded Nova Meat, told architecture and design magazine Dezeen that it takes around 30 minutes to print a 100 gram of steak.In addition to creating an ethical meat alternative, Scionti hopes the vegan steaks will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock to make our planet more sustainable.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Sussex police say there have been 50 reported sightings in 24 hours.The New York Times reports that at least 800 flights were canceled, affecting over 100,000 passengers.

If accepted, the decision would be effective the following June.The decision comes after the IWC rejected Japan's proposal to resume commercial whaling at an annual meeting in Brazil in September. Although Japan has not technically practiced commercial whaling for 30 years, it has been hunting whales in the Antarctic Ocean for "scientific research" under the exception of an IWC rule.According to the BBC, Japanese whalers have caught between about 200 and 1,200 whales each year. They claim they are investigating stock levels to see whether the whales are endangered or not.If Japan leaves the IWC, the country can no longer continue to conduct "scientific" whaling expeditions in the Antarctic. However, the Japanese government plans to limit its whaling to its exclusive economic zone, which covers an area of over four million square kilometers, according to geography website World Atlas.Iceland and Norway are the only other countries in the world that authorize whaling. Both are members of the IWC.IWC members Denmark, Russia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the US allow indigenous or aboriginal subsistence whaling for a few native populations who hunt whales as part of their culture.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Business Insider, the prototype took 2-3 weeks to grow, with a small strip costing $50. According to Digital Trends, to grow the meat, Aleph Farms first isolates four types of animal cells from a living cow. These cells are then nourished in a growth medium to develop into a complex matrix that replicates muscle tissue.   According to co-founder and CEO Didier Toubia talking to Digital Trends, "this improved meat production method saves significant amounts of water and land, avoids animal welfare issues and antibiotics use." According to Toubia, they still need at least two more years of development before the meat is commercially available.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Lab-grown steak characteristics2.

      <title>Super Blood Wolf Moon to occur on January 20-21</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions or custom animation requests, contact tips@nextanimation.com.tw. Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANA rare lunar phenomenon called a Super Blood Wolf Moon eclipse will occur on the night of January 20-21. According to WCPO, a super blood wolf moon eclipse is actually three separate phenomena happening at the same time: a lunar eclipse, a super moon and a wolf moon. A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, casting the moon completely in the Earth's shadow and giving it a reddish, "bloody" glow. A supermoon occurs when the moon is within 90 percent of its closest possible distance to the Earth, which makes it look bigger in the sky.   The "wolf moon" refers to the first full moon of the year. This year's full moon will also occur at the same time as the lunar eclipse and a supermoon. According to EarthSky.org, the umbral lunar eclipse will last just over three-and-a-half hours with totality occurring for about an hour. This is when the moon sits in the shadow of our planet, causing the moon to have a reddish glow as a result of light scattering. The lunar event will be visible for all of North America, and parts of Europe and Africa. The Middle East and other parts of Africa will be able to see a partial eclipse. The eclipse will not be visible for East Asia or Australia. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Super blood wolf moon eclipse2. Lunar eclipse3. Supermoon and wolf moon4.

This resistance to high temperatures is especially useful during the rocket's re-entry to Earth.Elon Musk stated the new rocket would be ready for test flights by 2019. The company hopes to launch an unmanned flight to Mars in 2022, and a manned mission to the Red Planet as soon as 2024.SpaceX also plans to use the ship for other types of missions as well.

These minerals were found 6,000 meters beneath sea level near Japan's Minamitorishima Island in April 2018, according to a study published in the journal Nature.An estimated 16 million ton of rare minerals including yttrium, dysprosium, europium and terbium have been found in the deposit.These rare earth minerals are used in smartphones and electric cars as well as rechargeable batteries.It is rare for large amounts of minerals to be found in huge deposits, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Japan started looking for rare-earth minerals after a dispute with China, which is currently the largest exporter of rare earths minerals, according to a Reuters report.In 2014, China held back shipments of rare-earth minerals to Japan during a row over disputed islands between the two nations.At the same time, China cut back its export of rare-earth minerals and increased the price of the minerals to preserve its resources.After China, the largest amount of rare earth reserves are found in Vietnam, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and India, according to Statista 2018.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
