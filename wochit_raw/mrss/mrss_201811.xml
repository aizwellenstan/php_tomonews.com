      <title>How alcohol causes blackouts and affects memories</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANHere, we try to explain the science behind blackouts, and how excessive alcohol intake can affect the memory.Blood alcohol concentration refers to the amount of alcohol present in the bloodstream, measured by the weight of ethanol, in grams, per 100 milliliters of blood.Blackouts can occur when the alcohol level in the blood reaches 0.20, which on average is about four drinks for women, and five for men, according to a report from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. But to understand how this happens, we need to first look at memory consolidation.In the hippocampus, short-term memories are converted into long-term ones through the persistent strengthening of synapses, a process known as long-term potentiation.These synapses pass signals through neurotransmitters like glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid, or GABA. For a signal to fire, the receiving neuron must have a higher positive charge.Glutamate binds to neuroreceptors and opens it for positive ions, triggering signal firing. GABA, meanwhile, allows in negative ions, which momentarily blocks this action.Alcohol increases GABA activity, causing it to inhibit signals more often and longer than usual. This prolonged depressant effect impacts consolidation, preventing long-term storage of memories.Alcoholic blackouts may be fragmentary, in which memory loss is partial, or en bloc, in which stretches of time are completely missing from a person's memory.Complete blackouts occur around 0.30 BAC. By 0.35, individuals could go into a coma, and at 0.40, the concentration is lethal, typically killing half of all adults who reach it.If anything, the Kavanaugh case at least helps highlight the dangers of too much booze and though it shouldn't be an excuse for crappy behavior, it's not something to be taken lightly, either.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Scientists say a 1.5-degree Celsius increase should be new goal</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANClimate scientists are saying that limiting a global temperature rise to a 1.5-degree Celsius increase should be a new target goal.This comes after decades of scientists saying global temperatures must be kept below 2 degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic impacts. According to the BBC, scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, or IPCC, and government officials are meeting in Incheon to see what needs to be done in order to meet the new target. Part of the reason for the change is that small island and low-lying countries were worried that a 2-degree Celsius increase would still lead to their territories being inundated by rising sea levels. Leaked drafts from the IPCC meeting show that a 1.5-degree Celsius increase would have some major differences than a 2 degrees Celsius increase. Some main points are that 10 million fewer people would lose their homes from rising sea levels. Two million square kilometers of permafrost is saved over centuries. There would be a 50 percent reduction in people across the world experiencing water scarcity. The Arctic would only experience one sea-ice free summers in a century, and there would be a 50 percent reduction in species losing half their geographic range. Unfortunately, according to the leaked drafts, the world has already warmed by about one degree and at the current pace, the 1.5C limit would be surpassed by 2040.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Researchers find key to slowing aging process in mice</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers have discovered a natural product that can reduce the level of damaged cells in mice caused by aging. Scientists have found that aged mice treated with Fisetin, found in many fruits and vegetables, has significant positive effects on health and lifespan, according to a University of Minnesota Medical School press release.  As people get older, they accumulate damaged cells. As these cells reach a certain level of damage they go through a process known as cellular senescence, whereby they stop dividing. Younger people with healthier immune systems can clear out these damaged cells, but as people age, these cells aren't cleared as effectively. These damaged cells then begin to accumulate and cause low-level inflammation and release enzymes that degrade tissue. Researchers found that Fisetin reduced the level of damaged cells in older mice, and published their findings in the journal EBioMedicine. According to one of the study's authors Paul D. Robbins, "these results suggest that we can extend the period of health, termed healthspan, even towards the end of life."

As these cells reach a certain level of damage they go through cellular senescence, whereby they stop dividing. Older people can't clear these damaged cells out as effectively." "These damaged cells then begin to accumulate and cause low-level inflammation and release enzymes that degrade tissue." "Researchers found that Fisetin reduced the level of damaged cells in older mice, and published their findings in the journal EBioMedicine."

Wind turbines can alter local temperatures by increasing the mixing of air at and above the surface, Ars Technica reports.Researchers Lee Miller and David Keith from Harvard University used a high-resolution climate model of the United States to simulate what would happen if enough wind turbines were placed in the middle third of the country where the winds are highest to meet all current power needs. Their results showed the continental U.S. would get warmer by about 0.2 degrees Celsius on average, while the regions with the wind-turbines would warm by around 0.5 degrees Celsius. The study was published in the journal Joule. The study found that temperature fluctuations are greater at night and smaller during the day because surface warming and Sun driven convection are greater than the effect of the wind turbines. At night when the air is calmer, wind turbines mix warmer air down toward the cooling surface. An important point is that the wind turbines are not generating heat, rather they are moving existing heat around.   Greenhouse gases from fossil fuels on the other hand continually accumulate and last for centuries. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. U.S. power supplied by only wind and its effects on temperature2.

The vaccine was previously approved for people age 9 to 26.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 14 million Americans become infected with HPV every year.  According to an FDA press release, Gardasil 9 prevents certain cancers and diseases caused by nine HPV types. The vaccine protects against Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, which are responsible for a majority of HPV-related diseases.The FDA said it based its expansion on results from a study of 3,200 women age 27 to 45 that found Gardasil 9 was 88 percent effective in prevention of vulvar, vaginal and cervical precancerous lesions, cervical cancer and genital warts caused by the nine HPV types. The vaccine's effectiveness in men  was "inferred" from the data on women, in addition to a clinical trial of 150 men ages 27 to 45 who took a three-dose vaccination over a six-month period.

The Department of Homeland Security also came out saying it has no reason to doubt the companies' statements.A follow-up Bloomberg report points to 'new evidence' from a telecom company, where a similar microchip was found embedded in the Ethernet connector of servers sourced from Supermicro.Experts say hardware hacks are a legitimate concern, and are far more devastating and hard to detect than software-based incidents.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Science Daily reports that researchers from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel and Nanyang Technological Institute in Singapore modified E. coli to light up when exposed to toxins, using it as a sensing model representative of the complex gut microbial system.Exposure to six types of popular artificial sweeteners, which include aspartame and sucralose among others, had a toxic, stressing effect that made it difficult for the bacteria to grow and reproduce.A separate study carried out in Australia looked at 29 healthy adults and randomly administered the capsule equivalent of drinking 1.5 liters of diet soda a day to 14 of the participants. The other 15 were given a placebo, according to a report in Diabetologia.After two weeks, the amount of good bacteria in the 14 subjects' gut had decreased, while gut pathogens had increased  potentially affecting the body's ability to regulate glucose.But while both studies' findings are compelling, experts say they are insufficient to establish causality. It's also it's difficult to assess what exactly these gut marker changes mean to overall health.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of modified E. Coli bacteria luminescing when they detect toxicants2.

Brazilian butt lifts, or BBLs, involve taking excess fat from other parts of the body, such as the stomach and back, and injecting it into the glutes to enhance them.The procedure carries a large risk of fat cells being mistakenly injected into large veins and going into the bloodstream. This can lead to a fat embolism, which can block blood vessels in the heart, lungs or brain and cause death.Other complications that can stem from BBLs include bacterial infections, wound ruptures, and necrosis, among others.Experts say many patients who have suffered botched surgeries had the procedure done abroad where it's cheaper.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The catch-and-release method is common in recreational fishing, with most people opting to use barbless hooks to reduce the harm caused to the fish.According to a UC Riverside study, fishing hooks cause injuries to the mouth of fish which in turn affects their ability to capture prey.When the hook is removed, it leaves behind a hole in the mouth, according to the study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.Researchers explained the hole disrupts the suction feeding system, creating negative pressure in the mouth relative to the water as the fish open their mouths to suck in their prey.Scientists captured ten shiner perch using a hook and line and ten others using a net.The captured fish were observed using high-speed cameras. Those with mouth injuries were found to have difficulty sucking prey into their mouths.However, a researcher involved with the study said that further studies are needed to determine the long term effects of hook-related injuries on fish.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It will also house labs that can simulate various parts of Mars' environment. Researchers will practice several methods of farming on light resources as Mars lacks water and nutritious soil. Waste and water recycling methods will also be tested. With Mars radiation being stronger than on Earth, the domes will be used to test material that can block solar radiation.

According to a new study published on Wednesday in PLOS One by Utah State University researchers Paul Rogers, Ph.D. and Darren McAvoy, Ph.D., the Pando is in danger of collapse. According to Inverse, Pando is a massive grove of 47,000 genetically identical stems growing from a single underground root system of a quaking aspen tree that covers an area of 107 acres. According to Forbes, aspens have the ability to produce clones through offshoots from their root system and are able to colonize large areas of land through the root system. The new study found that the Pando has been declining in size for decades and has not been able to replace dying aspens. The scientists found that a combination of grazing animals, like mule deer and cattle, and human encroachment have led to the Pando collapse. The researchers found that protective fencing was effective at protecting the Pando. In order to survive long term, Rogers told the New York Times, that more thorough fencing would be required, along with culling some deer and making sure cattle don't graze in the grove.

He was dead within seven minutes, and dismembered within 22 minutes.Newly leaked footage now shows that the Saudis employed a body double to put on a fake beard and wear the deceased Khashoggi's clothes as part of a cover-up. Reports suggested that the body double, identified as 57-year-old Mustafa al-Madani, is an intelligence agent with similar height, age, and build to Khashoggi.  Madani was captured on camera walking the streets of Istanbul with an accomplice, but was recognized as an imposter due to having different shoes.Khashoggi's body, meanwhile, has yet to be found. Saudi officials claim they don't know the location of his remains, only saying it was rolled in a rug before being handed to a local accomplice.A pro-government Turkish newspaper reported that on the day of the killing, a member of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's entourage made four calls to his office and one to the U.S., adding to speculation that he ordered the act.Turkey supposedly has audio recordings and other evidence of Khashoggi's murder, but has yet to disclose them.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

CNN reports that on Monday, the USS Curtis Wilbur, a guided missile destroyer, and the USS Antietam, a guided missile cruiser, conducted a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait, to demonstrate 'U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific', according to the deputy spokesman of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.The two U.S. Navy warships reportedly sailed from south to north through the 110-mile waterway that separates Taiwan from China.U.S. Defense officials told CNN that multiple Chinese warships followed the vessels during the transit, but kept at a safe distance.America's show of force comes amidst an ongoing trade war with Beijing, as well as tensions between the two countries over China's militarization of the South China Sea.Late last month, a U.S. guided missile destroyer passing near the Spratlys had to maneuver to avoid colliding with a Chinese ship that came within 45 yards of its bow.China is unhappy with American support of Taiwan, in particular a $330 million arms sale package to the island nation.While the U.S. officially adheres to Beijing's 'One China Policy', the Trump administration has sought to forge closer ties with Taiwan.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to NPR, Bolton cited Russian violations as the reason to terminate the 1987 INF Treaty signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. According to CBS News, the U.S. claims Russia's 9M729 missile system violates the INF treaty. The system can operate at lower altitudes and reach targets across Europe and the U.S. west coast if launched from Siberia. The original treaty prohibited the U.S. and Russia from fielding ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, their launchers and associated support structures. According to Bolton, it is necessary for the U.S. to withdraw in order to adapt to a post-Cold War environment with several competing global powers.

According to Science News, visual neuroscientist Christopher Tyler of the City University of London looked at six pieces of art thought to be modeled after da Vinci, and published the results on October 18 in Jama Ophthalmology.According to the Washington Post, Tyler looked at two sculptures, two oil paintings and two drawings and conducted mathematical analyses to conclude that da Vinci had "an exotropic tendency of approximately -10.3 degrees when relaxed.Five of the works show an eye misalignment consistent with the eye disorder exotropia that can affect three-dimensional vision.

Exotropia is a type of strabismus where one eye turns slightly outward and can be treated with special glasses, eye patches or surgery.

This allows the bump to expand and sit out further, thus appearing bigger.The muscles recuperate during sleep, and become refreshed and better able to maintain the bump's position in the morning.Levels of the hormone relaxin, which causes abdominal muscle stretching during pregnancy, was also found to be highest at night, according to a study published in the Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides.Women's Health reports that pregnant bellies have also been known to "pop" seemingly overnight, which is caused by the uterus expanding due to the growing fetus, and rising above the pubic bone.
