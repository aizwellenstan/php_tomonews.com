It is designed to provide energy to port cities and offshore gas and oil-extracting platforms.The floating nuclear power plant will be towed from St. Petersburg and around Norway to a Russian town called Murmansk to take on nuclear fuel. From Murmansk, the $232 million nuclear plant will head to the Arctic to power the oil-industry town of Pevek.With two nuclear reactors, the nuclear plant will produce up to 70 MW[a] of electricity, enough to power a city of 100,000 inhabitants.Rosatom says the nuclear plant is designed with the great margin of safety that exceeds all possible threats and makes nuclear reactors 'invincible' for tsunamis and other natural disasters.Rosatom also added that the floating nuclear plant meets all the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency and do not pose any threats to the environment.Despite such reassurances, Greenpeace nuclear expert Jan Haverkamp told Engadget that having nuclear reactors moving around the Arctic Ocean creates a obvious threat to a fragile environment which is already affected by climate change.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Researchers in Japan looked at the medical records of 901 severe trauma patients who visited one of two emergency critical care centers in Japan from 2013 to 2016, according to the Telegraph. They found patients with type O blood had a death rate of 28 percent, while the death rate of patients from other blood groups combined was 11 percent. Lead researcher Dr. Waturu Takayama, from Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, said "recent studies suggest that blood type O could be a potential risk factor for hemorrhage." People with blood type O have lower levels of the blood clotting protein known as von Willebrand Factor, vWF. "Therefore, a lower vWF level is a possible explanation for the increase in mortality in patients with blood type O, as observed in this study," researchers wrote. Since the study was conducted only in Japan, researchers suggested looking at results over different populations, as different countries tend to have different blood type distributions.

If it does, Hawaii will become the first U.S. state to enact a law of this kind, which will take effect on January 1, 2021.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Before this, the earliest indicator of human activity in the country was a 67,000-year-old foot bone uncovered at Callao Cave.The ancients who hunted the rhino were likely an archaic human species called homo erectus that may have arrived from China via Taiwan, or from Borneo via Palawan.

The organization says nine out of 10 people everywhere are exposed to dangerous pollutants. According to the WHO, 34% of all pollution-related deaths are due to heart disease and 20% are from stroke. The rest consist of various lung-related conditions including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.Around 3.6 million deaths were connected to exposure from indoor air pollutants such as fumes from cooking fires and stoves. The most vulnerable are children under 5 where pneumonia is the biggest risk to life, women working in smoky kitchens and people who work outside.According to the WHO, outdoor air pollution in cities and rural settings is caused by industry and energy supply, transportation, waste management, dust, farming practices, and household energy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Still, clients were interested, so the company hired its first digital assets trader to handle the crypto-trading operations.Goldman could buy and sell actual Bitcoin in the future, but will need to secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve to do so. They will also need to find a way to securely guard the bitcoin, to avoid it being stolen by hackers, as has been the fate of many digital currency exchanges.Experts have noted that the move will likely lend legitimacy to virtual currency, and are wondering whether it will prompt other financial institutions to follow suits.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANMarine scientists have discovered over 100 new species in waters surrounding Bermuda. The Nekton project team used special equipment including submersibles, as well as technical divers and remotely operated vehicles. The depth region they looked at is known as the raritrophic zone.

According to Duke University researchers in a press release, large predator sightings such as alligators on the beach, killer whales in rivers and mountain lions in open fields are a sign that local populations have rebounded thanks to conservation efforts. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, found that alligators and sea otters were actually re-colonizing ecosystems that had been prime hunting grounds before humans decimated their populations. By collating data from other studies and government reports, Duke researchers found alligators, see otters, river otters, gray whales, gray wolves, mountain lions, orangutans and bald eagles populations were either as abundant or more abundant in "novel" habitats than in traditional ones. Rebounding numbers have shown that several large predators once thought to be highly habitat specific, are actually quite adaptable. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Tech Times, 50-year-old Carol Martin was misdiagnosed by doctors twice. It wasn't until her third visit to the hospital, after her condition had become serious, did physicians realize it was flesh-eating bacteria. According the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, necrotizing fasciitis is a serious bacterial infection that spreads quickly and kills the body's soft tissue. People with flesh-eating bacteria usually begin to display symptoms within a couple of hours after an injury. Symptoms may seem like another injury or illness. Some people complain of a pulled muscle like pain or soreness. The skin may also get warm and form red or purplish areas of inflammation that rapidly spread. Later symptoms can include fever, chills, fatigue and vomiting. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.    RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Bacteria killing soft tissue2.

The plane then turned northwest before dropping off the range of military radar.Crash investigator Larry Vance believes the captain depressurized the cabin at some point to disable passengers, which could explain the lack of any texts or emergency calls.Satellite data had picked up faint signals from the plane's engines, showing it could have flown either north toward Kazakhstan, or south to the Indian Ocean. Calculations indicated the latter.In searching for the missing plane, the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau worked under the assumption that it crashed into the ocean following an uncontrolled dive.Hardy believes the pilot was controlling the aircraft until the end. He would have easily pulled out of the death dive and flown longer before impact, which would put the crash site outside the current search area.While the experts present some compelling theories, the fact remains that four years on, the plane has yet to be found.Without solid evidence from the wreckage, there's no way to definitively unravel the mysteries surrounding MH370.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Our universe is believed to host very little of the substance. Scientists speculate large amounts of the theoretical substance creates dead universes.Researchers simulated the impact of several hundred times more dark energy and found it had only a modest impact on star and planet formation. The small amount of dark energy in our own universe, according to the researchers, may be due to an undiscovered law of nature.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of dark energy2.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANIn a study published in the journal Pediatrics, a Pennsylvania woman developed hypersensitivity pneumonitis, otherwise known as "wet lung", after using e-cigarettes.E-cigarettes work by heating liquid that turns into vapor, which the user then inhales and exhales, much like when one smokes a cigarette. The liquids usually contain flavorings, propylene glycol, glycerin and often nicotine. An 18-year-old Pennsylvania woman had only been vaping for three weeks when she developed symptoms so severe that she was sent to the emergency room of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, CNN reports.Dr. Casey Sommerfeld of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, who was part of the study, says chemicals in an e-cigarette may have triggered a patient's body to create an immune response, leading to lung damage and inflammation.Sommerfeld said the immune response in the patient led to increased inflammation and "leaky" blood vessels, which in turn can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs.The teenager exhibited symptoms of coughing, difficulty breathing that was quickly getting worse, and sudden stabbing pains in her chest every time she inhaled or exhaled.When her condition worsened and she went into respiratory failure, she required a mechanical ventilator to breathe for her, and required tubes inserted on both sides of her chest to drain fluid from her lungs.The woman's condition was diagnosed as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sometimes called "wet lung", which is an inflammation of the lungs due to an allergic reaction to chemicals or dust."After being treated with methylprednisolone, a drug used to treat severe allergic reactions, the woman's condition improved and she was taken off the mechanical support system five days after being admitted to the hospital, CNN reported.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The short audio clip originated on Vocabulary.com under the word "laurel," and was traced back to a Flowery Branch High School freshman in Georgia on May 11, who posted the audio clip to her Instagram story, Wired reported.The sound clip was then posted by YouTuber Cloe Feldman onto Twitter where it took off.A possible explanation why people are hearing different words is because the file is "acoustically ambiguous" or very poor-quality, according to Northwestern University neurobiology professor Nina Kraus. The clip that went viral had already been re-recorded several times, meaning there were multiple steps that degraded the quality of the audio.   According to Brad Story, professor of speech, language and hearing sciences at the University of Arizona, the two words also have similar sound patterns. This combined with the low quality of the sound file could account for the different things people hear. The pitch of the clip can also affect what is heard.

It's currently scheduled for a December 2018 launch.Queqiao is also equipped with the Netherlands-China Low-Frequency Explorer, a radio scanner that will search for ancient radio signals dating back to the formation of the early universe.The reason the satellite is able to do this is because it would be in the "shadow" of the moon, completely unaffected by Earth's interference.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Fukushima's nuclear storage tanks are almost full</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions or custom animation requests, contact tips@nextanimation.com.tw. Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANWater containing radioactive byproducts have almost filled up the storage tanks at the the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant in Japan.According to Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun, the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant reactor that suffered meltdowns during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami may end up contaminating groundwater. The reactor produces about 160 tons of radioactive water per day. The filters that remove radioactive elements from water are not able to remove an element called tritium, thus resulting in the amount of water containing only tritium to steadily increase.The storage tanks at Fukushima have a capacity of about 1.13 million tons, with about 1.07 million tons of that capacity already filled. Of the space used, 80 percent is occupied by treated water containing tritium.The area the tanks occupy totals about 230,000 square meters, which is the equivalent of about 32 soccer fields, and there is almost no more expansion space left to allow for more storage.Officials reportedly have been trying to increase storage capacity by building bigger tanks when it's time to replace the current ones. However, a senior official of Japan's' Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry said this storage method is already close to capacity. Tokyo Electric Power Company is planning to secure 1.37 million tons of storage capacity by the end of 2020, but has yet to decide on what to do after 2021. Regarding the treated water, TEPCO's chief decommissioning officer Akira Ono said that it is impossible to keep storing it forever. The Japan News reports that tritium is produced during regular nuclear plant operations, but also exists in nature. An average of 380 trillion becquerels of treated water containing tritium was released annually into the ocean in the five years before the nuclear plant disaster.Yomiuri Shimbun reports that the treated water containing tritium at Fukushima measures up to more than 1 million becquerels per liter. This is more than 10 times the national standard allowed for release into the ocean, which is 60,000 becquerels per liter. However, if the water is diluted, it can be released into the sea.The Japan News reports that a 2016 report by the industry ministry's working group said there are five ways to deal with treated water: releasing it into the sea, evaporation, releasing it after electrolysis, underground burial, or injection into geological layers. Out the five options, releasing it into the sea was seemed as the cheapest and the quickest way to dispose of the water.An expert committee organized by the ministry says it plans to to hold a public hearing in Fukushima Prefecture and other places to allow local residents to voice their opinions on what to do with the radioactive water.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the study published on May 17 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the diarrhea-causing strain of E. coli secretes a protein that attaches to sugar molecules on type A blood cells, but not type B or O cells. According to Science News, researchers from Washington University School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins University also found these sugar molecules are also present in the gut linings of people with blood type A. Scientists had 106 healthy volunteers drink water laced with a strain of E. coli extracted from a person in Bangladesh with severe diarrhea. After five days, 81 percent of the type A or AB volunteers developed moderate to severe diarrhea compared to about half with blood types O or B. The results could mean that a vaccine targeting the bacterial protein could be effective. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Blood type A person being infected by E. coli strain2.

According to the federation, the incident took place at the grand final of Australia's A league between Melbourne Victory and Newcastle Jets earlier this month. When Victory was delivering the ball from a free-kick play, the software that VAR system provider Hawk-eye uses crashed, causing the cameras to partially lose 30 seconds of footage.During the glitch, three players in the Victory's outfit were already standing in offside position, and the referees did not signal offside either. This failure allowed Victory's players to take the chance at controlling the ball, which later led to the controversial goal that helped the team clinch the league title.Greg O'Rourke, the head of Australia's A-League said the technology failed on this occasion and the broadcast angles required were unavailable. They are working with Hawk-Eye's UK head office to prevent this from happening again.Hawk-Eye's Australian branch declined to comment on the glitch, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.VAR was introduced as a technology-based solution to correct human referees' errors when they need to make a decision in just split seconds.Last month, FIFA announced that Hawk-Eye will be the VAR system provider and will feature its camera prominently in all the FIFA World Cup fixtures in Russia this summer.

They can grow up to a meter long and appear to reproduce asexually.Citizen sightings indicate that at least three hammerhead species have been in metropolitan France as early as 1999, with two others reported in overseas territories.The invasive species feed on earthworms in the soil, which they immobilize by secreting small amounts of the paralytic poison tetrodotoxin   the same neurotoxin found in the potentially lethal Japanese delicacy fugu or puffer fish.Since earthworms help aerate soil and keep it fertile, scientists worry that the presence of predatory flatworms may threaten biodiversity and drastically affect the ecosystem.They believe the worms were likely transported to Europe via tropical plants, but remain baffled by how they went undetected for almost 20 years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Sharks, dolphins, and sea lions often get tangled in the net and are unable to free themselves, leading to death or serious injury.Drift net fishermen claim the industry has implemented measures to reduce bycatch, including using nets with larger openings and electronic devices to scare off dolphins.Still, opponents say the casualties are unnecessary and unacceptable, believing that phasing them out is the best way to stop the horror.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Coral bleaching has left only 1% of Japan's biggest reef healthy</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANRising sea temperatures have impacted the ability of Japan's biggest coral reef to recover from bleaching, resulting in only one percent of the reef being in good health, according to a new study. Bleaching can occur due to changing environmental conditions such as rising sea temperatures and causes coral to expel tiny photosynthetic algae which drains them of their color. Since the 1980s, the volume of coral in Sekisei Lagoon near Okinawa has plummeted by nearly 80 percent. The coral has been damaged by starfish eating coral and rising ocean temperatures, according to Japan Today.The latest study shows that the corals haven't recovered much since 2008 due to the 1998, 2001, 2007, and 2016 bleaching events. The lagoon itself is around 67.89 square kilometers with only around 1.4% of its corals still healthy. Coral reefs are home to 25% of marine life even though they only make up one percent of the marine environment.The only way the corals would be able to recover is if the temperature in the ocean drops and algaes are able to colonise them again, reports AFP.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

When the sun's path is at 29 degrees north of due west, it aligns with streets on the grid.The setting sun can be seen simultaneously on all streets heading east and west. It's an unusual event that happens four times a year in May and July, twice with a half sun and twice with the entire disk visible.This year, Manhattanhenge went down around Memorial day, on May 29 and 30, and will be seen again on July 12 and 13.Experts say the sunset alignment isn't just limited to NYC.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANNew research has found that cockroach milk is highly nutritious, and could even feed future generations.The Washington Post reports that unlike most insect species, the Pacific beetle cockroach is viviparous. This means it gives birth to live offspring instead of eggs,which it nourishes with a yellow, liquid substance from her brood sac.Instead of simply being digested, the liquid milk is deposited in the embryo's midguts and forms into tiny crystals. Analyses revealed the crystalline milk is a complete food containing proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, and with three times more energy than buffalo milk.But despite being touted as one of the most nutritious substances on the planet, it's unclear whether no telling roach milk is safe for human consumption. To work around this, scientists are now reverse bioengineering the milk and working on using yeast to produce the beetle roach crystals in larger quantities.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
