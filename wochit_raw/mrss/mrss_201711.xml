      <title>Catalonia's referendum for independence, explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEOn October 1, 2017, Catalonia voted for independence, despite opposition from the central Spanish government.The northeast region of Catalonia is one of Spain's 17 autonomous communities. It's home to 7.5 million people, and has its own distinct language, history, and culture, according to the bBC.Catalonia was once under the kingdom of Aragon, which unified with Castile in the 15th century. It remained a state until it was defeated in the 1714 Siege of Barcelona, and its sovereignty was abolished. Under the newly centralized Spanish realm, Catalans were forced to adopt the Castilian language and customs.The region regained autonomy when Spain became a republic in 1931, but lost it again during the Franco dictatorship. Franco's death restored democracy, allowing Catalonia to have its own Parliament, police force, and education system.Though they have a high degree of autonomy, Catalans are not satisfied with the central government.As Spain's wealthiest region, it generates 20% of the national GDP. But high budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis, and complaints of paying more taxes than they get back have increased separatist sentiment.The Brookings Institute reports that in 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reversed a 2006 ruling that granted the region 'nation' status and its own tax system, angering many and fueling the movement for independence.This movement culminated in the October 1 referendum, which Madrid has called illegal.A Catalonian secession would impact the Spanish economy, but also see the region out of the EU. With no free trade, the region's economy could shrink, and the unemployment rate could double.But do all Catalans want independence? Polls taken before the referendum showed that while 70% wanted the right to vote, only 41% sought independence.Still, Madrid's response was aggressive. It arrested Catalan leaders, and took down websites and apps in an effort to thwart the vote.On the day of the referendum, violence erupted as police seized ballots, and forcibly stopped people from voting. Despite the danger, voter turnout was at 42.3%, with nearly 90% of those who voted backing secession.Catalan's president has said he will declare independence within 48 hours if the 'yes' side won. If this happens, Spain will enter a constitutional crisis and may be forced to suspend Catalonia's autonomy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>What are the different type of volcanoes?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEA volcano is an opening in the earth's surface where molten rock can escape. The earth's crust is made up of tectonic plates that shift and move. Volcanoes are often located at the fault lines between these plates. Volcanoes can be active, dormant or extinct, according to Universe Today. There are four major types of volcanoes: cinder cone, composite, shield and lava domes.Cinder cone volcanoes occur when lava is ejected from a volcanic vent. Lava is shot into the air, and pieces accumulate around the vent. Over time, this creates a circular or oval-shaped cone, with a crater at the top. Composite volcanoes contain a conduit system that channels magma to the surface. These volcanoes can have clusters of vents along the sides of the mountain where lava flows out. Shield volcanoes are large, broad volcanoes where lava pours out in thin layers, allowing it to travel farther down the shallow slopes of the volcano. Shield volcanoes build up slowly with hundreds of eruptions creating several layers. Lava domes are created when small masses of thick lava that can't flow far from the source, so domes pile up around the vent. The dome grows by expansion of lava from within, and the mountain forms from material spilling off the sides of the dome.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cinder cone volcano2. Composite volcano 3. Shield volcano4.

By contrast, those given a placebo reported a slight increase in bone loss.According to lead investigator Philip Conaghan of the University of Leeds, the drug has very few side effects, and is reportedly the first to target the diseased bone structure, instead of simply managing pain like most existing treatments.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Much of the world's honey now has pesticides</title>

"On the global scale, the contamination is really striking," said study coauthor Edward Mitchell, a soil biologist at the University of Neuchtel in Switzerland.Around 200 samples of honey were tested and 75 percent found to contain measurable levels of at least one of the five common neonicotinoids, Science News reported. Neonicotinoids are used on various crops grown in different climates, but still showed up in honey from remote islands with almost no agriculture. The insecticide works by targeting crop-destroying insect's central nervous system. A number of studies have found the insecticide also reduces and weakens honeybee hives. Pesticide levels varied from region-to-region. In North America, 86 percent of samples contained pesticides; Asia, 80 percent; Europe, 79 percent; Africa, 73 percent; the Australian region, 71 percent and South America, 57 percent. Bees and other pollinators are necessary to three-quarters of the world's food crops, but have been declining in number in recent decades, the Guardian reported. Destruction of wild habitats, disease and massive pesticide use are all contributing factors. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Farmers spraying insecticide with honeybees around2.

A team from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory analyzed data from 2002 to 2009 by Mars Odyssey's Neutron Spectrometer (MONS), Science News reported. The neutron spectrometer can't directly detect water, but by measuring neutrons, it can detect hydrogen signature, which could mark the presence of water or other hydrogen-bearing substances, according to Space.com.  Researchers discovered an unexpected amount of hydrogen around the equator by reducing the blurring or "noise" in data using image-reconstruction techniques used for other spacecraft and for medicine, Space.com reported. This improved the spatial resolution of the images to 180 miles (290 km), from the previous resolution of 320 miles (520 km). More research needs to be done to determine if the signature is actual that from water ice.

      <title>Dimming of star probably caused by dust, not alien structure: NASA</title>
      <description><![CDATA[New research from NASA may have solved one of the most prevalent astronomy puzzles in recent years.Dyson spheres are theoretical cosmic megastructures. They envelop a planet with energy-absorbing technology which directs power to a central location.Some astronomers previously theorized the dimming of Tabby’s Star was caused by this. This star is located 1,280 light years from Earth.New research using data from NASA’s Spitzer and Swift space telescopes suggests the dimming is actually due to an dust cloud orbiting the star.Known as circumstellar dust, NASA says these particles are not small enough to fly into space, but also not big enough to block light all the time on all wavelengths.]]></description>

Most AIDS treatments are engineered to block this replication cycle, effectively stopping the spread of the virus.But though these drugs allow patients to live longer, they do not rid the body of the virus, which hides in reservoirs and re-emerges once treatment stops.A new 'kick and kill' approach aims to get rid of these reservoirs by using a synthetic molecule called SUW133 to wake up the dormant virus, which will then be eliminated by antiretroviral therapy.The technique was developed by researchers from UCLA, Stanford, and the National Institutes of Health, and is detailed in a study published in PLOS Pathogens.When tested on HIV-infected mice that had been given antiretroviral drugs, 25 percent of the once-dormant virus cells died within 24 hours of being reactivated.With further development, researchers believe the technique could lower the viral reservoir enough for infected patients to stop antiretroviral treatment.The molecule will also need to be tested on larger animals before it can go to human trials.

Sharks aren't naturally buoyant, so the infected ones sink to the bottom of the ocean once they stop swimming.Leopard sharks are the most commonly spotted victims of the parasite, but it's a lesser concern for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, since the species is not endangered.Scientists fear, however, that other species are also becoming infected and dying, but just aren't washing up on shore. They also worry that the parasite could spread farther along the California coast.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Dead shark, marine creatures along San Francisco bay2.

According to Business Insider, Uber does not mention the backdoor is any consumer-facing information included with their app. Apple's backdoor is so powerful, it rarely allows third-party companies to access the feature. Security researcher Will Strafach discovered the situation and told Business Insider, "granting such a sensitive entitlement to a third-party is unprecedented as far as I can tell, no other app developers have been able to convince Apple to grant them entitlements they've needed to let their apps utilize certain privileged system functionality." There's no evidence that Uber used the special iPhone feature. Uber told Business Insider the code was not being used and was a leftover from an earlier version of its Apple Watch app. A majority of iPhone apps use software to enable features like the camera or ApplePay known as "entitlements." Many of these can be easily turned on by outside app creators. But certain entitlements are only used by Apple to allow optimal integration with the iPhone.   Uber's app was found to be the only app other than Apple's own apps granted access to the entitlement, Strafach said in an email to Business Insider.Uber says the entitlement isn't being used, and it is working with Apple to remove the API completely from the app.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This year a large number of the cases are pneumonic plague, which targets the lungs and is passed on by coughing, according to the BBC. It is the most deadly form of the disease and can cause death within 24 hours.  The WHO has delivered more than a million doses of antibiotics to help combat the spread of the disease, according to BBC.

Dozens of treatment facilities across the country use Bio-Bead plastic pellets to filter chemical and organic contaminants out from sewage, the study from the Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition (CPPC) said, the Guardian reported. The study found several millions of the 3.5 mm wide pellets had been spilled into the surrounding seas.The Bio-Bead system is used by at least 55 sewage plants around the U.K., according to the CPPC. Bio-Beads are used in the last step of the sewage treatment process before treated effluent water is discharged back into rivers or the sea. The CPPC found no systems are currently in place at sewage plants to handle Bio-Bead spills. Plastic microbeads and industrial pellets, like Bio-Beads, are often mistaken for food by fish, birds and other marine wildlife. The plastic kills animals by blocking the digestive tract, but also as a result of exposure to chemical pollutants like DDT and PCBs that attach to the plastic beads in seawater. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Arizona State University researchers analyzed minerals in ancient fossilized ash from the most recent mega-eruption and believe the supervolcano became active after two injections of magma into the reservoir underneath the caldera, National Geographic reported. They found the minerals showed that the critical changes in temperature and composition built up over a few decades. Geologists previously thought it took centuries for supervolcanoes to go active.  Supervolcanoes have an eruption magnitude of 8 on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI) and spit out more than 1,000 cubic kilometers (240 cubic miles) of hot rock and ash, according to Science Alert.

      <title>Iceland opens world's first 'negative emissions' power plant</title>

The geothermal plant in cooperation with Climeworks will remove an estimated 50 metric tons of CO2 from the air each year where it will be turned into limestone and stored in the ground, Quartz reported.The process works by pulling CO2 from the ambient air using a special filter. The heat from the power plant warms up the filter which extracts pure carbon dioxide. The gas is then combined with water and pumped 700 meters underground. When the carbon dioxide reaches with basaltic rock, it forms minerals. The project is still in the pilot phase, but researchers at Climeworks believe negative emissions plants could be set up around the world. One major obstacle in place is the price. Climeworks estimates it runs around $600 to extract one ton of carbon dioxide from the air. However if economies of scale can be utilized and more plants open up, that price would drop significantly.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Geothermal plant in Iceland2.

Crows are highly intelligent and are able to make and use tools. Cigarette butts are the most littered item on the planet with an estimated 4.5 trillion butts thrown away each year, according to Inhabitat. The startup Crowded Cities plans to use the crows to help rid the streets of cigarette butts by teaching them to swap butts for food. The CrowBar is a device with a large funnel for cigarette butts and a peanut dispenser. It works by training crows using a four-step process. The first step presents food next to a cigarette butt, training the birds to expect food from the machine. Second, the machine only gives out food when the crow arrives at the device, teaching the crow how the machine functions.Third, the device only presents a cigarette butt with no food. The crow then starts to look for the food and in the process, knocks the butt into the funnel, dispensing the food. The fourth step involves removing the cigarette butt, but leaving them scattered around the CrowBar. The crow will then start to pick up butts they find and bring them back to the machine. Crowded Cities is currently in the process of putting together a working prototype, Popular Mechanics reported. The next step for researchers will be to study how collecting toxic cigarette butts affects the crows. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Crows using the CrowBar in city park2.

Building an actual wall would have to overcome environmental issues, and deal with the abundance of privately owned land along the border, Webb County Sheriff Martin Cuellar said, the Dallas News reported. Cuellar says the wall would also have an adverse effect on Mexican shoppers traveling between both countries and could potentially hurt Texas' economy. The sheriff has been looking for $92 million in funding over five years for a virtual wall that uses technology and agents on the ground as an alternative to a physical wall, according to the Dallas News. His proposed virtual wall would extend around 300 miles from Starr County to Del Rio. Cost estimates for Trump's border wall range from $21 billion to $40 billion.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Several recalled full conversations, and saw things happening around them- details which were verified by staff present at the time.Theoretically, this could mean the recently deceased are fully aware of their condition, and may even hear the pronouncement of their own death.The study suggests the awareness may be a result of a burst of energy that is released in the brain immediately post-mortem.This finding has been echoed in a 2013 research from the University of Michigan, which observed brain patterns pointing to a 'hyper-alerted state' in nine clinically dead rats.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This will make the LAPD the largest US police force to use the robotic aerial drones. Only SWAT team members in high-risk situations will be able to fly the drones. They will be deployed for aerial searches and gathering intelligence in tense situations. The drones will also be used in search and rescue missions. Every flight needs to be approved, documented and reviewed, according to Engadget. The Police Commission will receive quarterly reports that will be made public, the Los Angeles Times reported. Weapons and facial-recognition technology are prohibited. LAPD officials have attempted to address privacy concerns by saying the restrictions in place along with strong oversight would be sufficient, although many critics still remain wary. The commission will evaluate the performance of the pilot program after a year in order to decide whether to continue or not. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Police drone flying in representational space2.

Last Thursday, the state issued a conditional utility permit to allow Musk's Boring Co. to dig a 10.3-mile tunnel between the state-owned section of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, between the Baltimore city line and Maryland 175 in Hanover, according to the Baltimore Sun. The Boring Co. wants to construct two 35-mile tunnels between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., according to Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn, reported the Baltimore Sun.The U.S. government owns roughly two-thirds of the land Musk's company plans to dig underneath, Ars Technica reported. The 10-mile section approved by Maryland will be the first section of the underground system.   Once completed, the hyperloop trip between Washington and New York would only take 29 minutes. The Boring Co. looks to reduce traffic congestion by creating a low-cost system of tunnels.

Episodes seemed to be triggered without warning, although stress would often intensify the bleeding.  She was eventually diagnosed with blood sweating, or hematohidrosis. This condition causes blood to seep out of unbroken skin like normal perspiration.It's most common on the face, ears, nose and eyes and is often associated with fear and emotional stress, according to the National Institutes of Health Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, Time reported.

The analysis revealed that all the women had mutations affecting the cancer-guarding p53 gene, and had lost chromosomes containing one or both BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor-suppressing genes.They tracked the source of the mutations to the fallopian tubes, where the cancer developed and eventually migrated to the ovaries over a 6.5-year period. Once in the ovaries, the cancer progressed more rapidly, metastasizing within two years.The team's findings will need to be further validated by additional studies, but the results provide a glimmer of hope.With such a large window from fallopian tube to ovarian cancer, scientists believe new methods should be developed to detect and treat the cancer while it's still localized in the tubes.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The goal of the program is to "forge a public opinion environment where keeping trust is glorious. It will strengthen sincerity in government affairs, commercial sincerity, social sincerity and the construction of judicial credibility," according to the Chinese government, Wired reported. Participation currently remains voluntary, but by 2020, it will be mandatory. The Chinese Communist Party has given out eight licenses to private companies to develop systems and algorithms for a social credit score system. The two biggest projects are run by China Rapid Finance and Sesame Credit. Sesame Credit, for example, gives individuals a score between 350 and 950 points based on a private algorithm calculated from five factors: credit history, contract obligation fulfillment, personal characteristics, behavior and preferences and interpersonal relationships.Once the system becomes mandatory, people with low scores could be punished with slower internet speeds, be denied access to certain restaurants, night clubs or golf courses and restricted from traveling. Scores will also affect an individual's rental applications, ability to secure insurance or a loan, as well as social security benefits. Citizens with low scores will be forbidden from certain jobs and from applying to better schools.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Subway riders each with a social credit score2.

It's also difficult to engineer antibodies that can be effective against the multiple strains of HIV, which frequently mutate.Using a synthetic chemistry method, scientists have now designed a vaccine combining a gp120 fragment and a sugar molecule, and tested it on HIV-infected rabbits.The vaccine prompted the rabbits' immune systems to produce antibodies that physically bound to gp120 found in four dominant HIV strains.It takes roughly two years to build immunity against HIV, so despite sticking to the virus, the antibodies weren't able to prevent further infection.But the vaccine's ability to induce a strong immune response in a short amount of time is encouraging, and researchers believe further studies can produce a vaccine that can ultimately neutralize the deadly virus.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
