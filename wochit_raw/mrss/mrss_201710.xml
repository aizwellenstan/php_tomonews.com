      <title>How are hurricanes categorized?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEAs Irma makes its way towards the eastern U.S., it has now been upgraded from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane. Hurricanes are classified into five categories using the Saffir-Simpson scale, with the highest number representing the most powerful storm. Hurricanes are categorized based on wind speed. The wind speed is measured from an unobstructed area at a point 33 feet (10 meters) above the ground for one minute, according to the National Hurricane Center. The higher the category, the stronger the winds, and the more damage to be expected. Storms moving less than 38 mph are classified as a tropical depression, while those moving between 39 to 73 mph are considered tropical storms. In a Category 1 hurricane, wind speeds blow between 74 to 95 mph. Downed power lines, broken tree limbs, and minor home damage can be expected. With a Category 2 hurricane, wind speeds are between 96 to 110 mph. There can be "extensive damage" to houses and trees, while power outages can last for days or weeks. A Category 3 has wind speeds from 111 to 129 mph and the potential to cause "devastating damage" to roof decking and gable ends. In a Category 4 hurricane, wind speeds range from 130 to 156 mph and have the ability to cause "catastrophic damage," with the possibility of leaving areas uninhabitable for weeks to months. The last is a Category 5, which has wind speeds of 157 mph and over. During a Category 5, there's a "high percentage" that a home can be totally destroyed.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Japan planning for possible evacuation of 60,000 from South Korea</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEJapan has started planning for a possible evacuation of the 60,000 Japanese citizens currently living in or visiting South Korea as tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to rise. There are currently around 38,000 Japanese living in South Korea, while about 19,000 are tourists or short-term visitors, the Nikkei Asian Review reported. Tokyo is proposing four contingency plans: limit nonessential travel to South Korea, discourage all travel to South Korea, advise all Japanese to evacuate and encourage them to take shelter in place, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.In the event of smaller military skirmishes between the Koreas, Tokyo would discourage all travel to South Korea, while concurrently urging citizens to leave using commercial aircraft.   During a shelter in place scenario, Japan would need to work with Seoul. For example, if South Korean airports were taken out, the Japanese embassy would advise citizens to stay in place or seek safer shelter further south. South Korea has agreed to give Japanese in the country access to safes zones, such as designated subway stations, churches and shopping centers, a source told the Nikkei Asian Review. Tokyo has provided its citizens with over 900 such facilities. In the event flying is not an option, Japanese citizens could return by sea from the port city of Busan. Japan is currently in talks with the U.S. to have American forces transport evacuees to Busan.   In response to Pyongyang's sixth nuclear test, Japan and the U.S. are looking to increase economic pressure on North Korea through an oil embargo and other measures.    RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The company said $100,000 was spent on around 3,000 ads over a two-year period that ended in May 2017, the BBC reported. The advertisements did not support any particular candidate, but focused on immigration, race and equal rights. The ads directed people to 470 accounts that were spreading false news or were in breach of company policies, Facebook said in a blog post.The accounts have all been shut down, according to Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer. Facebook believes, though it cannot verify, that the accounts in question belonged to the Internet Research Agency, a pro-Russian group based in St. Petersburg. The campaign was discovered as part of Facebook's internal investigation after it was criticized for allowing the spread of fake news on the site in the lead up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election."We looked for ads that might have originated in Russia, even those with very weak signals of a connection and not associated with any known organized effort."This was a broad search, including, for instance, ads bought from accounts with U.S. IP addresses but with the language set to Russian  even though they didn't necessarily violate any policy or law."In this part of our review, we found approximately $50,000 in potentially related ad spending on roughly 2,200 ads."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

But cancer stem cells often survive the treatment, and go on to produce new tumors.The ability to create new cells is also seen in neuroprogenitor cells, which Zika targets and destroys. This prompted scientists to hypothesize that it may also be able to target glioblastoma stem cells.Scientists infected tumors with one of two Zika virus strains, and found that both destroyed stem cells while bypassing other tumor cells.Mice were then injected with either a saltwater placebo or Zika virus cells. Researchers found that those infected with Zika had smaller tumors two weeks later.Mutations were also introduced into the Zika cells as an additional safety feature, rendering them still able to destroy cancer stem cells, but also easier to eliminate from the host body.The findings indicate that Zika infection can be used to complement conventional treatment to eradicate the cancer.

      <title>Paper-thin Brane Craft to clean space debris</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONENASA has awarded $500,000 for the development of an innovative new spacecraft that promises to get rid of orbital trash.According to a press release from the Aerospace Corporation, space debris in the form of spent rocket parts, old satellites, shrapnel and other items are accumulating around Earth's orbit, which may make collisions more common.To address this issue, NASA is looking to Aerospace's Brane Craft, a light, 3 foot-by-3 foot spacecraft that's thinner than human hair.When deployed, the Brane Craft moves toward a piece of debris and wraps itself around the item. It then fires its thrusters and pushes back toward the Earth.The spacecraft eventually lowers itself and the debris down to the atmosphere, where both are incinerated.The Brane Craft is intended to be light and cheap enough that it can be sacrificed at the end of a cleaning mission.But it may also have other applications beyond just collecting trash. The spacecraft is extremely fuel-efficient, making it fully capable of travelling long distances, perhaps to explore and mine asteroids or other space rocks.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Credit card numbers of 209,000 consumers were also taken, along with the dispute documents of 182,000 others.These personal details may well be used to engage in fraud and identity theft schemes, which Equifax was ironically in the business of protecting people from.Hackers reportedly accessed the data in mid-May through a web vulnerability, and maintained access until July 29.The data breach extends beyond the U.S., with Equifax saying data from people in Canada and the UK may have also been exposed.Likewise, people who aren't customers of Equifax may also be affected, since the firm obtains information from credit card companies, banks, and other sources to determine a person's credit score.The company is currently cooperating with the FBI, which is investigating the incident.

In the event of an evacuation, here's what you can do to prepare, according to the New York Times.Before leaving the house, make sure to pack an emergency kit with money, medication, a portable radio, flashlights and at least three days' worth of food and water. Designate a meeting spot with your family in case you get separated. Mobile phones may or may not work in affected areas. Make sure to photograph or scan important documents such as licenses, social security cards, passports, prescriptions and tax statements. Upload images online, so that you have backup copies. Store the documents in fireproof, watertight containers or bring them with you. The Food and Drug Administration suggests turning your refrigerator to the coldest setting, so that if the power goes out, items can stay cold longer. Even with no power, a freezer can stay cold for about 48 hours. Double check that dangerous chemicals like bleach, ammonia and drain cleaners are securely stored. Move electronics and small appliances as high up as possible. And lastly, clear the yard and board up your windows. Move or dispose of anything that could become a projectile if left on the ground.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Items that should be included in emergency kits  2. Family meeting a designated point3.

It is one of the deadliest and most destructive threat from a hurricane, according to ABC News Storm surges are responsible for around half of hurricane deaths since 1970, according to the National Hurricane Center, USA Today reported. The National Weather Service only started issuing storm surge alerts this hurricane season. About 1,000 miles of coastline from Tampa Bay to parts of South Carolina could experience a storm surge. Forecasters warn of a 10- to 15-foot surge in the Naples area and 5 to 8 feet around Tampa, ABC News reported. Storm surge watches and warnings are not included with hurricane alerts because hurricane winds and storm surges don't always occur at the same place or same time, said Rick Knabb, former director of the hurricane center, USA Today reported. During a storm surge, people should evacuate, while for wind warnings, they can stay in place as long as the structures is stable and away from flood-risk areas, Knabb added.

U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo planes started spraying insecticides over three eastern Texas counties during the weekend and plan to expand to other counties over the following weeks, said officials from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Reuters reported. The C-130 cargo planes flew from an air force base in San Antonio and joined two smaller planes. About 1.85 million acres have been treated as of Tuesday, the department said. The plan is to spray 6 million acres in total.  Officials hope the spraying will prevent mosquito-borne illnesses as well as protect emergency response workers and residents from swarms during cleanup efforts.The Air Force is using an organophosphate insecticide called naled, according to Quartz. Naled acts as a neurotoxin that targets adult mosquitoes, according to Newsweek. The health department sprays about 16 million acres a year with the insecticide. It is frequently used after disasters to deal with mosquitoes. Health officials urged residents to dispose of standing water, use repellant and wear long-sleeved clothing outdoors. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Researchers found that the participants were sedentary for 12.3 hours out of a 16-hour waking day.When measuring bout length, it was discovered that subjects who sat for longer periods at a time were more likely to have died at the end of the study period than those with shorter sitting spells.Findings indicate that moving around for every 30 consecutive minutes of inactivity may significantly decrease the risk for death.The study did not explain how sitting increases early death, but experts suggest inactivity exposes the body to higher blood glucose levels, which leads to problems like diabetes, heart disease, or stroke.Prolonged sitting may also weaken the abdominal muscles, hip flexors, and glutes.It could also lead to a lack of circulation in the legs, potentially resulting in blood clots forming in the veins  a condition known as deep vein thrombosis.Alas, working out after a long day of sitting in an office chair may not necessarily undo its ill effects. The best way to lengthen your lifespan, it seems, is to move about as often as you can.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Americans monitored over 10 days sedentary for 12.3 hours in a 16-hour day 2.

Scientists wanted to determine the effect tattoos had within the body, particularly the lymph nodes, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The study, published in Scientific Reports, examined lymph nodes and skin samples from deceased donors: four with tattoos and two with no tattoos, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Using X-ray fluorescence to identify ink particles and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to detect biomolecular changes in surrounding tissue, scientists found traces in the subjects with tattooes and none in the lymph nodes of the non-tattooed subjects.   They discovered stained lymph nodes in two of the subjects, one with blue ink and one with green. Researchers found elevated levels of metals including aluminum, chromium, iron, nickel and copper in the nodes and skin. The study concluded contamination could lead to chronic enlargement of the lymph nodes and long-term exposure to toxic compounds. The scientists say the next step will be to study what particular health effects ink particles may cause.   RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Tattoo ink particles traveling to lymph nodes2.

Cassini has been traveling around Saturn and its moons for 13 years, but it is finally running out of fuel, so NASA wants the probe disposed of properly, Space.com reported.The probe sped within 73,974 miles (119,049 kms) of Titan on Sept. 11 in a flyby meant to lower the spacecraft's orbit enough to ensure it will crash into Saturn's atmosphere, NASA officials said, according to Space.com. The main purpose of this last mission is to make sure that Cassini does not contaminate the moons of Titan or Enceladus with Earth microbes. Scientists think the two moons could possibly support life. Enceladus has an ocean of liquid water underneath its icy shell, as well as hydrothermal hot spots in the ocean.Titan is also believed to have a subsurface water ocean. The moon also has lakes and seas of hydrocarbons on its surface.     Once Cassini enters Saturn's thick atmosphere, it will take approximately five to six minutes for the probe to fall apart and melt. During its last dive, the probe will be sending data back to Earth in real time for researchers to analyze.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cassini probe traveling towards Saturn2. Cassini's final flight path 3.

They suffered further molecular damage to both the liver and brain after two to six months.The exposure also increased insulin resistance in the mice, and upped the release of the stress hormone epinephrine, making them prone to type-2 diabetes and immune fatigue.Though the research was conducted on animals, it nevertheless draws attention to the dangers of cigarette smoke even on a third-hand basis.Further studies should investigate the effects on humans, and possibly determine what effect long-term exposure will have on the body.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

As a result, "night" and "day" on the planet last a longer time than on Earth.So far, the day side has been studied extensively, but the night side has been notoriously difficult to observe, until now.According to the European Space Agency, Venus' atmosphere consists of strong winds blowing 60 times faster than the planet's rotation. This super-rotation has been assumed to be uniform in both sides, but new data from the Venus Express spacecraft shows the winds are more chaotic and irregular on the night side.Night side clouds formed large, wavy, filament-like patterns not seen in day clouds, and are dominated by stationary waves, which remain still and do not move with the atmosphere.Stationary waves were thought to form specifically over steep, mountainous areas, but were recently detected in the planet's southern hemisphere - an area with low elevation. The waves were likewise assumed to be rising up through the cloud from the surface, but were mysteriously missing from the lower and intermediate cloud levels.Scientists have yet to explore what this means, but will likely need to come up with new, updated models of Venus to help them figure it out.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>New state-of-the-art NFL helmet designed to lower risk of concussions</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEThis NFL season about 70 players are wearing a new state-of-the-art helmet designed to lower the risk of concussions. The Vicis Zero1, which sells for $1,500, was specifically designed to soften the blows NFL players take to their heads during games, CNN Money reported. The NFL and NFL Players Association have tested dozens of different helmet concepts in recent years with the Vicis ranking highest in safety, according to CNN Money. The helmet is made of four different protective layers. The outer shell is made from flexible thermoplastic that compresses to absorb shock, then rebounds, much like a car bumper. Next is a layer of more than 500 polymer columns that can twist and move laterally, reducing the impact of rotational acceleration, a major cause of concussions, the Washington Post reported.  Underneath that is a hard inner shell that helps prevent skull fractures and brain hemorrhages. Below that is a layer of memory foam to provide the player comfort.  About half of NFL teams have put in orders for the Vicis helmet. NFL players get to choose the helmet they wear from an approved NFL list.  The NFL has been looking to address concussions, especially as the league as faced increasing scrutiny. Medical experts and players are concerned that repeated concussions increase the likelihood of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The government has given the green light to a 700-MW addition to the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, New Atlas reported. The solar park is located about 50 kms south of Dubai, with the first phase inaugurated back in 2013, according to New Atlas. It currently has 2.3 million photovoltaic solar panels with a 200-MW capacity. Capacity is expected to grow to 5,000 MW by 2030. Developers say the park will eventually cover 214 sq km with a 260-m solar tower taking center stage.The solar plant produces power by using lenses and reflectors to concentrate sunlight in order to heat fluids, which then in turn produce steam to drive a turbine. An advantage to this type of solar system is that it's more flexible because energy can be stored as heat and used as needed. A drawback is that they are more expensive than photovoltaic solar plants. Construction of the new extension is set to begin in 2020.

The majority of fat in the body is unhealthy "white" tissue found around the waist, hips and thighs, the Guardian reported.  Smaller amounts of "brown" fat located around the neck and shoulders are packed with mitochondria that generate heat by burning up excess calories. Scientists from the Washington University School of Medicine found a way to turn white fat into "beige" fat, a healthier fat with some weight loss capabilities, in lab mice. "Our research suggest that by targeting a protein in white fat, we can convert bad fat into a fat that fights obesity," Dr. Irfan Lodhi said. Beige fat was discovered in adults in 2015 and found to behave like brown fat. Researchers found that by blocking the PexRAP protein in mice, white fat was transformed into calorie burning beige fat.

"It could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific," Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told reporters at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the Atlantic reported. If a hydrogen bomb did hit the Pacific, it would detonate with a blinding flash, while producing a massive mushroom cloud. The immediate fallout would depend on the height of detonation.  The initial blast would instantly kill most fish and marine life in the blast area.  The explosion would send radioactive particles flying through the air and into the water. Wind also has the potential to carry the particles hundreds of miles. The smoke created at the strike zone could potentially block the sun, hurting organisms that utilize photosynthesis. Radiation would lead to severe health problems for surrounding aquatic life. Humans could also be affected if radioactive fallout reaches land. Particles could contaminate air, water and soil.

It's supported by a stem that's anchored to the sea floor with mooring cables, which, like the blades, is flexible and can bend under pressure.Inside the turbine head is a magnet electric generator, which transforms wave energy into electricity. The electricity is sent back to the shore via cables, to feed into the grid.Using turbines on just 1% of Japan's coastline can generate roughly 10 gigawatts of energy, equivalent to about 10 nuclear power plants.Apart from tetrapods, the turbines can also harness electricity near coral reefs.They're built to be safe for marine life, with blade speed carefully calibrated so that any animals caught in them can escape unharmed.The team is currently preparing to install two half-scale model turbines that will power LEDs as part of a commercial demonstration.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Any robot tax would likely need to fill this gap in public finances.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that the British government will collect 716.5 billion for the tax year 2016 to 2017. According to the IFS figures 43.1 percent, or 308.6 billion, of this is contributed by the 30 million people in the British workforce.Separately, a PWC study estimates that 10 million British workers may lose their jobs to automation. If permanent, and not counting the amount the government may save from automation, this would lead to a shortfall of 92.6 pounds, or 30%, in what the British state collects.A flat robot tax may help fill this gap. However, calls for automation to help people live comfortably via state-provided benefits  such as a universal income  may well see automation taxes rise. Such a move would likely scare off private industry from investing in the United Kingdom.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of truck driver being replaced by automation2.

"However, calls for automation to help people live comfortably via state-provided benefits  such as a universal income  may well see automation taxes rise."SOURCES: British Labour Party, Institute For Fiscal Studies, Office for National Statistics, The Guardian http://press.labour.org.uk/https://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn09.pdfhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/february2016https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/24/millions-uk-workers-risk-replaced-robots-study-warns***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

The answer, it seems, lies in Earth's explosive history.Early Earth often collided with other planetary bodies, with the impact generating enough heat to turn rocks into either magma or hot vapor. One study, led by a University of Bristol geochemist, calculated that planet lost 40 percent of its mass from this process.A second study, from Oxford University, combined Earth rock with volatile elements such as gold, silver, and zinc oxide, and heated it to 1,300 degrees Celsius. After cooling the rock, they discovered that the volatile elements had evaporated.This same vapor loss was found in samples from Mars and the asteroid Vesta, suggesting that the phenomenon occurs in similar-sized bodies.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Football players may be able to be diagnosed for CTE before death</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com or contact inquiries@nextanimation.com.tw to license this or any News Direct videoFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twRESTRICTIONS: NONEResearchers may have found a way to diagnose chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players while they are still alive. CTE is a progressive brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. It usually shows up years after taking repeated blows to the head, and can lead to symptoms like confusion, depression, aggression, memory retention, and other forms of cognitive degeneration, according to Quartz. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Researchers have found that people who had CTE displayed abnormal clusters of the tau protein throughout the brain.Doctors believe the tau protein is responsible for killing off neurons.  Researchers at Boston University wanted to look for other markers in people suffering from CTE. Scientists found that people with CTE showed elevated levels of the protein CLL11 in both spinal fluid and the blood around the brain in the skull. They believe the CLL11 protein helps the smallest blood vessels in the brain move oxygen. Higher levels of CLL11 could mean these blood vessels are leaking, which may lead to CTE symptoms. The team at Boston University is now working with a biotech company to develop a blood test to detect CLL11 and diagnose living players. More research still needs to be conducted on the CLL11 protein to confirm it isn't linked with other kinds of neurodegenerative diseases. There's no cure for CTE, but early diagnosis could give players a chance to mitigate the disease.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Football players running into each other2.
