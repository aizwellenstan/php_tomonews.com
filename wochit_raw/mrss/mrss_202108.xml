Location of megaripples in relation to original impact of asteroidVOICEOVER (in English): "The theory that the asteroid which made all non-avian dinosaurs extinct also sent a mile-high tsunami crashing into North America has been further confirmed by the discovery of fossilised 'megaripples,' according to a new study published in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters journal.""Occurring 66 million years ago, the flow of huge waves may have continued for days as they reflected back on themselves multiple times within the Gulf of Mexico, according to the study.""According to Science Alert, the effects of the tsunami would have imposed devastation for thousands of miles, forcing sea life onto land and land life into the sea. However, atmospheric changes were primarily responsible for wiping out up to 75 percent of species on the planet at the time.""The asteroid hit with the power of 10 billion atomic bombs, according to previous research by the Jackson School of Geosciences, and initially this turned the planet into a fiery hellscape. However, when sulfur-bearing minerals from the impact site were released into the atmosphere, they began reflecting sunlight away from the planet, causing catastrophic global cooling.""The latest addition to this picture of Earth in the moments just after the apocalyptic impact comes via gigantic ripples below its surface. They were engraved by the tsunami in sediments 1,500 meters or 5,000 feet below what is now central Louisiana.""These megaripples show average wavelengths of 600 meters or 1,968 feet, and average wave heights of 16 meters or 52 feet, making them the largest ripples documented on Earth, according to the study."SOURCES: Earth and Planetary Science Letters journal, Jackson School of Geosciences, Science Alert, Science Magazinehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X21003186?via%3Dihubhttps://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2019/09/rocks-at-asteroid-impact-site-record-first-day-of-dinosaur-extinction/https://www.sciencealert.com/tsunami-megaripples-from-the-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-impact-discovered-in-louisianahttps://www.sciencealert.com/catastrophic-new-details-from-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died-uncovered-in-fossilshttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/giant-tsunami-dino-killing-asteroid-impact-revealed-fossilized-megaripples?utm_campaign=SciMag&utm_source=Social&utm_medium=Reddit***]]></description>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe BBC reports that conservation workers have been covering the Presena Glacier in northern Italy with huge cloth sheets every year since 2008. They put the sheets on at the end of the ski season and take them off again in September, ready for the cooler temperatures and winter snowfalls. These sheets are made from a special reflective material called a "geotextile," which reflects the sun's rays to help prevent the snow underneath from melting. The conservationists say about 70 percent of the snow can be saved over the summer by using the protective sheets. Each sheet is five meters wide and 70 meters long, and they are sewn together and weighted in place so they don't blow away. In total they cover around 120,000 square meters of the glacier. Covering this much of the glacier is no easy task and can take between a month and six weeks for the team to complete. The volume of the Presena Glacier has shrunk by more than a third since 1993. The glacier has also been plagued by algae that turns its white snow pink. The algae also absorbs sunlight and increases the risk of ice melting.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The giant forest had previously been a carbon sink, absorbing the airborne carbon that is driving the climate crisis. Sadly, the Amazon is now causing the acceleration of the climate crisis, researchers said. Most of the emissions are caused by fires, many deliberately set to clear land for beef and soy production. But even without fires, hotter temperatures and droughts mean the southeastern Amazon has become a source of CO2, rather than a sink. The scientists said the discovery that part of the Amazon was emitting carbon even without fires was particularly worrying. They said it was most likely the result of each year's deforestation and fires making adjacent forests more susceptible the next year. The trees produce much of the region's rain, so fewer trees means more severe droughts and heatwaves, which cause more tree deaths and fires.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The Post says these smartphones were on a list of more than 50,000 numbers that are concentrated in countries known to engage in surveillance of their citizens. These countries' governments are known to be clients of the Israeli company, NSO Group, whose Pegasus spyware is ostensibly licensed to track terrorists and major criminals. Many of the numbers on the list were in the Middle East, but the greatest number was in Mexico. The targeted individuals include top military and political officials, as well as journalists and human rights activists.

That maximum speed would make the train, which was self-developed by China and manufactured in the coastal city of Qingdao, the fastest ground vehicle in the world. Using electro-magnetic force, the maglev train "levitates" above the track with no contact between itself and the rail. This means that the train hovers on magnetic fields created by huge currents of electricity. China has been using the technology for almost two decades on a very limited scale. Shanghai has a short maglev line running from one of its airports to town. While there are currently no inter-city maglev lines in China that could make good use of the higher speeds, cities like Shanghai and Chengdu have started to conduct research.

One of the ways in which the UAE seeds clouds, is by using electricity-inducing drones. The drones were developed by the UAE and researchers from the University of Reading in England. They get catapulted into the air and cruise through the sky, gathering weather data and giving a nudge to clouds in the form of an electrical charge. The idea is that the electrical charge helps clump water droplets and other particles together to make new and bigger clouds that actually have a chance to generate much-needed precipitation. This is important since the UAE typically receives only four inches, or 10 centimeters, of rain per year. The idea is to make the droplets inside the clouds big enough so that when they fall out of the cloud, they survive down to the surface.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The probe has been sensing small quakes on the planet since early 2019. Its readings reveal that Mars' crust is between 24 and 72 kilometers thick, which is thinner than expected. But the key finding is the size of the planet's liquid and metallic core. Its radius of 1,830 kilometers is wider than expected. This means that the mantle between the core and the crust is thinner than previously thought. And that means it's highly unlikely this mantle can achieve the pressures where the mineral bridgmanite becomes stable. On Earth, this stiff mineral blankets the core, slowing convection and the loss of heat. On early Mars, its absence would have led to rapid cooling. This initially would have permitted strong convection in the metal core, which drove a global magnetic field. But because of rapid cooling, this has now switched off and today Mars has no global magnetic field.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Approximately 25 F-22s will be joined by 10 F-15 fighters and support planes, as part of an exercise that is meant to send a strong message to China, amid growing tensions about China's actions around Taiwan and in the South China Sea. The exercise is designed to spread U.S. combat planes out among airfields across the region, to increase their chances of surviving enemy missile strikes. Much of the U.S.'s air power in the western Pacific is concentrated in two large military installations on Okinawa and Guam. A strike on those bases could cripple the U.S. military's ability to hit back if too much U.S. air power was concentrated there. The new exercise will see crews practicing from smaller, less developed airfields on Guam and islands like Tinian.

In Bezos' original proposal for the lunar landing system, his Blue Origin company would team up with other companies to build three vehicles, called elements. These three elements would be launched separately and link up in Earth orbit. This is where the Transfer Element would be used to transport the whole package to the moon. Once in position over the moon, the other two elements would detach, using the Descent Element's thrusters to slow them down so they could fall to the moon's surface. The Descent Element would also protect the astronaut-carrying Ascent Element from flying rocks, although this would mean that the astronauts would have to climb down a long ladder to get to the surface. Once it's time to return, the Ascent Element would fire its own rockets to blast back into moon orbit, where it would meet up again with the Transfer Element.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Identified via satellite imagery, the new missile base in China's Xinjiang region may eventually include 110 silos, according to a report by the Federation of American Scientists, or FAS. It is the second apparent silo field uncovered this month by researchers, adding to 120 silos that appear to be under construction in the neighboring province of Gansu. For decades, China has operated around 20 silos for its liquid-fueled ICBMs, called the DF-5. Now, it appears to be building 10 times more, possibly for housing its newest ICBM, the DF-41, according to the FAS report. The New York Times says the new silos are clearly being built to be discovered. The most recent silo field is in the eastern part of the Xinjiang region, not far from one of China's notorious Uyghur "re-education" camps in the city of Hami.

Identified via satellite imagery, the new missile base in China's Xinjiang region may eventually include 110 silos, according to a report by the Federation of American Scientists, or FAS. It is the second apparent silo field uncovered this month by researchers, adding to 120 silos that appear to be under construction in the neighboring province of Gansu. For decades, China has operated around 20 silos for its liquid-fueled ICBMs, called the DF-5. Now, it appears to be building 10 times more, possibly for housing its newest ICBM, the DF-41, according to the FAS report. The New York Times says the new silos are clearly being built to be discovered. The most recent silo field is in the eastern part of the Xinjiang region, not far from one of China's notorious Uyghur "re-education" camps in the city of Hami. The road network linking the different silo construction sites also makes the area look suspiciously like a massive nuclear base on satellite images.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
