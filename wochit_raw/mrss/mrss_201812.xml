The results, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, found that seas around the globe may be absorbing up to 60 percent more heat since the 1990s than earlier estimates calculated, according to Scientific American. Researchers calculated the oceans have absorbed around 13 zettajoules of heat energy every year between 1991 and 2016, CNN reports.The findings suggest the earth is more sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions than previously thought. Rather than relying on direct ocean measurements, the researchers looked at the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since 1991. As oceans warm up, their ability to absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide decreases, thus more of those gases remain in the air. By measuring the changes in atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, while also controlling for other factors such as human greenhouse gas emissions, the team was able to estimate how much heat the oceans have absorbed over the past few decades. Warmer oceans could potentially lead to sea levels rising faster than forecasted, dying off of coral reefs, increasingly powerful storms, faster rates of melting sea ice and affecting ocean currents, CNN reports.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to NPR, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry on Tuesday found that when young people stop using marijuana their verbal learning and memory improve. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital looked at 88 participants age 16 to 25, who were regular users of marijuana. According to the study's lead author, Randi Schuster, director of neuropsychology at Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Addiction Medicine, the researchers recruited a range of participants. Some of the young people smoked once per week, while others smoked almost daily. Participants were randomly assigned into an abstaining group or a non-abstaining group.  Volunteers had their urine tested weekly and were also given a variety of tasks testing their attention and memory. Researchers found that after four weeks, there was no noticeable difference in attention scores between the two groups. However, memory scores for nonusers improved, while users' memory scores remained relatively steady. The study concluded that adolescents learn better when they are not using cannabis, and that some of the deficits from usage appear to be reversible. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This included former slaves, who at the time didn't have the right to own property, roam freely or even stay in the country.However, it was still never clearly defined whether or not children born of immigrants in the U.S. were automatically U.S. citizens.Then came the case of Wong Kim Ark. Wong was the son of Chinese immigrants and was born in California. After he returned from a trip to China in 1895, the federal government tried to stop him from re-entering the U.S. under the Chinese Exclusion Act. His case ended up in court, and after a years-long battle, the Supreme Court in 1898 ruled that Wong was in fact a U.S. citizen, as he was born in the U.S. Meanwhile, despite all this, Native Americans were still consistently denied rights given to others born in the U.S. until Congress finally granted citizenship to all Native Americans in 1924.President Donald Trump has announced plans to issue an Executive order to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court would still have the power to overturn the Executive order and interpret the Constitution on its own.Other than the U.S., there are 30 other nations in the world that recognize birthright citizenship including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Panama and Mexico.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers have found evidence of links between tumors in male rats and exposure to radio frequency radiation.A final report released on Thursday by the U.S. National Toxicology Program details an experiment in which about 3,000 rats and mice were exposed to whole body radio frequency radiation nine hours a day for up to two years. Rats began exposure to the radiation in the womb while mice started at 5-6 weeks old. The radiation used in the experiment was similar to those emitted by 2G and 3G mobile phones. The rodents lived in specially designed chambers with isolated rooms where a transmitting antenna subjected the rats to RFR fields with frequencies of 900 and 1900 megahertz. The study found evidence that radiation exposure was associated with the emergence of tumors in the hearts, brains, and adrenal glands of male rats. However, cancers found in female rats and male and female mice weren't conclusively linked to radio frequency radiation exposure.The research cost $30 million and was ongoing for a decade. The NTP's goal was to gather information on the effects of mobile phone radiation on rats in response to the increasing universality of cellphone use among humans. However, NTP scientists and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated that the results of the research do not directly affect humans since the rodents were exposed to extreme levels of cellphone radiation, which surpass the current safety limits on mobile phone radiation. The results also do not apply to Wi-Fi signals or phones that use 4G or 5G technologies, these use different methods of signal modulation that the NTP did not study in their research.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the Associated Press, most of the approximately 4,000 migrants are now moving along what some are referring to as the "route of death" to the town of Cordoba around 124 miles away. The next portion of the journey will be one of the longest yet, as the migrants will now have to pass via the sugar fields and fruit groves of Veracruz, a state where hundreds of migrants have gone missing in recent years due to kidnappers looking for ransom payments. A large majority of the migrants are trying to escape rampant poverty, gang violence and political unrest in the countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Mexico now has three caravans totalling more than 6,000 migrants spread out over 300 miles of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz. President Trump has ordered more than 7,000 active duty troops to be deployed throughout Texas, Arizona and California along the Mexican border in response to the caravan. According the Associated Press, President Donald Trump could sign an order next week allowing for mass detention of migrants caught entering the U.S. and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.

According to NPR, the federal spending bill approved in September includes $1.6 billion in 2019 for wall construction, which could begin as early as February.  In October, the Department of Homeland Security issued a waiver to 28 laws protecting public lands, wildlife and the environment in order so that construction could go ahead. In July, scientists published a paper highlighting the negative impacts of the border wall on wildlife by eliminating, degrading or fragmenting habitats. A wall would block access to water and food, and inhibit seasonal migrations. According to Phys.org, in a letter published in March in the journal Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment, other researchers also expressed worry the wall could damage the increasingly rare Tamaulipan thornscrub ecosystem. Other species that would be affected are the endangered wildflower Zapata bladderpod and the threatened whiskerbush cactus.  According to the researchers, negative impacts could be reduced by limiting physical barriers and accompanying roads, while considering building structures that allow animals to pass through and barrier alternatives like electronic sensors.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Los Angeles Times, the mud pool, dubbed the "Slow One," began moving six months ago, advancing at an unprecedented rate. It began covering a distance of 18 meters over a few months, but now covers the same distance in a single day.The geyser is in close proximity to the San Andreas fault and is a result of seismic movements in the area. According to Live Science, earthquakes created deep fractures underground that allowed gases to move to the earth's surface, creating boiling mud pools heated by carbon dioxide.Despite its closeness to the famous fault, there is no data suggesting that the recent activities could lead to a large earthquake. However, local authorities are fearful for the damage this geologic phenomenon could cause to local infrastructure.Boiling mud has already forced the Union Pacific Railroad to build temporary tracks after the mud seeped through a barrier they had built to prevent it from damaging the railroad.

Counties must turn in their unofficial returns by noon on Saturday, Nov. 10. The secretary of state is required to order a machine recount if the margin in a statewide election is less than 0.5 percent. Losing candidates can refuse a recount. If an automated recount is ordered, the second round of unofficial returns would be due from counties by 3 p.m. on Thursday Nov. 15.    In a machine recount, damaged ballots are copied, all ballots are re-scanned and then the number of total votes cast according to the machines are compared with the number of votes initially tallied by the county.If the machine recount numbers are similar, the vote is counted as accurate. And if the margin in the race is larger than 0.25 percent, the results are counted as official. If the margin after the second round of machine counting falls below 0.25 percent, then Florida can order a manual recount for federal and state elections. A manual recount involves counting each overvote and undervote by hand. An overvote refers to voters marking more choices than permitted on the ballot. An undervote means the voter made no choice or fewer than the number of allowable choices on the ballot.   On Nov. 16, overseas and military ballots are counted. Counties need to give official returns by noon on Nov. 18. Official results from counties are then certified by the state on Nov. 20. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Some used bar stools to break the windows and escape.Others ran out the back, hid under pool tables, in the attic, or in the bathroom.Ventura County deputy Ron Helus was first at the scene with a highway officer. They engaged the suspect in a shootout, but Deputy Telus was shot several times and later died. In all, 12 people were killed in the shooting.According to the Los Angeles Times, Long was dead when officers found him at the scene, and an autopsy later determined he had died from a self-inflicted gunshot.Long had been a former Marine machine gunner, and is said to have carried the attack out with military efficiency, though authorities have yet to determine a motive.A former coach described him as physically combative during his teen years, while  a mental health specialist that assessed him recently thought he could be suffering from PTSD.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Harvard astrophyscists claim space rock could be an alien probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[New theoretical research by Harvard scientists suggests that the solar system’s first interstellar object might be an alien probe.Oumuamua was first observed by the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System in Hawaii in October 2017. The name means “a messenger that reaches out from the distant past” in Hawaiian.Research published in the journal Nature last year says it is the first interstellar object to enter our solar system and said it would travel inside it for over a year. Scientists weren’t sure if it was an asteroid or a comet, so they referred to it as an interstellar object. Oumuamua is 800 meters in length and 80 meters in width, according to Astronomy.com.Scientists speculated last year that it may consist of materials like metals or rocks.A yet-to-be-published theoretical study accepted in Astrophysical Journal Letters puts forward a number of theories on the object, including ideas that it may be extraterrestrial in origin. They theorize Oumuamua might be using a light sail to travel.This technology uses light to propel objects through space. The researchers write that it could be used to transport cargo between planets or stars. Another theory, the researchers describe as a “more exotic scenario”, is that Oumuamua is a fully working space probe sent to Earth by an alien civilization. However this claim has been disputed by other astronomers.Astrophysicist Alan Fitzsimmons told the AFP that this wasn’t evidence of alien life.He explained that Oumuamua has already show characteristics similar to that of a comet from another star system.When NASA observed it last year, they said the object was traveling at 64,000 kph. The space agency noted Oumuamua would exit the solar system in January 2019 after passing through Saturn’s orbit. Its next destination is the Pegasus constellation.]]></description>

According to their study, published in the paper Nano Journal, the team used button mushrooms due to their optimal levels of humidity and temperature which make them exceptional hosts to bacteria.  They then employed 3D printing technology to create a pattern of graphene nanoribbons on the cap of a living mushroom. They then printed cyanobacteria on top of the pattern using special 'bio-ink'.This bacteria was selected due to its efficiency in converting sunlight to energy. According to researchers who participated in the study it has 'an internal quantum efficiency of nearly 100%.'The team is calling this 'engineered bionic symbiosis'. The mushroom provides the cyanobacteria with shelter and nutrients which allows the bacteria to thrive and in turn create more energy. Exposing mushroom to light triggers cyanobacterial photosynthesis during which the bacteria releases electrons that are in turn captured by the strips of graphene. According to a news release by the American Chemical Society, the team managed to generate 65 nanoamps of electric energy. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the L.A. Times, the fire, which has killed two people and caused the evacuation of more than 250,000 people from Malibu to Thousand Oaks, was only 15 percent contained as of Sunday night. The forecast is calling for wind gusts of 40 miles per hour or stronger over the next few days. According to officials, the blaze has destroyed more than 177 buildings, with around 57,000 structures still at risk.Firefighters are now concerned that potential wind gusts could suddenly change directions, affecting the fire.  Strong winds could also hamper the effectiveness of aerial water and retardant drops. As of Sunday, several parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties  including Malibu, Agoura Hills, Westlake VIllage, Hidden Hills and parts of West Hills, Monte Nido, Gated Oaks and Topanga  remained under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders.

On August 14, 2015, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump signed an agreement in collaboration with Indonesian investor Hary Tanoesoedibjo's MNC Group to develop the Trump International Hotel and Tower Bali, the SCMP reports.The proposed "six-star" resort and 18-hole golf course are set to be built on a cliff-top site previously home to the Pan Pacific Nirwana Bali, according to the SCMP. Of particular concern is the proposed development's environmental impact on the water supply. According the NPR, Audubon International estimates the average American golf course requires about 312,000 gallons of water a day.According to Deutsche Welle, over half of Bali's groundwater is used by the island's tourism industry. The industry's water demands are putting Bali's rice terraces and subak irrigation system at risk.

However, missiles could be launched from there in an event of an emergency.Victor Cha, a prominent North Korean expert, claims the missile bases are actively in use and are not "decaying."This comes amid reports that North Korea was dismantling a key missile site in July.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to New Atlas, the O-Wind Turbine  a crooked, vented spherical device  is designed to generate electricity in the chaotic wind conditions of urban areas. Modern cities and their skyscrapers alter wind patterns, causing three-dimensional vortices where wind is constantly changing directions.  Taking inspiration from NASA's "tumbleweed" technology, a team from Lancaster University designed a turbine with a somewhat spherical shape, covered in vents that have large inlets and small outlets for air to pass through. Because of Bernoulli's principle, differences in pressure cause the turbine to rotate clockwise around a single fixed axis regardless of which direction the wind comes from. The rotational energy from the turbine can then be used to run a generator and produce electricity. According to team member Nicolas Gonzalo, the device could allow, "people living in apartments to generate their own electricity." RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. O-Wind turbine and wind blowing through city2.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANIf Theresa May's Brexit deal passes into law, what will it mean for the United Kingdom? The Brexit deal consists of two documents. The first is a 585-page agreement ending Britain's relationship with Europe, while the second is a seven-page outline describing the future relationship, according to the Guardian. The transition period would begin on March 29, 2019 and end on December 31, 2020. During this time the U.K. would have to follow all E.U. rules, but would not have membership in its institutions, according to the BBC. The withdrawal agreement would allow for the transition to be extended only once for a limited period, but would require both the U.K. and E.U. to agree for an extension before July 1, 2020. The Brexit draft also includes the calculations for how much the U.K. would need to pay the E.U. to settle all of its obligations.U.K. citizens in the E.U. and E.U. citizens in the U.K. will keep their residency and social security rights after the withdrawal. If by the end of 2020, no long-term trade deal is agreed upon, and if there is no transition period extension, then a backstop of "a single customs territory between the Union and the United Kingdom" would take effect. In a backstop setting, the U.K. is subject to "level playing field conditions" to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage while in the same customs territory. To exit the backstop it would require bilateral agreement between the U.K. and the E.U. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Transition period and one time extension2. UK paying EU, EU 3. Backstop between UK and EU4.

The donut-shaped machine supports nuclear fusion by using magnetic fields that keep hot plasma from melting the exterior walls of the tokamak. Nuclear fusion is a thermonuclear process that occurs when the nuclei of two light atoms, usually hydrogen, combine and form a heavier atom, in this case helium. This process results in release of energy in the form of heat and light  the same way by which the sun produces its warmth. Researcher's from the EAST project hope to develop technology that will allow humans to someday extract clean energy from nuclear fusion.

"Two cables holding the elevator broke soon after.""People inside said they felt the elevator moving fast and saw a material that looked like dust begin seeping in. "The elevator fell 84 floors before suddenly stopping near the 11th floor.""Because of the building's blind-shaft layout, there were no openings between floors."

Collected particles will be stored in a canister with nitrogen allowed to escape, leaving between 60 and 200 grams of material.Once sampling is complete, and the material safe inside a heatproof Sample Return Capsule, the OSIRIS-REx will execute small maneuvers to back away from Bennu.The spacecraft will then journey back to Earth and eject the capsule just outside Earth's atmosphere, to land in the Utah desert in September 2023.Bennu is roughly 4.5 billion years old, and as an ancient relic of our solar system's early days, scientists believe it could shed light on how that system was formed.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to CNN, police and the fishermen who reported seeing 26-year-old John Allen Chau's body last week, went close to the island on Friday and Saturday in an attempt to find a way to recover the body.   The police and fishermen saw a group of islanders armed with bows, arrows and spears guarding something on the beach, the New York Times reported.According to Dependra Pathak, a top police official in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, "we have mapped the area with the help of these fishermen. We have not spotted the body yet but we roughly know the area where he is believed to be buried." Pathak added the Sentinelese were patrolling the beach around the same spot Chau was killed. Instead of approaching to retrieve the body, police sketched out the crime scene and then sailed away. North Sentinel Island is home to one of the last remaining untouched hunter-and-gatherer societies left in the world. It's about the size of Manhattan with an estimated population of about a few dozen people. India has kept the island off limits in order to prevent Sentinelese from catching modern illnesses and to keep trespassers from being killed.According to Indian law, people are not allowed to travel within five nautical miles of the  island and the Indian Navy patrols is day and night.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANEngineers at MIT have designed a plane that flies using only ionic thrust. The aircraft was designed to resemble a glider, it weighs roughly two kilograms and has a 5-meter wingspan. The plane has two rows of wires under its wing. The row at the front end of the wing carries 20,000 volts of positively charged particles called ions. The ions are then attracted to the row on the back end of the wing which carries a negative charge of 20,000 volts. As the ions move to the back row they collide with neutral air pushing it behind the glider and generating electroaerodynamic thrust, driving the aircraft forward. This air is called ionic wind.According to their study, published in the journal Nature, the team tested the glider inside a gym where it managed to sustain flight and travel 60 meters, making it the first solid state flightor flight without moving parts like turbines and propellers.Engineers participating in the study hope this technology can be the first step towards designing aircrafts that are quieter and do not emit combustion emissions.

Officials feared it might topple over and closed it to the public for corrective work.Cables were attached to the third storey to stabilize the tower. Counterweights and braces were added while soil was removed from the north side to allow it to straighten out.Experts say the Tower of Pisa is now stable, and has lost 1.5 inches of its tilt over the past 17 years, from its reopening in 2001 to the present.CBS reports that at its current pace, it may take another thousand years for the tower to straighten out completely.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers from the National University of Singapore have found a way to convert plastic bottles into an ultralight super material with various applications.Eco-Business reports that the process involves plastic bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate or PET. These are first shredded into fibers and combined with several chemicals, including hydrochloric acid and polyvinyl acetate.The solution is put in a sonicator where it is mixed using sound energy, then freeze-dried to produce an aerogel that is soft, durable, and flexible. One plastic bottle can produce an A4 sheet of aerogel.According to a press release from the National University of Singapore, the aerogel is versatile, and can serve unique functions depending on the surface treatments. When coated with an amine group, it can be used in pollution masks to absorb dust particles and carbon dioxide.It can absorb large amounts of oil when incorporated with various methyl groups, and withstand temperatures of up to 620 degrees Celsius when coated with fire retardant chemicals.Researchers have listed several practical uses for the aerogels, like cleaning oil spills, building insulation, or as a lightweight thermal lining for firefighter coats.The fabrication process is also quicker and more cost-effective than conventional methods, and easily scalable for mass production. Because of this, the team is hopeful that the technology can help decrease the damage brought about by widespread plastic pollution.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the Guardian, Japan plans to upgrade its two Izumo-class helicopter carriers to transport and launch fighter jets.The Nikkei News Service reported that Japan was set to purchase 100 F-35s from the U.S. in a deal worth more than US$8.8 billion.According to CNN, the package includes F-35 A and B models. F-35As are similar to conventional fighter jets that use a runway for take off and landing. F-35Bs have short take off and vertical landing capability, meaning they can be used at smaller airports or operate from flattop warships. Japan's Izumo-class carrier is 814 meters long and can carry up to 14 helicopters.According to former US Navy captain and current Hawaii Pacific University Professor Carl Schuster telling CNN, a refitted Japanese carrier would only be able to carry six to eight F-35Bs.     According to Mainichi Shimbun, the carriers would be used to defend Japan's remote south-western islands.    RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Japan Izumo-class carriers and an F35B performing a vertical take off2.

The men will be tracked for up to 16 weeks to ensure sperm levels have declined, with women using an alternative form of birth control. Couples will then use the gel as the sole method of contraception for 52 weeks, to see if it does prevent pregnancy.After the trials, male participants will be observed for several more weeks to check for any after effects, and make sure sperm production returns to normal.Results from the trial are expected in 2022. If successful, it will need to be evaluated in a larger trial before it can obtain FDA approval and be available commercially.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Research in mice suggests production of brown fat could help battle obesity</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers at the University of Cambridge believe a molecule present in rats could help fight obesity in humans. Humans have two types of fat, white and brown. White fat stores energy and acts as a thermal insulator. However, excessive amounts could lead to diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancer. Brown fat, on the other hand, burns calories to generate heat. Scientists from the University of Cambridge detected a molecule in mice called BMP8b. This protein controls the activation of brown fat in the brain and body tissue of mice. According to their study published in the journal Nature, they analyzed mice that had been bred to produce higher levels of the molecule in fat tissue. Researchers discovered that increased levels of the protein caused white fat to become beige  or turn brown burning more calories and generating more energy as a result. They concluded that it could be possible to create a drug that alters fat function in humans just as the BMP8b protein does in mice. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.
