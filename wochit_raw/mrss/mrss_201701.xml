      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Space robot: NASA to launch autonomous satellite repair robot Restore-L in summer 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA  In the summer of 2020, NASA will launch the Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft tasked with carrying out maintenance and repair on satellites orbiting earth.NASA awarded a $127 million contract to California-based Space Systems/Loral build Restore-L, reported Vice’s technology news website Motherboard.According to information posted on the Restore-L section of NASA Robotic Servicing Mission website, it will navigate Earth’s orbit using a combination of advanced hardware and algorithms at speeds of over 16,000 miles per hour. This technology will allow it to calculate how to connect with a satellite orbiting the earth at the same speed.Restore-L will use dexterous mechanical arms to service satellites in low earth orbit. This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control.

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge - TomoNews</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Giraffes face threat of extinction after numbers drop by 40% in just 30 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND   Once thought to be abundant in number, giraffes are now in danger of extinction, according to the authors of a report published on Thursday.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.Giraffes, the world’s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.The biggest threats to giraffes’ survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Nuclear football: US president's emergency satchel of nuclear codes will go to Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   The mysterious “nuclear football” that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.The “nuclear football” is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as “Yankee White.” The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the ‘football’ must always be within reach of the president.If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president’s decision.The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country’s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon Go grocery store gets rid of long, tedious checkout lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  Amazon is opening a grocery store in downtown Seattle early next year where customers can make their purchases without waiting in checkout lines.The store, called Amazon Go, allows customers to make purchases without the aid of a cashier.Customers would simply need to download the an app onto their phones, open an Amazon account, and visit the Amazon Go store.Amazon’s promotional video shows how customers are admitted into the store after opening their Amazon Go app and scanning it on the turnstiles. The app generates a QR code that logs the customer into the store’s network and connects to the customer’s Amazon account. This prevents shoplifting as the customer’s identity is recognized and stored.The entire store is equipped with computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning technology. It can automatically detect when products are taken from the shelves and records them in virtual shopping carts. The products are removed from the carts if they are placed back onto the shelves.When leaving the store, customers have to pass through turnstiles equipped with sensors that signal the app to calculate the cost of the purchases. The payment is then charged to the customer’s Amazon account.The pictures shown on the Amazon website suggest that some staff might still be responsible for making ready-to-eat meals or other preparations at the store, but the store would probably not include any cashiers or people to bag groceries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 3.4 million Americans are working as cashiers. The New York Post quoted Britt Beam, president of America’s Research Group  a consumer-behavior research firm  saying that Amazon’s technology might wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery-store staff.]]></description>

      <title>Russian drone sub: New drone can imitate any enemy submarine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon have an ocean-going robotized system at his disposal that can mimic the characteristics of different submarines, making it useful for naval exercises as well as reconnaissance missions.The Surrogat, an autonomous, unmanned submarine powered by lithium-ion batteries  that can operate for 15 to 16 hours at a time, is being developed by military designers from Russia’s Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, Russian news agency TASS reports. The drone measures more than 50 feet long and weighs almost 40 tons, with a maximum diving depth of almost 2,000 feet.It can employ towed sonar arrays to simulate another submarine’s acoustic and electromagnetic fields and imitate both conventional and nuclear submarines.The Surrogat can also be used for underwater terrain mapping and reconnaissance.Military designers claim the drone is simple to operate, with low maintenance and upgrade costs. They are currently in talks with the Russian Navy, and believe there may be interest from foreign customers.]]></description>

      <title>Cameroon to turn human waste to clean power in biogas project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BUEA, CAMEROON  Two towns in Cameroon have installed biogas systems to turn human waste into sustainable energy that can provide fuel and electricity for local communities.The project was initiated by Bioenergy-Cameroon, a non-governmental youth organization. Local students, especially female students, are trained on how to install and maintain innovative technology systems such as solar power and biogas mechanisms.According to Reuters, the system includes a septic tank, which is connected to a bio-digester at individual households. Human waste placed in the septic tank is converted into biogas inside the bio-digesters, which release energy into people’s homes for cooking and lighting.Reuters reports that more than 3,000 households and local schools in the towns of Buea and Bamenda have installed the biogas system. The Center for Environment and Development, an NGO in Cameroon, estimates that the biogas project may reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the vicinity by up to 60 percent.]]></description>

      <title>Hyperloop One to build first Hyperloop System in UAE</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DUBAI, UAE  Los Angeles-based start-up Hyperloop One has signed an agreement with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to build the world’s first Hyperloop system, which will connect Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.The stations for Hyperloop One’s system, called Hyperportals, will be located in the city centers. The Hyperportal in Abu Dhabi will be located near the Etihad Towers, while the one in Dubai will be located near the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.Passengers will travel in pods, which come in four different configurations: cargo, coach, meeting, and lounge. The pods will pick up passengers at gates and travel autonomously to an underground level. There, they will be loaded inside a transporter capsule. Each transporter capsule will carry four pods.The capsules will be propelled by compressed air using magnetic levitation, which eliminates friction, inside a tube kept at a near-vacuum, to eliminate air resistance. They can travel at a speed up to 1,200 km per hour. The Hyperloop will reduce the normal two-hour travel time by car between Abu Dhabi to Dubai to just 12 minutes.The capsules will stop at the Hyperportal upon arrival, while the autonomous pods can either stop at the gates or continue beyond the Hyperportal to take the passengers to destinations in the city.Hyperloop One said in a press release that the infrastructure does not have to work with the pods alone and could work with other self-driving vehicles in the future.]]></description>

      <title>Private German moon mission plans to inspect Apollo 17 lunar rover</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A team of scientists in Germany has developed a lunar rover that will soon fly to the moon and visit the legendary Apollo 17 Lunar Rover Vehicle.The rover is developed by the team called PTScientists, in collaboration with automaker Audi. Dubbed Audi Lunar Quattro, the rover is made of aluminium and titanium, and created almost entirely from 3D printing technology. It is equipped with 4-wheel drive technology, solar panels, rechargeable lithium ion batteries, as well as science-grade high-definition cameras.Two rovers will be carried by the ALINA spacecraft, which stands for the Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module. ALINA will also carry several other payloads, including a lunar plant growth experiment. It has not been confirmed, but a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is reportedly will likely be used to transport the rovers into space.ALINA will touch down about 5 km from the Apollo 17 in the Taurus-Littrow valley. After landing on the moon, the two rovers will be deployed and will travel toward the Apollo 17 lunar rover. However, they are not allowed any closer than 200 meters of the Apollo rover, per NASA’s request. The rovers will send live HD pictures of the Apollo rover to Earth.]]></description>

      <title>Trump-Taiwan phone call controversy and Taiwan-China relations explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took one phone call from Taiwan and everybody lost their minds.But why?The congratulatory phone call U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took from Taiwan last week was a surprise to politicians and press, as his staff to downplayed the political implications of the conversation.The widespread reaction to the call has left many members of the public wondering why a conversation with Taiwan’s president would be so controversial.Civil war in 1927 that involved Communist revolutionaries led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalist government led to the Nationalists feat in 1949. They fled to Taiwan, where they kept control of their forces. Fighting ceased, with the two sides being ruled separately. However, both sides continued to claim authority over all of China.China has maintained that Taiwan is a breakaway province and that the two sides will eventually unify. Meanwhile, the Taiwan-based government at the time declared mainland China was being controlled by illegitimate Communist rebels.The Nationalists were originally recognized by the United States and its allies as China’s rightful rulers, with the government in Taiwan taking China’s seat in the United Nations. However,  Beijing eventually took over Taiwan’s seat, and when the U.S. eventually switched recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 1979, many other countries followed its lead.Taiwan, now a democratic sovereignty, cannot reintegrate with China, as many of its people have said they will not surrender their freedoms. China has also threatened any declaration of independence with military force.Although tension between the two sides continues, Taiwan and China have increased cooperation over the years in the forms of postal, trade and transportation links.The U.S. passed a law requiring the government provide Taiwan with defensive weapons in case of potential aggression from China. However, to protect the status quo, the U.S. has at the same time maintained that its official policy does not support an independent Taiwan. To keep the peace, the U.S. has retained an ambiguous position of keeping close relations to Taiwan, while refusing to recognize its independence.Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has sent a shockwave to China, as taking her call alongside other foreign leaders’ could be seen as a nod to Taiwan’s sovereign status. However, whether that one phone call signals an actual shift in U.S. policy regarding Taiwan remains to be seen.]]></description>

      <title>Google Lunar X-Prize: Private German moon mission to inspect Apollo 17 lunar rover</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A team of scientists in Germany has developed a lunar rover that will soon fly to the moon and visit the legendary Apollo 17 Lunar Rover Vehicle.The rover is developed by the team called PTScientists, in collaboration with automaker Audi. Dubbed Audi Lunar Quattro, the rover is made of aluminium and titanium, and created almost entirely from 3D printing technology. It is equipped with 4-wheel drive technology, solar panels, rechargeable lithium ion batteries, as well as science-grade high-definition cameras.Two rovers will be carried by the ALINA spacecraft, which stands for the Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module. ALINA will also carry several other payloads, including a lunar plant growth experiment. It has not been confirmed, but a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is reportedly will likely be used to transport the rovers into space.ALINA will touch down about 5 km from the Apollo 17 in the Taurus-Littrow valley. After landing on the moon, the two rovers will be deployed and will travel toward the Apollo 17 lunar rover. However, they are not allowed any closer than 200 meters of the Apollo rover, per NASA’s request. The rovers will send live HD pictures of the Apollo rover to Earth.]]></description>

      <title>JAXA teams with fishing net maker to make took for space debris removal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency has teamed up with a 106-year-old fishing net-making company to create a tether that might be able to help remove space debris.Nitto Seimo has a long history of net-making and invented a knotless net machine in 1925. The knotless net is said to be stronger than the knotted net, as tension is usually concentrated on the knots. The nets are usually used in fishing and other commercial uses.JAXA commissioned Nitto Seimo to make a mesh of metal cables into a 700-meter-long tether to be used in space. The tether will be attached to a relatively large-sized piece of space debris in low Earth orbit, with the other end connected to an electron emitter.The tether collects electrons, which are abundant in near-Earth space, and electrons are projected into space through the emitter. This creates an electric current that flows through the tether. The current generates a Lorentz force on the opposite side of the orbital motion, thus weakening the orbital energy, resulting in a ‘drag force’ that brings the debris into the atmosphere, where it will burn up.This technology will be tested next month. If the test is successful, Nitto Seimo will build a tether as long as 10 kilometers.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge - TomoNews</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Giraffes face threat of extinction after numbers drop by 40% in just 30 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND   Once thought to be abundant in number, giraffes are now in danger of extinction, according to the authors of a report published on Thursday.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.Giraffes, the world’s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.The biggest threats to giraffes’ survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Nuclear football: US president's emergency satchel of nuclear codes will go to Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   The mysterious “nuclear football” that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.The “nuclear football” is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as “Yankee White.” The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the ‘football’ must always be within reach of the president.If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president’s decision.The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country’s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon Go grocery store gets rid of long, tedious checkout lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  Amazon is opening a grocery store in downtown Seattle early next year where customers can make their purchases without waiting in checkout lines.The store, called Amazon Go, allows customers to make purchases without the aid of a cashier.Customers would simply need to download the an app onto their phones, open an Amazon account, and visit the Amazon Go store.Amazon’s promotional video shows how customers are admitted into the store after opening their Amazon Go app and scanning it on the turnstiles. The app generates a QR code that logs the customer into the store’s network and connects to the customer’s Amazon account. This prevents shoplifting as the customer’s identity is recognized and stored.The entire store is equipped with computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning technology. It can automatically detect when products are taken from the shelves and records them in virtual shopping carts. The products are removed from the carts if they are placed back onto the shelves.When leaving the store, customers have to pass through turnstiles equipped with sensors that signal the app to calculate the cost of the purchases. The payment is then charged to the customer’s Amazon account.The pictures shown on the Amazon website suggest that some staff might still be responsible for making ready-to-eat meals or other preparations at the store, but the store would probably not include any cashiers or people to bag groceries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 3.4 million Americans are working as cashiers. The New York Post quoted Britt Beam, president of America’s Research Group  a consumer-behavior research firm  saying that Amazon’s technology might wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery-store staff.]]></description>

      <title>Russian drone sub: New drone can imitate any enemy submarine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon have an ocean-going robotized system at his disposal that can mimic the characteristics of different submarines, making it useful for naval exercises as well as reconnaissance missions.The Surrogat, an autonomous, unmanned submarine powered by lithium-ion batteries  that can operate for 15 to 16 hours at a time, is being developed by military designers from Russia’s Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, Russian news agency TASS reports. The drone measures more than 50 feet long and weighs almost 40 tons, with a maximum diving depth of almost 2,000 feet.It can employ towed sonar arrays to simulate another submarine’s acoustic and electromagnetic fields and imitate both conventional and nuclear submarines.The Surrogat can also be used for underwater terrain mapping and reconnaissance.Military designers claim the drone is simple to operate, with low maintenance and upgrade costs. They are currently in talks with the Russian Navy, and believe there may be interest from foreign customers.]]></description>

      <title>Cameroon to turn human waste to clean power in biogas project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BUEA, CAMEROON  Two towns in Cameroon have installed biogas systems to turn human waste into sustainable energy that can provide fuel and electricity for local communities.The project was initiated by Bioenergy-Cameroon, a non-governmental youth organization. Local students, especially female students, are trained on how to install and maintain innovative technology systems such as solar power and biogas mechanisms.According to Reuters, the system includes a septic tank, which is connected to a bio-digester at individual households. Human waste placed in the septic tank is converted into biogas inside the bio-digesters, which release energy into people’s homes for cooking and lighting.Reuters reports that more than 3,000 households and local schools in the towns of Buea and Bamenda have installed the biogas system. The Center for Environment and Development, an NGO in Cameroon, estimates that the biogas project may reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the vicinity by up to 60 percent.]]></description>

      <title>Hyperloop One to build first Hyperloop System in UAE</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DUBAI, UAE  Los Angeles-based start-up Hyperloop One has signed an agreement with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to build the world’s first Hyperloop system, which will connect Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.The stations for Hyperloop One’s system, called Hyperportals, will be located in the city centers. The Hyperportal in Abu Dhabi will be located near the Etihad Towers, while the one in Dubai will be located near the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.Passengers will travel in pods, which come in four different configurations: cargo, coach, meeting, and lounge. The pods will pick up passengers at gates and travel autonomously to an underground level. There, they will be loaded inside a transporter capsule. Each transporter capsule will carry four pods.The capsules will be propelled by compressed air using magnetic levitation, which eliminates friction, inside a tube kept at a near-vacuum, to eliminate air resistance. They can travel at a speed up to 1,200 km per hour. The Hyperloop will reduce the normal two-hour travel time by car between Abu Dhabi to Dubai to just 12 minutes.The capsules will stop at the Hyperportal upon arrival, while the autonomous pods can either stop at the gates or continue beyond the Hyperportal to take the passengers to destinations in the city.Hyperloop One said in a press release that the infrastructure does not have to work with the pods alone and could work with other self-driving vehicles in the future.]]></description>

      <title>Private German moon mission plans to inspect Apollo 17 lunar rover</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A team of scientists in Germany has developed a lunar rover that will soon fly to the moon and visit the legendary Apollo 17 Lunar Rover Vehicle.The rover is developed by the team called PTScientists, in collaboration with automaker Audi. Dubbed Audi Lunar Quattro, the rover is made of aluminium and titanium, and created almost entirely from 3D printing technology. It is equipped with 4-wheel drive technology, solar panels, rechargeable lithium ion batteries, as well as science-grade high-definition cameras.Two rovers will be carried by the ALINA spacecraft, which stands for the Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module. ALINA will also carry several other payloads, including a lunar plant growth experiment. It has not been confirmed, but a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is reportedly will likely be used to transport the rovers into space.ALINA will touch down about 5 km from the Apollo 17 in the Taurus-Littrow valley. After landing on the moon, the two rovers will be deployed and will travel toward the Apollo 17 lunar rover. However, they are not allowed any closer than 200 meters of the Apollo rover, per NASA’s request. The rovers will send live HD pictures of the Apollo rover to Earth.]]></description>

      <title>Trump-Taiwan phone call controversy and Taiwan-China relations explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took one phone call from Taiwan and everybody lost their minds.But why?The congratulatory phone call U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took from Taiwan last week was a surprise to politicians and press, as his staff to downplayed the political implications of the conversation.The widespread reaction to the call has left many members of the public wondering why a conversation with Taiwan’s president would be so controversial.Civil war in 1927 that involved Communist revolutionaries led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalist government led to the Nationalists feat in 1949. They fled to Taiwan, where they kept control of their forces. Fighting ceased, with the two sides being ruled separately. However, both sides continued to claim authority over all of China.China has maintained that Taiwan is a breakaway province and that the two sides will eventually unify. Meanwhile, the Taiwan-based government at the time declared mainland China was being controlled by illegitimate Communist rebels.The Nationalists were originally recognized by the United States and its allies as China’s rightful rulers, with the government in Taiwan taking China’s seat in the United Nations. However,  Beijing eventually took over Taiwan’s seat, and when the U.S. eventually switched recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 1979, many other countries followed its lead.Taiwan, now a democratic sovereignty, cannot reintegrate with China, as many of its people have said they will not surrender their freedoms. China has also threatened any declaration of independence with military force.Although tension between the two sides continues, Taiwan and China have increased cooperation over the years in the forms of postal, trade and transportation links.The U.S. passed a law requiring the government provide Taiwan with defensive weapons in case of potential aggression from China. However, to protect the status quo, the U.S. has at the same time maintained that its official policy does not support an independent Taiwan. To keep the peace, the U.S. has retained an ambiguous position of keeping close relations to Taiwan, while refusing to recognize its independence.Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has sent a shockwave to China, as taking her call alongside other foreign leaders’ could be seen as a nod to Taiwan’s sovereign status. However, whether that one phone call signals an actual shift in U.S. policy regarding Taiwan remains to be seen.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Space robot: NASA to launch autonomous satellite repair robot Restore-L in summer 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA  In the summer of 2020, NASA will launch the Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft tasked with carrying out maintenance and repair on satellites orbiting earth.NASA awarded a $127 million contract to California-based Space Systems/Loral build Restore-L, reported Vice’s technology news website Motherboard.According to information posted on the Restore-L section of NASA Robotic Servicing Mission website, it will navigate Earth’s orbit using a combination of advanced hardware and algorithms at speeds of over 16,000 miles per hour. This technology will allow it to calculate how to connect with a satellite orbiting the earth at the same speed.Restore-L will use dexterous mechanical arms to service satellites in low earth orbit. This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge - TomoNews</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Giraffes face threat of extinction after numbers drop by 40% in just 30 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND   Once thought to be abundant in number, giraffes are now in danger of extinction, according to the authors of a report published on Thursday.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.Giraffes, the world’s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.The biggest threats to giraffes’ survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Nuclear football: US president's emergency satchel of nuclear codes will go to Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   The mysterious “nuclear football” that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.The “nuclear football” is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as “Yankee White.” The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the ‘football’ must always be within reach of the president.If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president’s decision.The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country’s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  Amazon is opening a grocery store in downtown Seattle early next year where customers can make their purchases without waiting in checkout lines.The store, called Amazon Go, allows customers to make purchases without the aid of a cashier.Customers would simply need to download the an app onto their phones, open an Amazon account, and visit the Amazon Go store.Amazon’s promotional video shows how customers are admitted into the store after opening their Amazon Go app and scanning it on the turnstiles. The app generates a QR code that logs the customer into the store’s network and connects to the customer’s Amazon account. This prevents shoplifting as the customer’s identity is recognized and stored.The entire store is equipped with computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning technology. It can automatically detect when products are taken from the shelves and records them in virtual shopping carts. The products are removed from the carts if they are placed back onto the shelves.When leaving the store, customers have to pass through turnstiles equipped with sensors that signal the app to calculate the cost of the purchases. The payment is then charged to the customer’s Amazon account.The pictures shown on the Amazon website suggest that some staff might still be responsible for making ready-to-eat meals or other preparations at the store, but the store would probably not include any cashiers or people to bag groceries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 3.4 million Americans are working as cashiers. The New York Post quoted Britt Beam, president of America’s Research Group  a consumer-behavior research firm  saying that Amazon’s technology might wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery-store staff.]]></description>

      <title>Russian drone sub: New drone can imitate any enemy submarine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon have an ocean-going robotized system at his disposal that can mimic the characteristics of different submarines, making it useful for naval exercises as well as reconnaissance missions.The Surrogat, an autonomous, unmanned submarine powered by lithium-ion batteries  that can operate for 15 to 16 hours at a time, is being developed by military designers from Russia’s Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, Russian news agency TASS reports. The drone measures more than 50 feet long and weighs almost 40 tons, with a maximum diving depth of almost 2,000 feet.It can employ towed sonar arrays to simulate another submarine’s acoustic and electromagnetic fields and imitate both conventional and nuclear submarines.The Surrogat can also be used for underwater terrain mapping and reconnaissance.Military designers claim the drone is simple to operate, with low maintenance and upgrade costs. They are currently in talks with the Russian Navy, and believe there may be interest from foreign customers.]]></description>

      <title>Cameroon to turn human waste to clean power in biogas project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BUEA, CAMEROON  Two towns in Cameroon have installed biogas systems to turn human waste into sustainable energy that can provide fuel and electricity for local communities.The project was initiated by Bioenergy-Cameroon, a non-governmental youth organization. Local students, especially female students, are trained on how to install and maintain innovative technology systems such as solar power and biogas mechanisms.According to Reuters, the system includes a septic tank, which is connected to a bio-digester at individual households. Human waste placed in the septic tank is converted into biogas inside the bio-digesters, which release energy into people’s homes for cooking and lighting.Reuters reports that more than 3,000 households and local schools in the towns of Buea and Bamenda have installed the biogas system. The Center for Environment and Development, an NGO in Cameroon, estimates that the biogas project may reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the vicinity by up to 60 percent.]]></description>

      <title>Hyperloop One to build first Hyperloop System in UAE</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DUBAI, UAE  Los Angeles-based start-up Hyperloop One has signed an agreement with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to build the world’s first Hyperloop system, which will connect Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.The stations for Hyperloop One’s system, called Hyperportals, will be located in the city centers. The Hyperportal in Abu Dhabi will be located near the Etihad Towers, while the one in Dubai will be located near the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.Passengers will travel in pods, which come in four different configurations: cargo, coach, meeting, and lounge. The pods will pick up passengers at gates and travel autonomously to an underground level. There, they will be loaded inside a transporter capsule. Each transporter capsule will carry four pods.The capsules will be propelled by compressed air using magnetic levitation, which eliminates friction, inside a tube kept at a near-vacuum, to eliminate air resistance. They can travel at a speed up to 1,200 km per hour. The Hyperloop will reduce the normal two-hour travel time by car between Abu Dhabi to Dubai to just 12 minutes.The capsules will stop at the Hyperportal upon arrival, while the autonomous pods can either stop at the gates or continue beyond the Hyperportal to take the passengers to destinations in the city.Hyperloop One said in a press release that the infrastructure does not have to work with the pods alone and could work with other self-driving vehicles in the future.]]></description>

      <title>Private German moon mission plans to inspect Apollo 17 lunar rover</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A team of scientists in Germany has developed a lunar rover that will soon fly to the moon and visit the legendary Apollo 17 Lunar Rover Vehicle.The rover is developed by the team called PTScientists, in collaboration with automaker Audi. Dubbed Audi Lunar Quattro, the rover is made of aluminium and titanium, and created almost entirely from 3D printing technology. It is equipped with 4-wheel drive technology, solar panels, rechargeable lithium ion batteries, as well as science-grade high-definition cameras.Two rovers will be carried by the ALINA spacecraft, which stands for the Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module. ALINA will also carry several other payloads, including a lunar plant growth experiment. It has not been confirmed, but a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is reportedly will likely be used to transport the rovers into space.ALINA will touch down about 5 km from the Apollo 17 in the Taurus-Littrow valley. After landing on the moon, the two rovers will be deployed and will travel toward the Apollo 17 lunar rover. However, they are not allowed any closer than 200 meters of the Apollo rover, per NASA’s request. The rovers will send live HD pictures of the Apollo rover to Earth.]]></description>

      <title>Trump-Taiwan phone call controversy and Taiwan-China relations explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took one phone call from Taiwan and everybody lost their minds.But why?The congratulatory phone call U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took from Taiwan last week was a surprise to politicians and press, as his staff to downplayed the political implications of the conversation.The widespread reaction to the call has left many members of the public wondering why a conversation with Taiwan’s president would be so controversial.Civil war in 1927 that involved Communist revolutionaries led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalist government led to the Nationalists feat in 1949. They fled to Taiwan, where they kept control of their forces. Fighting ceased, with the two sides being ruled separately. However, both sides continued to claim authority over all of China.China has maintained that Taiwan is a breakaway province and that the two sides will eventually unify. Meanwhile, the Taiwan-based government at the time declared mainland China was being controlled by illegitimate Communist rebels.The Nationalists were originally recognized by the United States and its allies as China’s rightful rulers, with the government in Taiwan taking China’s seat in the United Nations. However,  Beijing eventually took over Taiwan’s seat, and when the U.S. eventually switched recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 1979, many other countries followed its lead.Taiwan, now a democratic sovereignty, cannot reintegrate with China, as many of its people have said they will not surrender their freedoms. China has also threatened any declaration of independence with military force.Although tension between the two sides continues, Taiwan and China have increased cooperation over the years in the forms of postal, trade and transportation links.The U.S. passed a law requiring the government provide Taiwan with defensive weapons in case of potential aggression from China. However, to protect the status quo, the U.S. has at the same time maintained that its official policy does not support an independent Taiwan. To keep the peace, the U.S. has retained an ambiguous position of keeping close relations to Taiwan, while refusing to recognize its independence.Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has sent a shockwave to China, as taking her call alongside other foreign leaders’ could be seen as a nod to Taiwan’s sovereign status. However, whether that one phone call signals an actual shift in U.S. policy regarding Taiwan remains to be seen.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>Russian ambassador shot dead by off-duty Turkish cop in Ankara</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>Jordan attack: Canadian woman among 10 killed in terrorist siege of Karak castle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List.

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Giraffes face threat of extinction after numbers drop by 40% in just 30 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND   Once thought to be abundant in number, giraffes are now in danger of extinction, according to the authors of a report published on Thursday.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.Giraffes, the world’s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.The biggest threats to giraffes’ survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Nuclear football: US president's emergency satchel of nuclear codes will go to Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   The mysterious “nuclear football” that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.The “nuclear football” is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as “Yankee White.” The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the ‘football’ must always be within reach of the president.If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president’s decision.The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country’s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon Go grocery store gets rid of long, tedious checkout lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  Amazon is opening a grocery store in downtown Seattle early next year where customers can make their purchases without waiting in checkout lines.The store, called Amazon Go, allows customers to make purchases without the aid of a cashier.Customers would simply need to download the an app onto their phones, open an Amazon account, and visit the Amazon Go store.Amazon’s promotional video shows how customers are admitted into the store after opening their Amazon Go app and scanning it on the turnstiles. The app generates a QR code that logs the customer into the store’s network and connects to the customer’s Amazon account. This prevents shoplifting as the customer’s identity is recognized and stored.The entire store is equipped with computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning technology. It can automatically detect when products are taken from the shelves and records them in virtual shopping carts. The products are removed from the carts if they are placed back onto the shelves.When leaving the store, customers have to pass through turnstiles equipped with sensors that signal the app to calculate the cost of the purchases. The payment is then charged to the customer’s Amazon account.The pictures shown on the Amazon website suggest that some staff might still be responsible for making ready-to-eat meals or other preparations at the store, but the store would probably not include any cashiers or people to bag groceries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 3.4 million Americans are working as cashiers. The New York Post quoted Britt Beam, president of America’s Research Group  a consumer-behavior research firm  saying that Amazon’s technology might wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery-store staff.]]></description>

      <title>Russian drone sub: New drone can imitate any enemy submarine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon have an ocean-going robotized system at his disposal that can mimic the characteristics of different submarines, making it useful for naval exercises as well as reconnaissance missions.The Surrogat, an autonomous, unmanned submarine powered by lithium-ion batteries  that can operate for 15 to 16 hours at a time, is being developed by military designers from Russia’s Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, Russian news agency TASS reports. The drone measures more than 50 feet long and weighs almost 40 tons, with a maximum diving depth of almost 2,000 feet.It can employ towed sonar arrays to simulate another submarine’s acoustic and electromagnetic fields and imitate both conventional and nuclear submarines.The Surrogat can also be used for underwater terrain mapping and reconnaissance.Military designers claim the drone is simple to operate, with low maintenance and upgrade costs. They are currently in talks with the Russian Navy, and believe there may be interest from foreign customers.]]></description>

      <title>Cameroon to turn human waste to clean power in biogas project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BUEA, CAMEROON  Two towns in Cameroon have installed biogas systems to turn human waste into sustainable energy that can provide fuel and electricity for local communities.The project was initiated by Bioenergy-Cameroon, a non-governmental youth organization. Local students, especially female students, are trained on how to install and maintain innovative technology systems such as solar power and biogas mechanisms.According to Reuters, the system includes a septic tank, which is connected to a bio-digester at individual households. Human waste placed in the septic tank is converted into biogas inside the bio-digesters, which release energy into people’s homes for cooking and lighting.Reuters reports that more than 3,000 households and local schools in the towns of Buea and Bamenda have installed the biogas system. The Center for Environment and Development, an NGO in Cameroon, estimates that the biogas project may reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the vicinity by up to 60 percent.]]></description>

      <title>Hyperloop One to build first Hyperloop System in UAE</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DUBAI, UAE  Los Angeles-based start-up Hyperloop One has signed an agreement with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to build the world’s first Hyperloop system, which will connect Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.The stations for Hyperloop One’s system, called Hyperportals, will be located in the city centers. The Hyperportal in Abu Dhabi will be located near the Etihad Towers, while the one in Dubai will be located near the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.Passengers will travel in pods, which come in four different configurations: cargo, coach, meeting, and lounge. The pods will pick up passengers at gates and travel autonomously to an underground level. There, they will be loaded inside a transporter capsule. Each transporter capsule will carry four pods.The capsules will be propelled by compressed air using magnetic levitation, which eliminates friction, inside a tube kept at a near-vacuum, to eliminate air resistance. They can travel at a speed up to 1,200 km per hour. The Hyperloop will reduce the normal two-hour travel time by car between Abu Dhabi to Dubai to just 12 minutes.The capsules will stop at the Hyperportal upon arrival, while the autonomous pods can either stop at the gates or continue beyond the Hyperportal to take the passengers to destinations in the city.Hyperloop One said in a press release that the infrastructure does not have to work with the pods alone and could work with other self-driving vehicles in the future.]]></description>

It is equipped with 4-wheel drive technology, solar panels, rechargeable lithium ion batteries, as well as science-grade high-definition cameras.Two rovers will be carried by the ALINA spacecraft, which stands for the Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module. ALINA will also carry several other payloads, including a lunar plant growth experiment. It has not been confirmed, but a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is reportedly will likely be used to transport the rovers into space.ALINA will touch down about 5 km from the Apollo 17 in the Taurus-Littrow valley. After landing on the moon, the two rovers will be deployed and will travel toward the Apollo 17 lunar rover. However, they are not allowed any closer than 200 meters of the Apollo rover, per NASA’s request. The rovers will send live HD pictures of the Apollo rover to Earth.]]></description>

      <title>Trump-Taiwan phone call controversy and Taiwan-China relations explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took one phone call from Taiwan and everybody lost their minds.But why?The congratulatory phone call U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took from Taiwan last week was a surprise to politicians and press, as his staff to downplayed the political implications of the conversation.The widespread reaction to the call has left many members of the public wondering why a conversation with Taiwan’s president would be so controversial.Civil war in 1927 that involved Communist revolutionaries led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalist government led to the Nationalists feat in 1949. They fled to Taiwan, where they kept control of their forces. Fighting ceased, with the two sides being ruled separately. However, both sides continued to claim authority over all of China.China has maintained that Taiwan is a breakaway province and that the two sides will eventually unify. Meanwhile, the Taiwan-based government at the time declared mainland China was being controlled by illegitimate Communist rebels.The Nationalists were originally recognized by the United States and its allies as China’s rightful rulers, with the government in Taiwan taking China’s seat in the United Nations. However,  Beijing eventually took over Taiwan’s seat, and when the U.S. eventually switched recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 1979, many other countries followed its lead.Taiwan, now a democratic sovereignty, cannot reintegrate with China, as many of its people have said they will not surrender their freedoms. China has also threatened any declaration of independence with military force.Although tension between the two sides continues, Taiwan and China have increased cooperation over the years in the forms of postal, trade and transportation links.The U.S. passed a law requiring the government provide Taiwan with defensive weapons in case of potential aggression from China. However, to protect the status quo, the U.S. has at the same time maintained that its official policy does not support an independent Taiwan. To keep the peace, the U.S. has retained an ambiguous position of keeping close relations to Taiwan, while refusing to recognize its independence.Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has sent a shockwave to China, as taking her call alongside other foreign leaders’ could be seen as a nod to Taiwan’s sovereign status. However, whether that one phone call signals an actual shift in U.S. policy regarding Taiwan remains to be seen.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Space robot: NASA to launch autonomous satellite repair robot Restore-L in summer 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA  In the summer of 2020, NASA will launch the Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft tasked with carrying out maintenance and repair on satellites orbiting earth.NASA awarded a $127 million contract to California-based Space Systems/Loral build Restore-L, reported Vice’s technology news website Motherboard.According to information posted on the Restore-L section of NASA Robotic Servicing Mission website, it will navigate Earth’s orbit using a combination of advanced hardware and algorithms at speeds of over 16,000 miles per hour. This technology will allow it to calculate how to connect with a satellite orbiting the earth at the same speed.Restore-L will use dexterous mechanical arms to service satellites in low earth orbit. This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>Russian ambassador shot dead by off-duty Turkish cop in Ankara</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>Jordan attack: Canadian woman among 10 killed in terrorist siege of Karak castle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND   Once thought to be abundant in number, giraffes are now in danger of extinction, according to the authors of a report published on Thursday.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.Giraffes, the world’s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.The biggest threats to giraffes’ survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Nuclear football: US president's emergency satchel of nuclear codes will go to Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   The mysterious “nuclear football” that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.The “nuclear football” is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as “Yankee White.” The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the ‘football’ must always be within reach of the president.If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president’s decision.The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country’s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon Go grocery store gets rid of long, tedious checkout lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  Amazon is opening a grocery store in downtown Seattle early next year where customers can make their purchases without waiting in checkout lines.The store, called Amazon Go, allows customers to make purchases without the aid of a cashier.Customers would simply need to download the an app onto their phones, open an Amazon account, and visit the Amazon Go store.Amazon’s promotional video shows how customers are admitted into the store after opening their Amazon Go app and scanning it on the turnstiles. The app generates a QR code that logs the customer into the store’s network and connects to the customer’s Amazon account. This prevents shoplifting as the customer’s identity is recognized and stored.The entire store is equipped with computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning technology. It can automatically detect when products are taken from the shelves and records them in virtual shopping carts. The products are removed from the carts if they are placed back onto the shelves.When leaving the store, customers have to pass through turnstiles equipped with sensors that signal the app to calculate the cost of the purchases. The payment is then charged to the customer’s Amazon account.The pictures shown on the Amazon website suggest that some staff might still be responsible for making ready-to-eat meals or other preparations at the store, but the store would probably not include any cashiers or people to bag groceries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 3.4 million Americans are working as cashiers. The New York Post quoted Britt Beam, president of America’s Research Group  a consumer-behavior research firm  saying that Amazon’s technology might wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery-store staff.]]></description>

      <title>Russian drone sub: New drone can imitate any enemy submarine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon have an ocean-going robotized system at his disposal that can mimic the characteristics of different submarines, making it useful for naval exercises as well as reconnaissance missions.The Surrogat, an autonomous, unmanned submarine powered by lithium-ion batteries  that can operate for 15 to 16 hours at a time, is being developed by military designers from Russia’s Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, Russian news agency TASS reports. The drone measures more than 50 feet long and weighs almost 40 tons, with a maximum diving depth of almost 2,000 feet.It can employ towed sonar arrays to simulate another submarine’s acoustic and electromagnetic fields and imitate both conventional and nuclear submarines.The Surrogat can also be used for underwater terrain mapping and reconnaissance.Military designers claim the drone is simple to operate, with low maintenance and upgrade costs. They are currently in talks with the Russian Navy, and believe there may be interest from foreign customers.]]></description>

      <title>Cameroon to turn human waste to clean power in biogas project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BUEA, CAMEROON  Two towns in Cameroon have installed biogas systems to turn human waste into sustainable energy that can provide fuel and electricity for local communities.The project was initiated by Bioenergy-Cameroon, a non-governmental youth organization. Local students, especially female students, are trained on how to install and maintain innovative technology systems such as solar power and biogas mechanisms.According to Reuters, the system includes a septic tank, which is connected to a bio-digester at individual households. Human waste placed in the septic tank is converted into biogas inside the bio-digesters, which release energy into people’s homes for cooking and lighting.Reuters reports that more than 3,000 households and local schools in the towns of Buea and Bamenda have installed the biogas system. The Center for Environment and Development, an NGO in Cameroon, estimates that the biogas project may reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the vicinity by up to 60 percent.]]></description>

      <title>Hyperloop One to build first Hyperloop System in UAE</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DUBAI, UAE  Los Angeles-based start-up Hyperloop One has signed an agreement with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to build the world’s first Hyperloop system, which will connect Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.The stations for Hyperloop One’s system, called Hyperportals, will be located in the city centers. The Hyperportal in Abu Dhabi will be located near the Etihad Towers, while the one in Dubai will be located near the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.Passengers will travel in pods, which come in four different configurations: cargo, coach, meeting, and lounge. The pods will pick up passengers at gates and travel autonomously to an underground level. There, they will be loaded inside a transporter capsule. Each transporter capsule will carry four pods.The capsules will be propelled by compressed air using magnetic levitation, which eliminates friction, inside a tube kept at a near-vacuum, to eliminate air resistance. They can travel at a speed up to 1,200 km per hour. The Hyperloop will reduce the normal two-hour travel time by car between Abu Dhabi to Dubai to just 12 minutes.The capsules will stop at the Hyperportal upon arrival, while the autonomous pods can either stop at the gates or continue beyond the Hyperportal to take the passengers to destinations in the city.Hyperloop One said in a press release that the infrastructure does not have to work with the pods alone and could work with other self-driving vehicles in the future.]]></description>

      <title>Private German moon mission plans to inspect Apollo 17 lunar rover</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A team of scientists in Germany has developed a lunar rover that will soon fly to the moon and visit the legendary Apollo 17 Lunar Rover Vehicle.The rover is developed by the team called PTScientists, in collaboration with automaker Audi. Dubbed Audi Lunar Quattro, the rover is made of aluminium and titanium, and created almost entirely from 3D printing technology. It is equipped with 4-wheel drive technology, solar panels, rechargeable lithium ion batteries, as well as science-grade high-definition cameras.Two rovers will be carried by the ALINA spacecraft, which stands for the Autonomous Landing and Navigation Module. ALINA will also carry several other payloads, including a lunar plant growth experiment. It has not been confirmed, but a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is reportedly will likely be used to transport the rovers into space.ALINA will touch down about 5 km from the Apollo 17 in the Taurus-Littrow valley. After landing on the moon, the two rovers will be deployed and will travel toward the Apollo 17 lunar rover. However, they are not allowed any closer than 200 meters of the Apollo rover, per NASA’s request. The rovers will send live HD pictures of the Apollo rover to Earth.]]></description>

      <title>Trump-Taiwan phone call controversy and Taiwan-China relations explained</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took one phone call from Taiwan and everybody lost their minds.But why?The congratulatory phone call U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took from Taiwan last week was a surprise to politicians and press, as his staff to downplayed the political implications of the conversation.The widespread reaction to the call has left many members of the public wondering why a conversation with Taiwan’s president would be so controversial.Civil war in 1927 that involved Communist revolutionaries led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalist government led to the Nationalists feat in 1949. They fled to Taiwan, where they kept control of their forces. Fighting ceased, with the two sides being ruled separately. However, both sides continued to claim authority over all of China.China has maintained that Taiwan is a breakaway province and that the two sides will eventually unify. Meanwhile, the Taiwan-based government at the time declared mainland China was being controlled by illegitimate Communist rebels.The Nationalists were originally recognized by the United States and its allies as China’s rightful rulers, with the government in Taiwan taking China’s seat in the United Nations. However,  Beijing eventually took over Taiwan’s seat, and when the U.S. eventually switched recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 1979, many other countries followed its lead.Taiwan, now a democratic sovereignty, cannot reintegrate with China, as many of its people have said they will not surrender their freedoms. China has also threatened any declaration of independence with military force.Although tension between the two sides continues, Taiwan and China have increased cooperation over the years in the forms of postal, trade and transportation links.The U.S. passed a law requiring the government provide Taiwan with defensive weapons in case of potential aggression from China. However, to protect the status quo, the U.S. has at the same time maintained that its official policy does not support an independent Taiwan. To keep the peace, the U.S. has retained an ambiguous position of keeping close relations to Taiwan, while refusing to recognize its independence.Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has sent a shockwave to China, as taking her call alongside other foreign leaders’ could be seen as a nod to Taiwan’s sovereign status. However, whether that one phone call signals an actual shift in U.S. policy regarding Taiwan remains to be seen.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen.

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Giraffes face threat of extinction after numbers drop by 40% in just 30 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND   Once thought to be abundant in number, giraffes are now in danger of extinction, according to the authors of a report published on Thursday.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.Giraffes, the world’s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.The biggest threats to giraffes’ survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Nuclear football: US president's emergency satchel of nuclear codes will go to Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   The mysterious “nuclear football” that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.The “nuclear football” is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as “Yankee White.” The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the ‘football’ must always be within reach of the president.If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president’s decision.The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country’s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon Go grocery store gets rid of long, tedious checkout lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  Amazon is opening a grocery store in downtown Seattle early next year where customers can make their purchases without waiting in checkout lines.The store, called Amazon Go, allows customers to make purchases without the aid of a cashier.Customers would simply need to download the an app onto their phones, open an Amazon account, and visit the Amazon Go store.Amazon’s promotional video shows how customers are admitted into the store after opening their Amazon Go app and scanning it on the turnstiles. The app generates a QR code that logs the customer into the store’s network and connects to the customer’s Amazon account. This prevents shoplifting as the customer’s identity is recognized and stored.The entire store is equipped with computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning technology. It can automatically detect when products are taken from the shelves and records them in virtual shopping carts. The products are removed from the carts if they are placed back onto the shelves.When leaving the store, customers have to pass through turnstiles equipped with sensors that signal the app to calculate the cost of the purchases. The payment is then charged to the customer’s Amazon account.The pictures shown on the Amazon website suggest that some staff might still be responsible for making ready-to-eat meals or other preparations at the store, but the store would probably not include any cashiers or people to bag groceries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 3.4 million Americans are working as cashiers. The New York Post quoted Britt Beam, president of America’s Research Group  a consumer-behavior research firm  saying that Amazon’s technology might wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery-store staff.]]></description>

      <title>Russian drone sub: New drone can imitate any enemy submarine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon have an ocean-going robotized system at his disposal that can mimic the characteristics of different submarines, making it useful for naval exercises as well as reconnaissance missions.The Surrogat, an autonomous, unmanned submarine powered by lithium-ion batteries  that can operate for 15 to 16 hours at a time, is being developed by military designers from Russia’s Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, Russian news agency TASS reports. The drone measures more than 50 feet long and weighs almost 40 tons, with a maximum diving depth of almost 2,000 feet.It can employ towed sonar arrays to simulate another submarine’s acoustic and electromagnetic fields and imitate both conventional and nuclear submarines.The Surrogat can also be used for underwater terrain mapping and reconnaissance.Military designers claim the drone is simple to operate, with low maintenance and upgrade costs. They are currently in talks with the Russian Navy, and believe there may be interest from foreign customers.]]></description>

      <title>Cameroon to turn human waste to clean power in biogas project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BUEA, CAMEROON  Two towns in Cameroon have installed biogas systems to turn human waste into sustainable energy that can provide fuel and electricity for local communities.The project was initiated by Bioenergy-Cameroon, a non-governmental youth organization. Local students, especially female students, are trained on how to install and maintain innovative technology systems such as solar power and biogas mechanisms.According to Reuters, the system includes a septic tank, which is connected to a bio-digester at individual households. Human waste placed in the septic tank is converted into biogas inside the bio-digesters, which release energy into people’s homes for cooking and lighting.Reuters reports that more than 3,000 households and local schools in the towns of Buea and Bamenda have installed the biogas system. The Center for Environment and Development, an NGO in Cameroon, estimates that the biogas project may reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the vicinity by up to 60 percent.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Space robot: NASA to launch autonomous satellite repair robot Restore-L in summer 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA  In the summer of 2020, NASA will launch the Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft tasked with carrying out maintenance and repair on satellites orbiting earth.NASA awarded a $127 million contract to California-based Space Systems/Loral build Restore-L, reported Vice’s technology news website Motherboard.According to information posted on the Restore-L section of NASA Robotic Servicing Mission website, it will navigate Earth’s orbit using a combination of advanced hardware and algorithms at speeds of over 16,000 miles per hour. This technology will allow it to calculate how to connect with a satellite orbiting the earth at the same speed.Restore-L will use dexterous mechanical arms to service satellites in low earth orbit. This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>Russian ambassador shot dead by off-duty Turkish cop in Ankara</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>Jordan attack: Canadian woman among 10 killed in terrorist siege of Karak castle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND   Once thought to be abundant in number, giraffes are now in danger of extinction, according to the authors of a report published on Thursday.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.Giraffes, the world’s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.The biggest threats to giraffes’ survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Nuclear football: US president's emergency satchel of nuclear codes will go to Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   The mysterious “nuclear football” that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.The “nuclear football” is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as “Yankee White.” The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the ‘football’ must always be within reach of the president.If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president’s decision.The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country’s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon Go grocery store gets rid of long, tedious checkout lines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  Amazon is opening a grocery store in downtown Seattle early next year where customers can make their purchases without waiting in checkout lines.The store, called Amazon Go, allows customers to make purchases without the aid of a cashier.Customers would simply need to download the an app onto their phones, open an Amazon account, and visit the Amazon Go store.Amazon’s promotional video shows how customers are admitted into the store after opening their Amazon Go app and scanning it on the turnstiles. The app generates a QR code that logs the customer into the store’s network and connects to the customer’s Amazon account. This prevents shoplifting as the customer’s identity is recognized and stored.The entire store is equipped with computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning technology. It can automatically detect when products are taken from the shelves and records them in virtual shopping carts. The products are removed from the carts if they are placed back onto the shelves.When leaving the store, customers have to pass through turnstiles equipped with sensors that signal the app to calculate the cost of the purchases. The payment is then charged to the customer’s Amazon account.The pictures shown on the Amazon website suggest that some staff might still be responsible for making ready-to-eat meals or other preparations at the store, but the store would probably not include any cashiers or people to bag groceries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 3.4 million Americans are working as cashiers. The New York Post quoted Britt Beam, president of America’s Research Group  a consumer-behavior research firm  saying that Amazon’s technology might wipe out 75 percent of typical grocery-store staff.]]></description>

      <title>Russian drone sub: New drone can imitate any enemy submarine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon have an ocean-going robotized system at his disposal that can mimic the characteristics of different submarines, making it useful for naval exercises as well as reconnaissance missions.The Surrogat, an autonomous, unmanned submarine powered by lithium-ion batteries  that can operate for 15 to 16 hours at a time, is being developed by military designers from Russia’s Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, Russian news agency TASS reports. The drone measures more than 50 feet long and weighs almost 40 tons, with a maximum diving depth of almost 2,000 feet.It can employ towed sonar arrays to simulate another submarine’s acoustic and electromagnetic fields and imitate both conventional and nuclear submarines.The Surrogat can also be used for underwater terrain mapping and reconnaissance.Military designers claim the drone is simple to operate, with low maintenance and upgrade costs. They are currently in talks with the Russian Navy, and believe there may be interest from foreign customers.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>Russian ambassador shot dead by off-duty Turkish cop in Ankara</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>Jordan attack: Canadian woman among 10 killed in terrorist siege of Karak castle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List.

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Giraffes face threat of extinction after numbers drop by 40% in just 30 years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND   Once thought to be abundant in number, giraffes are now in danger of extinction, according to the authors of a report published on Thursday.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.Giraffes, the world’s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.The biggest threats to giraffes’ survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Nuclear football: US president's emergency satchel of nuclear codes will go to Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   The mysterious “nuclear football” that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.The “nuclear football” is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as “Yankee White.” The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the ‘football’ must always be within reach of the president.If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president’s decision.The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country’s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Russia to build futuristic nuclear-powered icebreaker to keep Northern Sea Route open</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Space robot: NASA to launch autonomous satellite repair robot Restore-L in summer 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA  In the summer of 2020, NASA will launch the Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft tasked with carrying out maintenance and repair on satellites orbiting earth.NASA awarded a $127 million contract to California-based Space Systems/Loral build Restore-L, reported Vice’s technology news website Motherboard.According to information posted on the Restore-L section of NASA Robotic Servicing Mission website, it will navigate Earth’s orbit using a combination of advanced hardware and algorithms at speeds of over 16,000 miles per hour. This technology will allow it to calculate how to connect with a satellite orbiting the earth at the same speed.Restore-L will use dexterous mechanical arms to service satellites in low earth orbit. This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>Jordan attack: Canadian woman among 10 killed in terrorist siege of Karak castle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy hair loss solution: scalp cooling cap may reduce hair loss from chemo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Attempted murder caught on camera: California man charged for shooting of U.S. diplomat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Russia to build futuristic nuclear-powered icebreaker to keep Northern Sea Route open</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus.

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Polar bears in danger: Global warming will wipe one third of polar bears out by 2050</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GLAND, SWITZERLAND  Polar bear numbers could drop by a third over the next 35 years because of global warming.The warning comes in a study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), phys.org reported.The global polar bear population is estimated to stand at 26,000. The study suggests there is a 70 percent chance that figure will drop 30 percent by 2050.Melting sea ice caused by global warming is the main threat to the survival of polar bears. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a floating platform to hunt seals, which can outswim them in the water.The presence of manmade chemicals in the food chain is another major threat to polar bear numbers.The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organisation classifies polar bears as “vulnerable,” meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may not have to suffer hair loss anymore, thanks to a ‘cooling cap’ technology.Chemotherapy drugs are designed to attack rapidly dividing cells, and as both cancer cells and hair cells divide rapidly, chemotherapy can cause damage to hair cells, which leads to hair loss.A cooling cap system was developed by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine. The system can lower the scalp temperature to about 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The low temperature constricts the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the area by up to 40 percent. Less blood flow to the scalp means fewer chemotherapy drugs can attack the hair cells.“Hair loss takes a tremendous toll on the patient’s body image, and they no longer have the anonymity of hiding the disease; everyone can see that they’re sick,” Julie Nangia, assistant professor in the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center at Baylor College of Medicine said in a press release. Researchers say the cooling caps should work on patients with solid tumors, but will not work for patients with leukemia or blood cancers.]]></description>

      <title>South China Sea dispute: Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA  Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam’s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China’s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China’s runway and military installations.]]></description>

      <title>Border patrol: 150 extra agents deployed in South Texas after illegal immigration surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EDINBURG, TEXAS  Migrants trying to get into the U.S. are doing so in droves recently. One border patrol veteran said it’s because immigrants are worried Trump will start building his wall once he is sworn into office in January.CNN reports that recent months have seen an increase in the number of people caught illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico, from 37,048 in August, and 39,501 in September, to 46,195 in October.Detention facilities that used to see 31 to 34,000 individuals on average are now holding 41,000, most of them families and unaccompanied children.As a result, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has announced in a press release that it plans to send an extra 150 agents from Tucson, Arizona, and San Diego and Del Rio, Texas to processing centers near the border. They will be stationed there temporarily, for around two months.These agents will be screening and classifying the undocumented migrants in the McAllen and Weslaco centers, in effect freeing up local agents to focus on border security.A similar surge occurred in the South Texas border in 2014, after hundreds of thousands of migrants escaped Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to seek refuge in the US, reports Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Hackers can copy fingerprints from photos, steal your identity with peace sign selfies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Space robot: NASA to launch autonomous satellite repair robot Restore-L in summer 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA  In the summer of 2020, NASA will launch the Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft tasked with carrying out maintenance and repair on satellites orbiting earth.NASA awarded a $127 million contract to California-based Space Systems/Loral build Restore-L, reported Vice’s technology news website Motherboard.According to information posted on the Restore-L section of NASA Robotic Servicing Mission website, it will navigate Earth’s orbit using a combination of advanced hardware and algorithms at speeds of over 16,000 miles per hour. This technology will allow it to calculate how to connect with a satellite orbiting the earth at the same speed.Restore-L will use dexterous mechanical arms to service satellites in low earth orbit. This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Attempted murder caught on camera: California man charged for shooting of U.S. diplomat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday.

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>Russian ambassador shot dead by off-duty Turkish cop in Ankara</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>Jordan attack: Canadian woman among 10 killed in terrorist siege of Karak castle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Faithless electors: electors voting against their pledge aim to stop Trump&#x2019;s America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  With only a week left until the Electoral College makes U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s win official, a handful of rogues will be voting against their pledge in hopes of derailing a Trump presidency.For most states, the candidate that wins the majority vote in a state gets all of its electoral votes. In Maine and Nebraska, the votes are tallied by congressional district. Each state is allocated a certain number of electors, for a current total of 538, which makes up the Electoral College.According to the National Archives and Records Administration, on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, electors convene in their states to cast the votes for the president and vice president.But sometimes, electors who are bound to vote for a presidential candidate choose not to do so. Called faithless electors, these members either pick a different candidate or abstain from voting altogether.To prevent this from happening, 29 states plus the District of Columbia legally bind their electors to their pledged vote, under threat of a misdemeanor charge or a fine.A group of rogues who call themselves Hamilton electors are currently trying to deny Trump his presidency, but they need to convince at least 37 Republican electors to turn in order to successfully do so.Faithless electors rarely alter the outcome of the electoral vote, except for one instance in 1836, when 23 Virginia electors abstained in voting for the vice presidential nominee.In the event of a deadlock, or if no candidate gets the absolute majority of votes, a contingent election is held where the presidency is decided by the House of Representatives and the vice presidency by the Senate.At this point, whether or not the U.S. and the rest of the world witness Trump’s America is up to the faithless.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex to bring &#x2018;dangerously cold&#x2019; weather to New England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  A large part of the U.S. is preparing for the coldest December in years after the polar vortex made a comeback.The polar vortex is located in the middle and upper tropospheres and extends into the stratosphere. It is in fact a band of low pressure Arctic air normally centered around the North Pole.It is held in place by the jet stream, a river of wind that divides cold air from warm air. The jet stream bends around high or low pressure weather systems. When it does, the center of the vortex moves south into North America. The polar vortex can strengthen or weaken. A strong polar vortex keeps the cold air closer to the North Pole, whereas a weak polar vortex spreads the cold air southward.Two arctic blasts will make their ways into the U.S., with the first round of cold air already affecting the Plains and Upper Midwest. The second wave will plunge south of the Canadian border by this weekend. The most intense lobe of the polar vortex will cover New England by Friday, bringing ‘dangerously cold’ weather to the area.]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <title>Hackers can copy fingerprints from photos, steal your identity with peace sign selfies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Attempted murder caught on camera: California man charged for shooting of U.S. diplomat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Space robot: NASA to launch autonomous satellite repair robot Restore-L in summer 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA  In the summer of 2020, NASA will launch the Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft tasked with carrying out maintenance and repair on satellites orbiting earth.NASA awarded a $127 million contract to California-based Space Systems/Loral build Restore-L, reported Vice’s technology news website Motherboard.According to information posted on the Restore-L section of NASA Robotic Servicing Mission website, it will navigate Earth’s orbit using a combination of advanced hardware and algorithms at speeds of over 16,000 miles per hour. This technology will allow it to calculate how to connect with a satellite orbiting the earth at the same speed.Restore-L will use dexterous mechanical arms to service satellites in low earth orbit. This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>JonBenet Ramsey case: New DNA testing planned after report revealed flaws</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOULDER, COLORADO  New DNA testing is planned in the investigation of the unsolved murder of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead in 1996. An exclusive report revealed flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing.According to a joint report by Daily Camera and 9News, the DNA samples from JonBenet’s long johns belong to at least two people, in addition to herself. Also, the DNA profile gathered from JonBenet’s underwear could be a composite and not just from a single individual. The new findings make the link between the DNA found in the underwear and the long johns extremely weak, and could result in the DNA findings being considered evidence.Mary Lacy, the district attorney at the time, was given this analysis of the DNA. However, she concluded that the DNA found in JonBenet’s underwear and the DNA found in her long johns pointed to an unknown male. This conclusion exonerated the Ramsey family from suspicion in 2008.Lacy did not respond to requests for comment after the report revealed the DNA findings failed to support her decision to exonerate the Ramsey family.JonBenet was found murdered in the basement of the family house in Boulder, Colorado. Her mother, Patsy Ramsey said she realized her daughter was missing after finding a ransom letter on the kitchen staircase the morning after Christmas and quickly phoned the police. However, police did not find her body during the initial search of the house. It was her father, John Ramsey, who found JonBenet’s body in the wine cellar room in the basement that afternoon.JonBenet was duct taped over the month and her wrists were tied. A garrote was found around her neck and her skull was fractured due to a heavy blow.]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <title>Hackers can copy fingerprints from photos, steal your identity with peace sign selfies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

In October, 21 girls were released after a government negotiation. In November, the Nigerian army found another girl with a 10-month-old baby in the Sambisa Forest.Some 196 school girls are still reportedly being held captive. Meanwhile, the Nigeria’s defence department declared on Thursday that Boko Haram has been completely wiped out in the country.“Boko Haram is gone in Nigeria and it has gone for good. There is no Jupiter that can bring Boko Haram; what we are doing is to only sensitise citizens on the need to alert us on fleeing Boko Haram members. On the Chibok girls, our Operation Rescue Finale is still ongoing to rescue the girls,” Brigadier-General Rabe Abubakar, the Director of Defence Information in Nigeria, told the Daily Post]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Russia to build futuristic nuclear-powered icebreaker to keep Northern Sea Route open</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>Russian ambassador shot dead by off-duty Turkish cop in Ankara</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[KARAK, JORDAN  At least 10 people, including a Canadian tourist, were killed and 29 others were injured when militants opened fire from a Crusader-era castle in Jordan on Sunday.A series of attacks in the southern city of Karak began when a police patrol went to check on a house fire. One policeman was wounded when gunmen fired from inside the house before the attackers fled in a car, Al Jazeera reported.Soon afterward, gunmen shot at another police patrol, while at the same time an unknown number of assailants opened fire on police and civilians from the city’s 874-year-old castle. Police and security forces surrounded the castle and exchanged fire with the militants for several hours.Four gunmen were killed at the castle, where police found large quantities of explosives, weapons and suicide belts.The dead Canadian woman was named by CBC News as Linda Vatcher, 62, a retired teacher from Newfoundland who was visiting her son in the Middle East.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>Ambulance drone: Texas company argodesign unveils done that can be used as an ambulance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY  Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by an off-duty police officer at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday evening.Ambassador Andrei Karlov was giving a speech at an art gallery when he was gunned down. The gunman was identified as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, a riot police officer in the Turkish capital. The gunman used his police identification to enter the event, Al Arabiya reported.Altintas was seen standing behind Karlov posing as a bodyguard, while the ambassador was giving his speech. Several minutes into the speech, Altintas opened fire at Karlov from behind. He also shot the envoy at least one more time at close range after he collapsed to the floor.Police officers killed the gunman about 15 minutes after the shooting. At least three other people were injured in the assault on the envoy.It is not clear if the gunman was associated with any terrorist groups. However, after shooting the ambassador Altintas shouted in Arabic: “God is great! Those who pledged allegiance to Muhammad for jihad. God is great!”. He then switched to Turkish and shouted: “Don’t forget Aleppo, don’t forget Syria!”]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>Shooting at Mexico BPM festival: 5 dead, 15 injured as gunman attacks Cancun nightclub</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLAYA DEL CARMEN, MEXICO  An attack at 10-day electronic music festival in Mexico killed at least five people when a gunman opened fire outside a popular nightclub just south of Cancun. On January 16 at around 2:30am, shooting erupted at the annual BPM music festival when a man armed with a gun tried to enter the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen. At that moment, gunshots were fired in the immediate vicinity, as the lone gunman reportedly exchanged fire with someone inside the venue. The music festival’s staff intervened to protect club-goers, and they themselves were caught in the crossfire. Three security staff have been reported dead.The unknown assailant then fled, as the remaining revelers exited the club, running for their lives. One woman was trampled in the stampede. Video of the incident captured during the frightening scramble depicts the horror. Among the five confirmed dead by officials are two Canadians, an Italian, and a Colombian, with at least 15 more injured. Authorities have detained three suspects, and have ruled out terror as a motive in the attack.The deadly incident took place on the closing day of the festival.]]></description>

      <title>Ambulance drone: Texas company argodesign unveils done that can be used as an ambulance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Russia to build futuristic nuclear-powered icebreaker to keep Northern Sea Route open</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin attack: Truck plows into crowded Christmas market, killing at least 12 people</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Cancer research: Cells that rise from the dead may spread cancer in the body</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Cells that undergo a near-death experience but refuse to die could be responsible for helping cancer spread in the body.Scientists once thought that cells killed themselves in a process called apoptosis, which is triggered when a molecule called a caspase is activated, Science News reported.However, research conducted within the last decade indicates that cells can abort their own suicide in a process named anastasis, and now scientists say this could have implications for the treatment of cancer.Unpublished research from biologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, indicates that despite receiving chemotherapy treatment, cancer cells can come back to life through the anastasis.Those cancer cells can then multiply and spread throughout the body. That means that stopping anastasis could provide more effective cancer treatments, according to the researchers.However, in some cases, such as saving heart cells after a heart attack or brain cells after a stroke, provoking anastasis may be beneficial.Scientists still don’t know how anastasis works, which means this kind of cancer research is still very much in its infancy.]]></description>

      <title>Life-saving technologies: Stockholm ambulances hijack radio frequency to send warnings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM  Accidents involving ambulances and modern vehicles so well-insulated against noise that drivers can’t hear emergency sirens until it’s too late are on the rise in Sweden.In response, ambulances in Stockholm are testing a new emergency warning system that emits an FM radio signal, according to developers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.The radio signal is picked up by vehicles with a Radio Data System. Drivers’ own stereo systems then alert them to slow down and make space for an approaching ambulance.The system interrupts all audio playback inside vehicles with a voice announcement about the presence of an ambulance nearby. The announcement is accompanied by a text message on the stereo tuner’s display.The system reaches two-thirds of vehicles on Swedish roads, and can also warn of accidents ahead, according to the developers.The developers said the system will enhance accessibility for first responders and improve road safety.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[RANN, NIGERIA  The Nigerian Air Force killed at least 52 civilians and aid workers, and injured 120 more in an airstrike that was supposed to be targeting Boko Haram on Tuesday.The incident took place at a refugee camp located in the city of Rann, in the far north of Borno state of Nigeria at about 9 a.m. Humanitarian groups Doctors Without Borders and International Committee of the Red Cross were operating at the camp when it was bombed.“In recent weeks Boko Haram has moved base to Kala from Sambisa Forest and obviously a military jet mistook Rann for Kala and bombarded, killing many civilians," Rann resident Abba Abiso told AFP. The Nigerian army said the air force had been given coordinates of the Kala Balge area, a district including Rann, and a fighter jet had apparently targeted Rann instead of nearby Kala city.Doctors Without Borders said it had counted 52 dead and 120 wounded. The International Committee of the Red Cross said 6 Nigerian Red Cross members were killed and 13 were wounded.The Nigerian president said in a statement that the airstrike was a “regrettable operational mistake.” The army was unable to provide an official death toll, but one senior commander described the casualties from the attack as “huge,” AFP reported.]]></description>

      <title>Volcano pyroclastic flow: Pyroclastic flows move rapidly and destroy all in their way</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLANET EARTH  The most explosive volcanic eruptions spit out a fast-moving and incredibly destructive mass of material known as a pyroclastic flow.Should you ever find yourself in the path of one, you should run in the opposite direction as quickly as possible, according to the United States Geological Survey.Pyroclastic flows are made up of a basal flow of volcanic ash, lava, rock and gases, which move beneath a cloud of ash. Their temperatures can exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius, and they can move at 700 kilometers per hour.Typically, pyroclastic flows move downslope but they can go uphill when the ratio of gas to ash is higher, according to Forbes. This is known as a pyroclastic surge.These dense pyroclastic surges can even move over water.Pyroclastic flows generally destroy everything in their path including vegetation, buildings and people.There are generally two kinds of pyroclastic flow. The first type forms when an eruption column cools and the ash becomes too dense to maintain an upward thrust.The second type is rarer and occurs when so much pressure builds up inside a volcano that it erupts laterally and boils over.The last known example of this is when Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted in 1980.]]></description>

      <title>Shooting at Mexico BPM festival: 5 dead, 15 injured as gunman attacks Cancun nightclub</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLAYA DEL CARMEN, MEXICO  An attack at 10-day electronic music festival in Mexico killed at least five people when a gunman opened fire outside a popular nightclub just south of Cancun. On January 16 at around 2:30am, shooting erupted at the annual BPM music festival when a man armed with a gun tried to enter the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen. At that moment, gunshots were fired in the immediate vicinity, as the lone gunman reportedly exchanged fire with someone inside the venue. The music festival’s staff intervened to protect club-goers, and they themselves were caught in the crossfire. Three security staff have been reported dead.The unknown assailant then fled, as the remaining revelers exited the club, running for their lives. One woman was trampled in the stampede. Video of the incident captured during the frightening scramble depicts the horror. Among the five confirmed dead by officials are two Canadians, an Italian, and a Colombian, with at least 15 more injured. Authorities have detained three suspects, and have ruled out terror as a motive in the attack.The deadly incident took place on the closing day of the festival.]]></description>

      <title>Ambulance drone: Texas company argodesign unveils done that can be used as an ambulance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Attempted murder caught on camera: California man charged for shooting of U.S. diplomat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[MAIDUGURI, NIGERIA  Nigerian army said on Thursday that they have found a schoolgirl who was kidnapped by Boko Haram insurgents. She was found with a baby in her arms.The girl has been identified as Rakiya Abubakar. She was found wandering in the Sambisa Forest along with a 6-month-old baby.  According to CNN, Abubakar told the soldiers that she was one of the girls kidnapped from Chibok Secondary School in April 2014.Nearly 300 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram insurgents from a boarding school in Chibok in April 2014.In May 2016, one of the girls escaped. In October, 21 girls were released after a government negotiation. In November, the Nigerian army found another girl with a 10-month-old baby in the Sambisa Forest.Some 196 school girls are still reportedly being held captive. Meanwhile, the Nigeria’s defence department declared on Thursday that Boko Haram has been completely wiped out in the country.“Boko Haram is gone in Nigeria and it has gone for good. There is no Jupiter that can bring Boko Haram; what we are doing is to only sensitise citizens on the need to alert us on fleeing Boko Haram members.

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it.

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  A truck plowed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday night, killing at least 12 people and injuring 48 others.The incident took place at a Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the German capital. The truck was loaded with steel beams. It was registered to a company in Poland, from where it traveled to Berlin on Monday afternoon, the Guardian reported. The company that owns the truck said it had been unable to contact the driver since 4 p.m. on Monday.The truck jumped the sidewalk and crashed through several market stalls before coming to a stop. A passenger was found dead inside the vehicle while the driver allegedly fled the scene. Police made an arrest near the market but it is not yet confirmed whether the man was the driver.German police believe the incident was an attack. It highly resembles the July terror attack in Nice, France when an Islamist extremist deliberately drove a 19-ton truck into the city’s promenade and killed 86 people.]]></description>

      <title>End of the world: Astronomers say giant sun will destroy all life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEUVEN, BELGIUM  Astronomers predict that all life on Earth will be wiped out in 5 billion years, as the sun balloons in size and scorches the planet.Scientists at the University of Leuven in Belgium used ALMA, the world’s most powerful radio telescope, to forecast the future of the planet, according to a study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.They predict that within 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant star one hundred times its current size. The sun will swallow up and destroy its two closest planets, Mercury and Venus, and all life on Earth is likely to be destroyed.There is, however, a possibility the rocky core of the planet could survive.In 7 billion years, the sun will then experience intense loss of mass due to strong stellar winds that will see it evolve into a tiny white dwarf star.If the earth’s rocky core survives, it may continue to orbit the white dwarf star.The white dwarf star will be similar in size to Earth but much heavier. One teaspoon of its matter will weigh about 5 tons.The astronomers’ findings are based on an examination of L2 Puppis, an evolved star 208 light years away from Earth, which 5 billion years ago was very similar to our sun.The scientists said an object orbiting L2 Puppis is likely to be a planet, and further study could offer unique insights into Earth’s eventual fate.]]></description>

      <title>Chelsea Manning: WikiLeaks whistleblower to go free in May after Obama commutes sentence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS  Just days before the end of his administration, U.S. President Barack Obama surprisingly granted clemency to one of America’s most controversial whistleblowers.The New York Times reports that in late 2009, Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, was deployed to Iraq by the U.S. Army. As an intelligence analyst, the Army private was allowed access to classified computer networks.Manning copied more than 700,000 documents, videos, war logs and diplomatic cables, in one of the biggest breaches of classified material in American history.The files were sent to WikiLeaks and made public, exposing everything from abuses of detainees to sensitive diplomatic deals and conversations. Among the items leaked was a video showing a U.S. helicopter attack on suspected insurgents in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists.Manning was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act and leaking government information. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison.The 29-year-old had been struggling with gender dysphoria while in the Army. After her sentencing, she came out as transgender and changed her name to Chelsea.She struggled with her mental health in prison and twice attempted suicide while incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth.On Jan. 17, President Obama commuted her sentence from 35 to seven years. She will be released on May 17, 2017.Manning’s road to freedom is in stark contrast to fellow leaker Edward Snowden, who is wanted on similar charges. Snowden also applied for a commuted sentence.White House officials say the two cases are different because Manning acknowledging her wrongdoing and went through the military criminal justice process. Snowden, however, fled to Russia, an adversary that has most recently been implicated in efforts to tamper with the U.S. presidential election.]]></description>

      <title>Life-saving technologies: Stockholm ambulances hijack radio frequency to send warnings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM  Accidents involving ambulances and modern vehicles so well-insulated against noise that drivers can’t hear emergency sirens until it’s too late are on the rise in Sweden.In response, ambulances in Stockholm are testing a new emergency warning system that emits an FM radio signal, according to developers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.The radio signal is picked up by vehicles with a Radio Data System. Drivers’ own stereo systems then alert them to slow down and make space for an approaching ambulance.The system interrupts all audio playback inside vehicles with a voice announcement about the presence of an ambulance nearby. The announcement is accompanied by a text message on the stereo tuner’s display.The system reaches two-thirds of vehicles on Swedish roads, and can also warn of accidents ahead, according to the developers.The developers said the system will enhance accessibility for first responders and improve road safety.]]></description>

      <title>Missile attack gone wrong: Nigeria airstrike mistakenly targets refugee camp, kills 50+</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RANN, NIGERIA  The Nigerian Air Force killed at least 52 civilians and aid workers, and injured 120 more in an airstrike that was supposed to be targeting Boko Haram on Tuesday.The incident took place at a refugee camp located in the city of Rann, in the far north of Borno state of Nigeria at about 9 a.m. Humanitarian groups Doctors Without Borders and International Committee of the Red Cross were operating at the camp when it was bombed.“In recent weeks Boko Haram has moved base to Kala from Sambisa Forest and obviously a military jet mistook Rann for Kala and bombarded, killing many civilians," Rann resident Abba Abiso told AFP. The Nigerian army said the air force had been given coordinates of the Kala Balge area, a district including Rann, and a fighter jet had apparently targeted Rann instead of nearby Kala city.Doctors Without Borders said it had counted 52 dead and 120 wounded. The International Committee of the Red Cross said 6 Nigerian Red Cross members were killed and 13 were wounded.The Nigerian president said in a statement that the airstrike was a “regrettable operational mistake.” The army was unable to provide an official death toll, but one senior commander described the casualties from the attack as “huge,” AFP reported.]]></description>

      <title>Volcano pyroclastic flow: Pyroclastic flows move rapidly and destroy all in their way</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLANET EARTH  The most explosive volcanic eruptions spit out a fast-moving and incredibly destructive mass of material known as a pyroclastic flow.Should you ever find yourself in the path of one, you should run in the opposite direction as quickly as possible, according to the United States Geological Survey.Pyroclastic flows are made up of a basal flow of volcanic ash, lava, rock and gases, which move beneath a cloud of ash. Their temperatures can exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius, and they can move at 700 kilometers per hour.Typically, pyroclastic flows move downslope but they can go uphill when the ratio of gas to ash is higher, according to Forbes. This is known as a pyroclastic surge.These dense pyroclastic surges can even move over water.Pyroclastic flows generally destroy everything in their path including vegetation, buildings and people.There are generally two kinds of pyroclastic flow. The first type forms when an eruption column cools and the ash becomes too dense to maintain an upward thrust.The second type is rarer and occurs when so much pressure builds up inside a volcano that it erupts laterally and boils over.The last known example of this is when Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted in 1980.]]></description>

      <title>Shooting at Mexico BPM festival: 5 dead, 15 injured as gunman attacks Cancun nightclub</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLAYA DEL CARMEN, MEXICO  An attack at 10-day electronic music festival in Mexico killed at least five people when a gunman opened fire outside a popular nightclub just south of Cancun. On January 16 at around 2:30am, shooting erupted at the annual BPM music festival when a man armed with a gun tried to enter the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen. At that moment, gunshots were fired in the immediate vicinity, as the lone gunman reportedly exchanged fire with someone inside the venue. The music festival’s staff intervened to protect club-goers, and they themselves were caught in the crossfire. Three security staff have been reported dead.The unknown assailant then fled, as the remaining revelers exited the club, running for their lives. One woman was trampled in the stampede. Video of the incident captured during the frightening scramble depicts the horror. Among the five confirmed dead by officials are two Canadians, an Italian, and a Colombian, with at least 15 more injured.

      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <title>Hackers can copy fingerprints from photos, steal your identity with peace sign selfies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Attempted murder caught on camera: California man charged for shooting of U.S. diplomat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty.

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <title>Space robot: NASA to launch autonomous satellite repair robot Restore-L in summer 2020</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA  In the summer of 2020, NASA will launch the Restore-L, a robotic spacecraft tasked with carrying out maintenance and repair on satellites orbiting earth.NASA awarded a $127 million contract to California-based Space Systems/Loral build Restore-L, reported Vice’s technology news website Motherboard.According to information posted on the Restore-L section of NASA Robotic Servicing Mission website, it will navigate Earth’s orbit using a combination of advanced hardware and algorithms at speeds of over 16,000 miles per hour. This technology will allow it to calculate how to connect with a satellite orbiting the earth at the same speed.Restore-L will use dexterous mechanical arms to service satellites in low earth orbit. This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>$50 million fund set up to tear down &#x2018;deadbeat dams&#x2019; in order to restore rivers in the West</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A $50 million fund will be devoted to help communities in the U.S. to remove old and unneeded dams in an attempt to restore rivers.The funding was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to establish a 10 year program in order to remove obsolete dams and restore rivers across the West.“The Open Rivers Fund honors this legacy by boosting local efforts to remove aged dams that have broad support in the community. The safety, economic, and environmental benefits of removing these dams will be immediate and long-term,” Hewlett Foundation president Larry Kramer said in a press release.Three projects will be benefited by the funding, including the removal of the Matilija Dam in Ventura, California; a series of dams in Oregon’s Rogue River basin; and the Nelson Dam in Yakima River watershed in Washington.According to the New York Times, of the more than 80,000 dams in the U.S., more than 26,000 pose high safety hazards, the majority does not serve any real purpose while only about 1,750 produce hydropower.These deadbeat dams block the natural migration and spawning of some fish, threatening the ecosystem. They also block the movements of nutrients and sediment in the river, which deprives downstream estuaries of nutrient-rich water. The reduced water flow raises the temperature and results in algae bloom.]]></description>

      <title>Iceland missing woman: Iceland gripped by search for woman in mysterious disappearance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[REYKJAVIK, ICELAND  Iceland has been gripped by the disappearance of a young woman  an extremely rare occurrence in a country with a population of just 320,000.Three members of a Greenlandic fishing trawler crew have been arrested in connection with Birna Brjansdottir’s disappearance, Iceland Monitor reported.Members of the public and more than 130 rescue workers joined the Icelandic police in a huge search after Brjansdottir went missing on Jan. 14.The young woman was last seen by witnesses at around 4 a.m. at a bar in Reykjavik. CCTV cameras filmed her last known movements as she walked away from the downtown area at 5:25 a.m. Nearby, a red Kia car was also spotted by security cameras at the same time.Brjansdottir’s cell phone was manually switched off about 30 minutes later, near Hafnarfjordur Harbor, some 10 kilometers south of the spot where she was last seen. Considering the distance traveled in such a short period of time, police believe the missing woman was driven in a vehicle.Soon after Brjansdottir’s phone was turned off, the red Kia was seen on CCTV at Hafnarfjordur Harbor. Police traced the car as a rental vehicle, which was hired by crew members of a trawler from Greenland docked at the harbor.Brjansdottir’s Dr Marten’s boots were later found near the harbor.After the trawler departed, the Danish coast guard intercepted the boat and turned it back to Iceland. Icelandic police then flew over by helicopter to inspect the vessel.Two members of the trawler crew were arrested aboard the ship. A third crew member was later arrested and all three were being questioned by police.Police do not believe Brjansdottir boarded the ship.Divers searched the harbor for clues but there has still been no sign of Brjansdottir.]]></description>

      <title>Our moon was actually formed by the collision and merger of many tiny moons, researchers say</title>
      <description><![CDATA[REHOVOT, ISRAEL  Researchers in Israel have revived a decades-old theory that the moon was created by a series of collisions in space.Many scientists believe the moon was created when a Mars-sized planet crashed into early Earth billions of years ago. However, the Israeli scientists say simulations show their theory is the correct one, in research published in the journal Nature.They say the moon was created over millions of years by objects in space colliding with Earth. Multiple impacts sent material from Earth flying into space, which then began orbiting the planet.The objects hit Earth at different angles, which sent more material into space than would have occurred from a single impact.The objects that collided with Earth had between a hundredth and a tenth of the planet’s mass. So much material was excavated from Earth by these collisions that a ring of debris formed around the planet.As the debris orbited Earth, it then collided, forming small moons known as moonlets. As many as 20 moonlets then collided together over millions of years to form the moon. The researchers say this explains why the moon has an Earth-like chemical makeup.A widely believed theory says a planet called Theia provided most of the building materials for the moon when it crashed into Earth 4.5 billion years ago, according to Science News. But now the Israeli scientists say more research into the interiors of Earth and the moon is needed to prove their theory right.]]></description>

      <title>Chelsea Manning: WikiLeaks whistleblower to go free in May after Obama commutes sentence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS  Just days before the end of his administration, U.S. President Barack Obama surprisingly granted clemency to one of America’s most controversial whistleblowers.The New York Times reports that in late 2009, Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, was deployed to Iraq by the U.S. Army. As an intelligence analyst, the Army private was allowed access to classified computer networks.Manning copied more than 700,000 documents, videos, war logs and diplomatic cables, in one of the biggest breaches of classified material in American history.The files were sent to WikiLeaks and made public, exposing everything from abuses of detainees to sensitive diplomatic deals and conversations. Among the items leaked was a video showing a U.S. helicopter attack on suspected insurgents in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists.Manning was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act and leaking government information. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison.The 29-year-old had been struggling with gender dysphoria while in the Army. After her sentencing, she came out as transgender and changed her name to Chelsea.She struggled with her mental health in prison and twice attempted suicide while incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth.On Jan. 17, President Obama commuted her sentence from 35 to seven years. She will be released on May 17, 2017.Manning’s road to freedom is in stark contrast to fellow leaker Edward Snowden, who is wanted on similar charges. Snowden also applied for a commuted sentence.White House officials say the two cases are different because Manning acknowledging her wrongdoing and went through the military criminal justice process. Snowden, however, fled to Russia, an adversary that has most recently been implicated in efforts to tamper with the U.S. presidential election.]]></description>

      <title>Life-saving technologies: Stockholm ambulances hijack radio frequency to send warnings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM  Accidents involving ambulances and modern vehicles so well-insulated against noise that drivers can’t hear emergency sirens until it’s too late are on the rise in Sweden.In response, ambulances in Stockholm are testing a new emergency warning system that emits an FM radio signal, according to developers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.The radio signal is picked up by vehicles with a Radio Data System. Drivers’ own stereo systems then alert them to slow down and make space for an approaching ambulance.The system interrupts all audio playback inside vehicles with a voice announcement about the presence of an ambulance nearby. The announcement is accompanied by a text message on the stereo tuner’s display.The system reaches two-thirds of vehicles on Swedish roads, and can also warn of accidents ahead, according to the developers.The developers said the system will enhance accessibility for first responders and improve road safety.]]></description>

      <title>Missile attack gone wrong: Nigeria airstrike mistakenly targets refugee camp, kills 50+</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RANN, NIGERIA  The Nigerian Air Force killed at least 52 civilians and aid workers, and injured 120 more in an airstrike that was supposed to be targeting Boko Haram on Tuesday.The incident took place at a refugee camp located in the city of Rann, in the far north of Borno state of Nigeria at about 9 a.m. Humanitarian groups Doctors Without Borders and International Committee of the Red Cross were operating at the camp when it was bombed.“In recent weeks Boko Haram has moved base to Kala from Sambisa Forest and obviously a military jet mistook Rann for Kala and bombarded, killing many civilians," Rann resident Abba Abiso told AFP. The Nigerian army said the air force had been given coordinates of the Kala Balge area, a district including Rann, and a fighter jet had apparently targeted Rann instead of nearby Kala city.Doctors Without Borders said it had counted 52 dead and 120 wounded. The International Committee of the Red Cross said 6 Nigerian Red Cross members were killed and 13 were wounded.The Nigerian president said in a statement that the airstrike was a “regrettable operational mistake.” The army was unable to provide an official death toll, but one senior commander described the casualties from the attack as “huge,” AFP reported.]]></description>

      <title>Volcano pyroclastic flow: Pyroclastic flows move rapidly and destroy all in their way</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLANET EARTH  The most explosive volcanic eruptions spit out a fast-moving and incredibly destructive mass of material known as a pyroclastic flow.Should you ever find yourself in the path of one, you should run in the opposite direction as quickly as possible, according to the United States Geological Survey.Pyroclastic flows are made up of a basal flow of volcanic ash, lava, rock and gases, which move beneath a cloud of ash. Their temperatures can exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius, and they can move at 700 kilometers per hour.Typically, pyroclastic flows move downslope but they can go uphill when the ratio of gas to ash is higher, according to Forbes. This is known as a pyroclastic surge.These dense pyroclastic surges can even move over water.Pyroclastic flows generally destroy everything in their path including vegetation, buildings and people.There are generally two kinds of pyroclastic flow. The first type forms when an eruption column cools and the ash becomes too dense to maintain an upward thrust.The second type is rarer and occurs when so much pressure builds up inside a volcano that it erupts laterally and boils over.The last known example of this is when Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted in 1980.]]></description>

      <title>Shooting at Mexico BPM festival: 5 dead, 15 injured as gunman attacks Cancun nightclub</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLAYA DEL CARMEN, MEXICO  An attack at 10-day electronic music festival in Mexico killed at least five people when a gunman opened fire outside a popular nightclub just south of Cancun. On January 16 at around 2:30am, shooting erupted at the annual BPM music festival when a man armed with a gun tried to enter the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen. At that moment, gunshots were fired in the immediate vicinity, as the lone gunman reportedly exchanged fire with someone inside the venue. The music festival’s staff intervened to protect club-goers, and they themselves were caught in the crossfire. Three security staff have been reported dead.The unknown assailant then fled, as the remaining revelers exited the club, running for their lives. One woman was trampled in the stampede. Video of the incident captured during the frightening scramble depicts the horror. Among the five confirmed dead by officials are two Canadians, an Italian, and a Colombian, with at least 15 more injured. Authorities have detained three suspects, and have ruled out terror as a motive in the attack.The deadly incident took place on the closing day of the festival.]]></description>

      <title>Ambulance drone: Texas company argodesign unveils done that can be used as an ambulance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <title>Hackers can copy fingerprints from photos, steal your identity with peace sign selfies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

This service will reportedly involve a maintenance check and repairs as well as redeployment of the satellite. The robotic spacecraft could also upgrade satellites and, all-in-all, prolong the lifespan of those already in space.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin truck attack: asylum seeker suspect was investigated in terror probe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  New information has revealed that the suspect connected with this week’s truck attack in Berlin was previously investigated by German police in a terrorism probe.Documents found inside the vehicle used to kill 12 people in Berlin on Monday have been linked to a Tunisian asylum seeker, reported Reuters. That suspect was identified as Anis Amri, reported the Washington Post. He’s said to have left Tunisia seven years ago. According to Reuters, Amri initially came to Italy as an illegal immigrant. His father explained to a Tunisian radio station that he spent four years in jail there on accusations of setting a school on fire. In 2015, he wound up in Germany, where he was investigated for allegedly planning a robbery to finance a terror attack, but this was dropped due to a lack of evidence, reported the Washington PostAuthorities were also aware that Amri had “interacted” with ISIS-linked Abu Walaa who was arrested last month for allegedly sending fighters to Islamic State.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama bans offshore drilling in portions of Arctic and Atlantic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. President Barack Obama has invoked a provision in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to indefinitely block drilling in millions of acres of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, a move that is unlikely to be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office.According to a statement published by the U.S. Department of Interior, President Obama’s withdrawal decision protects 31 canyons in Atlantic waters, extending from the coast of New England to Virginia.The Arctic withdrawal encompasses the entire Chukchi Sea and large portions of the Beaufort Sea, leaving just about 2.8 million acres between Kaktovik and Utqiaġvik for oil production.However, Alaska’s three-member congressional delegation sharply criticised the withdrawal plan.“President Obama has once again treated the Arctic like a snow globe, ignoring the desires of the people who live, work, and raise a family there,” Los Angeles Times quoted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as saying. “I cannot wait to work with the next administration to reverse this decision”.Canada also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic, but this decision will be reviewed every five years.]]></description>

      <title>Rolling guardrail invented in South Korea could save more lives in auto accidents</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA  A South Korean company has designed a rolling guardrail system that is almost unbreakable in accidents and thus could save lives more lives than traditional guardrails during serious auto accidents.South Korean company Evolution in Traffic Innovation (ETI) has named the guardrail as the “Rolling Barrier System”. It consists of rotating barrels made of ethylene-vinyl acetate and metal frames. Ethylene-vinyl acetate has excellent shock absorption power and is more durable than rubber or urethane.The guardrail has a luminescent quality which makes it highly visible to drivers during the night time.When a car hits the guardrail, the barrels rotate to convert shock energy from the vehicle into rotational energy. As a result, the car is propelled forward back onto the road rather than breaking through the barrier. The upper and lower frames of the guardrail can prevent both large and small vehicles’ steering systems from suffering functional loss.]]></description>

      <title>Airport control gaffe sends EVA flight into another plane&#x2019;s flight path</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES    An EVA Airlines jet flying to Taipei, Taiwan from Los Angeles International was mistakenly sent into the path of another plane last Friday morning.An air traffic controller told the EVA pilot to make a 180-degree-left turn when she actually meant right, reported ABC 7. This sent the aircraft into the path of an Air Canada flight and close to terrain on the San Gabriel Mountains.The controller realized the mistake and told the EVA Airlines crew, who managed to get the plane onto the correct path before anything happened.The two planes remained the required distance apart, a Federal Aviation Administration official told CBSLA.  However, aviation investigators are still trying to determine how close EVA Airlines plane was to the San Gabriel Mountains. The required distance between aircraft and such mountainous regions is 2,000 feet.]]></description>

      <title>Berlin terrorist attack: ISIS claims responsibility for Christmas market attack</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN  The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market outside Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial church, killing at least 12 people on Monday evening.The announcement came after German authorities released a man whom they arrested on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported. The initial suspect is a 23-year-old Pakistani national, who was arrested at the Tiergarten park near the Christmas market shortly after the attack. He was released due to lack of evidence.The passenger who was found dead in the cab of the truck has been identified as the original driver of the truck, 37-year-old Polish national Lukasz Urban. He appeared to have been stabbed and shot to death.According to the Telegraph, Lukasz Urban was delivering steel from Turin, Italy to a warehouse in Berlin on Monday morning. However, the warehouse said they couldn’t unload the delivery and told Urban to return on Tuesday. Urban then waited in Berlin with the delivery. He talked to his wife at 3 p.m. before losing contact. It is believed that his truck was hijacked during this time.The company that owns the truck said the truck’s GPS history shows unusual movements from 3:45 p.m. onwards, which indicate Urban was not in control. The truck seemed to have been driven by by someone learning how to drive.German authorities are urging people to remain “particularly vigilant” and to report any suspicious movements, as the real culprit is still at large and possibly armed.]]></description>

      <title>Iceland missing woman: Iceland gripped by search for woman in mysterious disappearance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[REYKJAVIK, ICELAND  Iceland has been gripped by the disappearance of a young woman  an extremely rare occurrence in a country with a population of just 320,000.Three members of a Greenlandic fishing trawler crew have been arrested in connection with Birna Brjansdottir’s disappearance, Iceland Monitor reported.Members of the public and more than 130 rescue workers joined the Icelandic police in a huge search after Brjansdottir went missing on Jan. 14.The young woman was last seen by witnesses at around 4 a.m. at a bar in Reykjavik. CCTV cameras filmed her last known movements as she walked away from the downtown area at 5:25 a.m. Nearby, a red Kia car was also spotted by security cameras at the same time.Brjansdottir’s cell phone was manually switched off about 30 minutes later, near Hafnarfjordur Harbor, some 10 kilometers south of the spot where she was last seen. Considering the distance traveled in such a short period of time, police believe the missing woman was driven in a vehicle.Soon after Brjansdottir’s phone was turned off, the red Kia was seen on CCTV at Hafnarfjordur Harbor. Police traced the car as a rental vehicle, which was hired by crew members of a trawler from Greenland docked at the harbor.Brjansdottir’s Dr Marten’s boots were later found near the harbor.After the trawler departed, the Danish coast guard intercepted the boat and turned it back to Iceland. Icelandic police then flew over by helicopter to inspect the vessel.Two members of the trawler crew were arrested aboard the ship. A third crew member was later arrested and all three were being questioned by police.Police do not believe Brjansdottir boarded the ship.Divers searched the harbor for clues but there has still been no sign of Brjansdottir.]]></description>

      <title>Our moon was actually formed by the collision and merger of many tiny moons, researchers say</title>
      <description><![CDATA[REHOVOT, ISRAEL  Researchers in Israel have revived a decades-old theory that the moon was created by a series of collisions in space.Many scientists believe the moon was created when a Mars-sized planet crashed into early Earth billions of years ago. However, the Israeli scientists say simulations show their theory is the correct one, in research published in the journal Nature.They say the moon was created over millions of years by objects in space colliding with Earth. Multiple impacts sent material from Earth flying into space, which then began orbiting the planet.The objects hit Earth at different angles, which sent more material into space than would have occurred from a single impact.The objects that collided with Earth had between a hundredth and a tenth of the planet’s mass. So much material was excavated from Earth by these collisions that a ring of debris formed around the planet.As the debris orbited Earth, it then collided, forming small moons known as moonlets. As many as 20 moonlets then collided together over millions of years to form the moon. The researchers say this explains why the moon has an Earth-like chemical makeup.A widely believed theory says a planet called Theia provided most of the building materials for the moon when it crashed into Earth 4.5 billion years ago, according to Science News. But now the Israeli scientists say more research into the interiors of Earth and the moon is needed to prove their theory right.]]></description>

      <title>Chelsea Manning: WikiLeaks whistleblower to go free in May after Obama commutes sentence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS  Just days before the end of his administration, U.S. President Barack Obama surprisingly granted clemency to one of America’s most controversial whistleblowers.The New York Times reports that in late 2009, Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, was deployed to Iraq by the U.S. Army. As an intelligence analyst, the Army private was allowed access to classified computer networks.Manning copied more than 700,000 documents, videos, war logs and diplomatic cables, in one of the biggest breaches of classified material in American history.The files were sent to WikiLeaks and made public, exposing everything from abuses of detainees to sensitive diplomatic deals and conversations. Among the items leaked was a video showing a U.S. helicopter attack on suspected insurgents in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists.Manning was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act and leaking government information. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison.The 29-year-old had been struggling with gender dysphoria while in the Army. After her sentencing, she came out as transgender and changed her name to Chelsea.She struggled with her mental health in prison and twice attempted suicide while incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth.On Jan. 17, President Obama commuted her sentence from 35 to seven years. She will be released on May 17, 2017.Manning’s road to freedom is in stark contrast to fellow leaker Edward Snowden, who is wanted on similar charges. Snowden also applied for a commuted sentence.White House officials say the two cases are different because Manning acknowledging her wrongdoing and went through the military criminal justice process. Snowden, however, fled to Russia, an adversary that has most recently been implicated in efforts to tamper with the U.S. presidential election.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM  Accidents involving ambulances and modern vehicles so well-insulated against noise that drivers can’t hear emergency sirens until it’s too late are on the rise in Sweden.In response, ambulances in Stockholm are testing a new emergency warning system that emits an FM radio signal, according to developers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.The radio signal is picked up by vehicles with a Radio Data System. Drivers’ own stereo systems then alert them to slow down and make space for an approaching ambulance.The system interrupts all audio playback inside vehicles with a voice announcement about the presence of an ambulance nearby. The announcement is accompanied by a text message on the stereo tuner’s display.The system reaches two-thirds of vehicles on Swedish roads, and can also warn of accidents ahead, according to the developers.The developers said the system will enhance accessibility for first responders and improve road safety.]]></description>

      <title>Missile attack gone wrong: Nigeria airstrike mistakenly targets refugee camp, kills 50+</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RANN, NIGERIA  The Nigerian Air Force killed at least 52 civilians and aid workers, and injured 120 more in an airstrike that was supposed to be targeting Boko Haram on Tuesday.The incident took place at a refugee camp located in the city of Rann, in the far north of Borno state of Nigeria at about 9 a.m. Humanitarian groups Doctors Without Borders and International Committee of the Red Cross were operating at the camp when it was bombed.“In recent weeks Boko Haram has moved base to Kala from Sambisa Forest and obviously a military jet mistook Rann for Kala and bombarded, killing many civilians," Rann resident Abba Abiso told AFP. The Nigerian army said the air force had been given coordinates of the Kala Balge area, a district including Rann, and a fighter jet had apparently targeted Rann instead of nearby Kala city.Doctors Without Borders said it had counted 52 dead and 120 wounded. The International Committee of the Red Cross said 6 Nigerian Red Cross members were killed and 13 were wounded.The Nigerian president said in a statement that the airstrike was a “regrettable operational mistake.” The army was unable to provide an official death toll, but one senior commander described the casualties from the attack as “huge,” AFP reported.]]></description>

      <title>Volcano pyroclastic flow: Pyroclastic flows move rapidly and destroy all in their way</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLANET EARTH  The most explosive volcanic eruptions spit out a fast-moving and incredibly destructive mass of material known as a pyroclastic flow.Should you ever find yourself in the path of one, you should run in the opposite direction as quickly as possible, according to the United States Geological Survey.Pyroclastic flows are made up of a basal flow of volcanic ash, lava, rock and gases, which move beneath a cloud of ash. Their temperatures can exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius, and they can move at 700 kilometers per hour.Typically, pyroclastic flows move downslope but they can go uphill when the ratio of gas to ash is higher, according to Forbes. This is known as a pyroclastic surge.These dense pyroclastic surges can even move over water.Pyroclastic flows generally destroy everything in their path including vegetation, buildings and people.There are generally two kinds of pyroclastic flow. The first type forms when an eruption column cools and the ash becomes too dense to maintain an upward thrust.The second type is rarer and occurs when so much pressure builds up inside a volcano that it erupts laterally and boils over.The last known example of this is when Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted in 1980.]]></description>

      <title>Shooting at Mexico BPM festival: 5 dead, 15 injured as gunman attacks Cancun nightclub</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLAYA DEL CARMEN, MEXICO  An attack at 10-day electronic music festival in Mexico killed at least five people when a gunman opened fire outside a popular nightclub just south of Cancun. On January 16 at around 2:30am, shooting erupted at the annual BPM music festival when a man armed with a gun tried to enter the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen. At that moment, gunshots were fired in the immediate vicinity, as the lone gunman reportedly exchanged fire with someone inside the venue. The music festival’s staff intervened to protect club-goers, and they themselves were caught in the crossfire. Three security staff have been reported dead.The unknown assailant then fled, as the remaining revelers exited the club, running for their lives. One woman was trampled in the stampede. Video of the incident captured during the frightening scramble depicts the horror. Among the five confirmed dead by officials are two Canadians, an Italian, and a Colombian, with at least 15 more injured. Authorities have detained three suspects, and have ruled out terror as a motive in the attack.The deadly incident took place on the closing day of the festival.]]></description>

      <title>Ambulance drone: Texas company argodesign unveils done that can be used as an ambulance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday.

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>How drunk are you: New wearable tracks your blood alcohol &amp; warns you if you&#x2019;re too drunk</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <title>Russia to build futuristic nuclear-powered icebreaker to keep Northern Sea Route open</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <title>Hidden third temple found inside Mexico&#x2019;s Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza ruins</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities. This pollution is linked to millions of asthma cases, respiratory diseases and thousands of deaths each year, according to the Times of India.The level of harmful fine particulate matter in Delhi’s air last winter reached 15 times the Indian government’s safe level, and more than 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.The researchers said one jet engine can handle emissions from a 1,000 megawatt capacity power plant. The scientists also said the fuel emissions from the jet engines will be negligible compared to the amount of pollution they can clear, and are working to reduce noise pollution during the experiment.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[REYKJAVIK, ICELAND  Iceland has been gripped by the disappearance of a young woman  an extremely rare occurrence in a country with a population of just 320,000.Three members of a Greenlandic fishing trawler crew have been arrested in connection with Birna Brjansdottir’s disappearance, Iceland Monitor reported.Members of the public and more than 130 rescue workers joined the Icelandic police in a huge search after Brjansdottir went missing on Jan. 14.The young woman was last seen by witnesses at around 4 a.m. at a bar in Reykjavik. CCTV cameras filmed her last known movements as she walked away from the downtown area at 5:25 a.m. Nearby, a red Kia car was also spotted by security cameras at the same time.Brjansdottir’s cell phone was manually switched off about 30 minutes later, near Hafnarfjordur Harbor, some 10 kilometers south of the spot where she was last seen. Considering the distance traveled in such a short period of time, police believe the missing woman was driven in a vehicle.Soon after Brjansdottir’s phone was turned off, the red Kia was seen on CCTV at Hafnarfjordur Harbor. Police traced the car as a rental vehicle, which was hired by crew members of a trawler from Greenland docked at the harbor.Brjansdottir’s Dr Marten’s boots were later found near the harbor.After the trawler departed, the Danish coast guard intercepted the boat and turned it back to Iceland. Icelandic police then flew over by helicopter to inspect the vessel.Two members of the trawler crew were arrested aboard the ship. A third crew member was later arrested and all three were being questioned by police.Police do not believe Brjansdottir boarded the ship.Divers searched the harbor for clues but there has still been no sign of Brjansdottir.]]></description>

      <title>Our moon was actually formed by the collision and merger of many tiny moons, researchers say</title>
      <description><![CDATA[REHOVOT, ISRAEL  Researchers in Israel have revived a decades-old theory that the moon was created by a series of collisions in space.Many scientists believe the moon was created when a Mars-sized planet crashed into early Earth billions of years ago. However, the Israeli scientists say simulations show their theory is the correct one, in research published in the journal Nature.They say the moon was created over millions of years by objects in space colliding with Earth. Multiple impacts sent material from Earth flying into space, which then began orbiting the planet.The objects hit Earth at different angles, which sent more material into space than would have occurred from a single impact.The objects that collided with Earth had between a hundredth and a tenth of the planet’s mass. So much material was excavated from Earth by these collisions that a ring of debris formed around the planet.As the debris orbited Earth, it then collided, forming small moons known as moonlets. As many as 20 moonlets then collided together over millions of years to form the moon. The researchers say this explains why the moon has an Earth-like chemical makeup.A widely believed theory says a planet called Theia provided most of the building materials for the moon when it crashed into Earth 4.5 billion years ago, according to Science News. But now the Israeli scientists say more research into the interiors of Earth and the moon is needed to prove their theory right.]]></description>

      <title>Chelsea Manning: WikiLeaks whistleblower to go free in May after Obama commutes sentence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS  Just days before the end of his administration, U.S. President Barack Obama surprisingly granted clemency to one of America’s most controversial whistleblowers.The New York Times reports that in late 2009, Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, was deployed to Iraq by the U.S. Army. As an intelligence analyst, the Army private was allowed access to classified computer networks.Manning copied more than 700,000 documents, videos, war logs and diplomatic cables, in one of the biggest breaches of classified material in American history.The files were sent to WikiLeaks and made public, exposing everything from abuses of detainees to sensitive diplomatic deals and conversations. Among the items leaked was a video showing a U.S. helicopter attack on suspected insurgents in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists.Manning was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act and leaking government information. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison.The 29-year-old had been struggling with gender dysphoria while in the Army. After her sentencing, she came out as transgender and changed her name to Chelsea.She struggled with her mental health in prison and twice attempted suicide while incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth.On Jan. 17, President Obama commuted her sentence from 35 to seven years. She will be released on May 17, 2017.Manning’s road to freedom is in stark contrast to fellow leaker Edward Snowden, who is wanted on similar charges. Snowden also applied for a commuted sentence.White House officials say the two cases are different because Manning acknowledging her wrongdoing and went through the military criminal justice process. Snowden, however, fled to Russia, an adversary that has most recently been implicated in efforts to tamper with the U.S. presidential election.]]></description>

      <title>Life-saving technologies: Stockholm ambulances hijack radio frequency to send warnings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM  Accidents involving ambulances and modern vehicles so well-insulated against noise that drivers can’t hear emergency sirens until it’s too late are on the rise in Sweden.In response, ambulances in Stockholm are testing a new emergency warning system that emits an FM radio signal, according to developers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.The radio signal is picked up by vehicles with a Radio Data System. Drivers’ own stereo systems then alert them to slow down and make space for an approaching ambulance.The system interrupts all audio playback inside vehicles with a voice announcement about the presence of an ambulance nearby. The announcement is accompanied by a text message on the stereo tuner’s display.The system reaches two-thirds of vehicles on Swedish roads, and can also warn of accidents ahead, according to the developers.The developers said the system will enhance accessibility for first responders and improve road safety.]]></description>

      <title>Missile attack gone wrong: Nigeria airstrike mistakenly targets refugee camp, kills 50+</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RANN, NIGERIA  The Nigerian Air Force killed at least 52 civilians and aid workers, and injured 120 more in an airstrike that was supposed to be targeting Boko Haram on Tuesday.The incident took place at a refugee camp located in the city of Rann, in the far north of Borno state of Nigeria at about 9 a.m. Humanitarian groups Doctors Without Borders and International Committee of the Red Cross were operating at the camp when it was bombed.“In recent weeks Boko Haram has moved base to Kala from Sambisa Forest and obviously a military jet mistook Rann for Kala and bombarded, killing many civilians," Rann resident Abba Abiso told AFP. The Nigerian army said the air force had been given coordinates of the Kala Balge area, a district including Rann, and a fighter jet had apparently targeted Rann instead of nearby Kala city.Doctors Without Borders said it had counted 52 dead and 120 wounded. The International Committee of the Red Cross said 6 Nigerian Red Cross members were killed and 13 were wounded.The Nigerian president said in a statement that the airstrike was a “regrettable operational mistake.” The army was unable to provide an official death toll, but one senior commander described the casualties from the attack as “huge,” AFP reported.]]></description>

      <title>Volcano pyroclastic flow: Pyroclastic flows move rapidly and destroy all in their way</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLANET EARTH  The most explosive volcanic eruptions spit out a fast-moving and incredibly destructive mass of material known as a pyroclastic flow.Should you ever find yourself in the path of one, you should run in the opposite direction as quickly as possible, according to the United States Geological Survey.Pyroclastic flows are made up of a basal flow of volcanic ash, lava, rock and gases, which move beneath a cloud of ash. Their temperatures can exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius, and they can move at 700 kilometers per hour.Typically, pyroclastic flows move downslope but they can go uphill when the ratio of gas to ash is higher, according to Forbes. This is known as a pyroclastic surge.These dense pyroclastic surges can even move over water.Pyroclastic flows generally destroy everything in their path including vegetation, buildings and people.There are generally two kinds of pyroclastic flow. The first type forms when an eruption column cools and the ash becomes too dense to maintain an upward thrust.The second type is rarer and occurs when so much pressure builds up inside a volcano that it erupts laterally and boils over.The last known example of this is when Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted in 1980.]]></description>

      <title>Shooting at Mexico BPM festival: 5 dead, 15 injured as gunman attacks Cancun nightclub</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLAYA DEL CARMEN, MEXICO  An attack at 10-day electronic music festival in Mexico killed at least five people when a gunman opened fire outside a popular nightclub just south of Cancun. On January 16 at around 2:30am, shooting erupted at the annual BPM music festival when a man armed with a gun tried to enter the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen. At that moment, gunshots were fired in the immediate vicinity, as the lone gunman reportedly exchanged fire with someone inside the venue. The music festival’s staff intervened to protect club-goers, and they themselves were caught in the crossfire. Three security staff have been reported dead.The unknown assailant then fled, as the remaining revelers exited the club, running for their lives. One woman was trampled in the stampede. Video of the incident captured during the frightening scramble depicts the horror. Among the five confirmed dead by officials are two Canadians, an Italian, and a Colombian, with at least 15 more injured. Authorities have detained three suspects, and have ruled out terror as a motive in the attack.The deadly incident took place on the closing day of the festival.]]></description>

      <title>Ambulance drone: Texas company argodesign unveils done that can be used as an ambulance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <title>Effects of smoking weed: Marijuana relieves chronic pain but can trigger schizophrenia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Wearable tech: Superflex designs Aura Powered suit to help elderly people get around</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <title>Hackers can copy fingerprints from photos, steal your identity with peace sign selfies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>China-Taiwan relations: China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait, Taiwan deploys jets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>New natural tooth repair method may one day replace fillings at the dentist</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Attempted murder caught on camera: California man charged for shooting of U.S. diplomat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUADALAJARA, MEXICO  A California man was charged on Tuesday with the attempted murder of a U.S. diplomat in Guadalajara, Mexico during a shooting last week.The suspect has been identified as Zia Zafar, 31, of Chino Hills, California. Zafar was recorded on security camera shooting Christopher Ashcraft, U.S. vice consul in Guadalajara, Mexico last Friday.According to the Washington Post, Ashcraft told FBI agents that on the day of the attack, he was leaving a gym near a shopping mall when he sensed that a person was waiting for him. He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar. However, when Ashcraft later pulled up in his vehicle at the exit ramp, Zafar was waiting for him and opened fire through the car’s windshield. Ashcraft was shot in the chest.He reportedly is currently in hospital in stable condition.According to reports, Zafar grew up in Chino Hills, California and entered Mexico on a student visa. He was deported from Mexico to the U.S. and arrested on Monday. He made an appearance in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on Tuesday, but court papers did not state what his motive was for the shooting.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>Ear wax removal: Don&#x2019;t clean your ears by yourself, could lead to clogged ears</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.<KEYWORDS>]]></description>

      <title>Amazon airship: Amazon patents unmanned airship to launch its delivery drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  Amazon has filed a patent for a self-driving airship that can store inventory and be used as a base to launch delivery drones.Amazon’s airborne fulfillment centers would hover at an altitude of 45,000 feet and be the focal point of a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.The patent for the airship was filed in 2014 but only came to light last week, when it was uncovered by Zoe Leavitt, an analyst at technology research company CB Insights, Reuters reported.The self-driving airships would carry a cargo of Amazon products and unmanned drones to deliver goods to customers.The drones could navigate horizontally to their destination and would use little to no power, according to the patent.The airships would be replenished by smaller, unmanned service vehicles, which could carry workers, drones, fuel, and inventory.One potential use of the airships could be at big events, such as concerts or football games, where they could be used to deliver souvenirs, or food.Amazon has successfully tested deliveries by drone in the UK and is waiting for federal approval to roll out the service in the United States, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Titanic fire: New evidence suggests huge coal fire sank Titanic in 1912</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  An enormous and uncontrollable fire could be the main reason the Titanic sank on on its disastrous maiden voyage more than a century ago.According to Irish journalist Senan Molony, 30-foot-long black marks seen on the hull of the Titanic before it left Belfast shipyard in 1912 are proof that a huge fire sunk the ship, the Independent reported.The marks can be seen in old photos discovered by Molony, and point to a blaze in a coal room that would have reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius and warped the ship’s steel bulkhead.Molony says the marks appear on the exact area where the Titanic hit an iceberg on its way from Britain to New York, before sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.Some 1,500 people died, making the sinking of the Titanic one of the worst disasters in maritime history.Molony’s theory was presented in a TV documentary shown in the UK earlier this week titled “Titanic: The New Evidence.”He said the ship’s owners were aware of the fire and even took the unusual step of reversing into the dock to hide the damage from passengers.Molony said even though the fire was known, the significance was downplayed and the Titanic “should never have been put to sea.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA  Russia has unveiled a new nuclear-powered icebreaker that is designed to keep the Northern Sea Route open all year round.Russia’s new nuclear-powered icebreaker, known as Leader, will exceed 200 meters in length and will be about 50 meters wide. It would be capable of plowing through 2-meter-thick ice at a speed of 29 kph and capable of cutting through ice up to 4.5 meters thick.It is expected that the new icebreaker would lead tankers carrying liquefied natural gas weighing up to 300,000 tonnes to pass through the Northern Sea Route in any season.Russia launched the world’s biggest icebreaker, the Arktika, in June. The icebreaker is powered by two nuclear reactors and can break through 4-meter-deep ice.]]></description>

      <title>Satellites find molten iron liquid jet-stream at Earth&#x2019;s core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[European Space Agency satellites have detected a large jet stream of liquid iron flowing beneath earth’s surface at a quickening pace.The findings were published in the research journal, Nature GeoScience.The stream is around 10,000 feet deep and moving beneath Canada and Russia at pace of 30 miles per year, reported the New Scientist. It is 260 miles wide and is nearly 20,000 miles long.“We can explain it as an accelerating band of molten iron circling the North Pole, like the jet stream in the atmosphere”, lead researcher Dr Phil Livermore said in an article on the University of Leeds website. This molten jet stream could be caused by buoyant forces in the earth’s core, or variations in the magnetic field within the core, explained University of Leeds Professor Rainer Hollerbach explained in a ESA article detailing the findings.]]></description>

      <title>UK blind patients to be fitted with bionic eye that can restore partial eyesight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  The NHS England will fund the procedures for 10 blind patients to be fitted with bionic eyes, which can restore partial eyesight.The bionic eye is also known as Argus II, which is developed by American company Second Sight Medical Products. The procedure requires the patients to have implants placed in their retinas.They must also wear camera-mounted glasses equipped with transmitters, along with a small computer attached to their waist.The camera records the scene before them while video is sent to the small computer. The image is then transmitted wirelessly to the implant in the eye. The image is converted into electrical pulses and sent to the electrodes attached to the retina. The electrodes then stimulate the remaining cells in the retina to transmit the image to the brain.According to NHS England, the procedures will take place in 2017 and the patients will then be monitored for one year in order to assess how the implants have affected their lives.]]></description>

      <title>Apple Campus 2: Take a look inside Apple&#x2019;s new $5 billion UFO-like headquarters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple’s new Campus 2 headquarters is expected to open in early 2017, according to Mashable.The main building is a ring-shaped, four-storied structure that looks like a huge spaceship. The site covers 176 acres, or about the size of 100 soccer fields.At over 1,500 feet, the main building is greater in diameter than the Empire State Building is tall, and wider than the Pentagon. More than 3,000 sheets of curved glass cover the main building, which is a perfect circle.The site will be be powered completely by renewable energy, including solar power and biofuels. Around 80 percent of the site is green space, complete with jogging and cycling trails.Some 13,000 Apple employees will work at the new headquarters, which has seven different cafes. A thousand bicycles will be available for staff to get around the campus, which will be planted with 7,000 trees.The campus will have a 1,000-seat auditorium, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center, and 300,000 square feet of research and development facilities.Parking garages above and below ground have space for about 14,000 vehicles, while a visitor center offers views over the entire campus. The total cost to build the Apple Campus 2 is estimated to be $5 billion. That figure is equal to around 2 percent of the company’s $215 billion in total cash reserves as of January 2016, according to Macworld.The Apple Campus 2 will be the world’s fifth most expensive building and quite possibly the world’s coolest office.]]></description>

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line will open on Jan. 1</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After almost a century of delays, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is set to open for service on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The new line is an extension of the Q line, which currently stops at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue and will run along Manhattan’s East Side, the New York Times reported. Beginning in January, Q trains will travel to a station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and then to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets.They have been under construction since 2007, although planning for the project as a whole dates all the way back to 1929, according to the Wall Street Journal. The first phase of the project cost around $4.4 billion, reported the New York Times. The MTA is expecting the new route to carry 200,000 riders each day, which should ease overcrowding on the No. 4, 5 and 6 lines along the Lexington Avenue route, which carry 1.3 million commuters daily, AM New York reported. The second phase of the project is in the initial planning stages, and would extend the line to 125th Street in Harlem, according to the New York Times. However, the second phase will cost billions of dollars and take several years to complete, while plans to extend the line to Lower Manhattan are less certain.]]></description>

      <title>Airports of 2040: This is what airports of the future might look like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A U.K. company has released a concept of what airports might be like by the year 2040, and they may be a lot more efficient and passenger-friendly than the ones now.According to the company, passengers will be expected to check-in via self-service desks, which include biometric scanners that can scan passengers’ facial features, iris patterns and fingerprints in order to verify their identities. After check in, a biometric token will be issued and stored in the passenger's smartphone that serves as a boarding pass and ID. Luggage can be dropped at drop-off points.Laser molecular body scanners can detect even tiny-quantities of dangerous materials in passengers’ clothing or their luggage without the need for a body search.Passengers may buy duty-free goods from virtual shopping stations and have the goods delivered to their homes. However, passengers can still get help from virtual assistants when the airport enters self-service phase.Airport control is likely to be operated remotely outside the airport, with staff monitoring live video footage of the airport, similar to the system introduced Sweden. Other technologies, such as biometric scanners, are currently being trialled at Heathrow and Schiphol airports.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO  A hidden third temple was discovered this month inside the Kukulkan Pyramid, one of the world’s most famous ancient structures. Researchers used a 3D scanning technique called electrical resistivity tomography to find the 10-meter-tall structure inside the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza in the Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.  Experts believe this third structure was constructed between the years 550 and 800, reported the BBC, citing researchers.Also known as El Castillo, the Kukulkan was already known to have been made of up other two temples. According to an AFP report, these consist of a 30-meter-tall external structure with another 20-meter-tall pyramid inside of it. It is thought that the new structures were added to cover decaying ones or to welcome new leaders.]]></description>

      <title>Awesome technology inventions: Ortega Mk. 1C submersible can take you 95m underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TWENTE, NETHERLANDS   Dutch engineering company Ortega Submersibles has developed an underwater vehicle that can ferry divers to depths of 95 meters  more than twice a deep as most recreational divers can swim.The vessel is named the named the Mk. 1C. According to information posted on the Ortega Submersibles website and a press kit from the company, the submersible can  carry three people and 350 liters of cargo, meaning divers can carry more air or equipment as required.The 570 kg vessel is powered by two 10 kilowatt hour electric thrusters. These propel it at speeds of up to 16.7 kilometers per hour on the ocean surface, and 20 kilometers per hour underwater. The submersible has lightweight batteries that allow it to operate for 11 hours.The Mk. 1C also features on-board navigational equipment for below and above water as well as on-board air supply for each passenger. Ortega says its designs are based on the World War II Royal Air Force motorized submersible canoe project Sleeping Beauty. These were used by British forces for clandestine reconnaissance missions.Recreational scuba divers can usually swim to depths of between 30 and 40 meters depending on their training agency.]]></description>

      <title>UFO yachts: Futuristic floating houseboats to hit the seas by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY  Italian mini yacht manufacturer Jet Capsule has come out with an updated design for their sleek, floating villa that’s set to be the home of the future.Designed by 34-year-old Pierpaolo Lazzarini, the aptly named UFO 2.0 or Unidentified Floating Object is a houseboat that’s shaped like an alien flying saucer.According to the company’s website, the UFO yacht is equipped with twin 80-horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of up to 10 miles per hour. Built-in solar panels, wind and water turbines are meant to generate enough electricity to fully sustain the vessel, with excess energy being stored in a 16 battery array. The 314-square-meter houseboat will be made from carbon fiber and fiberglass and have three levels. The upper deck will house the controls as well as a hot tub and desk. The first level will consist of a kitchen and bathroom, while a submerged level will hold the bedroom and another bathroom.Its enormous size means the only way to transport the UFO yacht is via military helicopters.Caters News reports that the floating home can be used amid different conditions around the world, and is unsinkable even in rough seas. The external deck is customizable, and the vessel itself can be used for different purposes: a floating restaurant, gym, even a resort.The UFO yacht is expected to be available by 2018. For now, a Kickstarter campaign is underway to raise one million euros to fund the project.]]></description>

      <title>Delhi tries to blast pollution out of the air with old jet engines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW DELHI  A group of scientists led by an MIT professor hopes that an innovative idea can help clear the thick smog that plagues India’s capital city.Researcher Moshe Alamaro and his team will use old jet engines in an attempt to blast air pollution out of New Delhi’s atmosphere, the Times of India reported.The jet engines will be taken to a coal-fired power station and turned on, facing skyward. The engines generate a nozzle speed that’s more or less equal to the speed of sound, which the researchers believe will push smog out of the atmosphere, BBC News reported.During the winter, Delhi experiences a temperature inversion, which traps pollution near the ground. But the scientists said the jet engines have enough power to blast emissions through this lid of warm air. Around 60 percent of India’s energy is provided by coal-fired power plants, which contributes to terrible air pollution in the country’s cities.
