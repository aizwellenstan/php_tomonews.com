This is the first time this type of exoplanet has been found in a star's Neptunian Desert region, CNN reports. Neptunian Desert refers to the area close to stars where no planets similar to Neptune's scale can be found. Stars send out strong radiation to this area. This causes planets to lose their gaseous atmosphere. They usually evaporate, leaving behind a rocky core.According to the new research, NGTS-4b was spotted using a ground telescope called Next Generation Transit Survey.The exoplanet, nicknamed, "The Forbidden Planet," is three times the size of Earth and has a radius that is only 20 percent smaller than Neptune. The exoplanet has temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Celsius.Space.com reports the new exoplanet orbits a star named NGTS-4, which is around 920 light years away from Earth. The exoplanet completes orbits of the star every 1.3 days, according to a University of Warwick press release.Astronomers believe the exoplanet could have moved into the Neptunian Desert region at some point in the past one million years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The mostly peaceful protest turned violent after midnight, after police with batons and pepper spray clashed with demonstrators attempting to occupy areas around the Legislative Council complex.Despite the opposition, the government has no plans to change the bill's wording or withdraw it from legislation.Lam has reasoned that it is necessary to prevent Hong Kong from turning into a fugitive haven, and claims there are human rights safeguards in the bill that meet international standards, and are in place to protect the city's unique freedoms.According to the Guardian, China's Foreign Affairs Ministry said it supports Hong Kong in passing the bill.

The machine is then heated up. This causes the carbon molecules present in the plastic to break down into smaller molecules, essentially turning plastic into usable fuel.Renewlogy explained on their website that gases created from the process would be captured and recycled to prevent any toxic gas emissions.According to the company, the byproduct of the carbon molecules are then converted into naphtha, which is commonly used to create virgin plastic, diesel fuel, and other petrochemical products.

In a new paper published in the journal Nature, scientists studied the population history of Siberia by analyzing DNA from the remains of 34 ancient individuals from sites in northeastern Siberia, northern East Asia, and southwestern Finland that date back 31,600 to 600 years. They then compared them with DNA of ancient and modern humans from Eurasia and North America. Results show the first human groups to arrive in the region were the Ancient North Siberians which are now extinct. Later on, two more migratory waves came from East Asia, the third of which was a group named Neo-Siberians. Modern Siberians can trace their ancestry back to this group.  Scientists also discovered a new group of humans they named Ancient North Siberians by extracting DNA from teeth that belonged to two unrelated children whose remains were found near Siberia's Yana River at a location called the Yana Rhinoceros Horn Site. They believed these would have ties with early native North Americans, however, they appear to be unrelated.DNA collections indicate native North Americans came as a result of mixing between East Asians and a population distantly linked to Ancient Northern Siberians which occurred roughly 20,000 years ago.

However, the new observations using HAWC+ reveals that the magnetic field at the center of the Milky Way channels the gas so it flows into an orbit around the black hole, making the black hole calmer because it's not ingesting any gas that would ultimately create new stars.Principal investigator and lead author of the study Darren Dowell said, "the spiral shape of the magnetic field channels the gas into an orbit around the black holethis could explain why our black hole is quiet while others are active."According to NASA, the new observations using HAWC+ helps understand how the material in the atmosphere of a supermassive black hole interacts with its host, and also to help to answer the long-established question of why the black hole in the center of our Milky Way is fainter in comparison to those in other galaxies.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, describes ghost nets as a silent menace threatening the world's marine species. Here's what makes them so bad. According to the Olive Ridley Project, ghost nets are commercial fishing nets that have been abandoned, lost or discarded at sea.They are made from a strong plastic and can remain in the water for a long time.Ghost nets float with ocean currents and trap plastic and other debris, as well as fish and crustaceans  a process known as ghost fishing.Fish caught in the nets often act as bait, luring larger predators like turtles, sharks and dolphins, who eventually become entangled themselves.When a drifting net becomes too heavy due to its catch, it may eventually sink to the seabed, where smaller ocean dwellers feed on the entangled creatures.This, along with natural decomposition, reduces the weight of the net so that it floats back up to the surface, where it then restarts its destructive cycle.In addition to this, ghost nets can also cause damage by smothering reefs and introducing invasive species and parasites into coral reef habitats.The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that over 600 to 800,000 metric tonnes of ghost gear enters the ocean annually. Some are lost during storms, and some dumped deliberately.Nick Mallos, director of the Trash Free Seas Program at Ocean Conservancy, says ghost nets are the most deadly form of marine litter.Efforts being made to lessen their impact include clearing drifting nets and promoting the use of biodegradable fishing gear. But there is no quick-fix solution, and certain practices, such as illegal fishing, remain a block to progress.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of ghost nets 2. Depiction of ghost fishing3.

But a pilot told The Observer that should the switch malfunction during an engine fire, there's no manual override to deploy the extinguishers, and therefore no way of putting the fire out.The Federal Aviation Administration admitted the malfunction is a risk to the flying public, but decided not to ground the fleet. Instead, it issued an airworthiness directive and required airlines to inspect the switches every 30 days.According to the Observer, the pilot community says Boeing's attitude to the risk is upsetting, especially in light of recent issues with the 737 Max. The FAA has declined to comment on the pilots' concerns, saying only that it invited feedback from the airline industry back when its directive was proposed in February.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The digital currency, called Libra, is backed by a reserve of financial assets, making it less volatile than other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.The social giant won't have direct control over Libra. Instead, it will be serviced by the Libra Association, an independent nonprofit headquartered in Switzerland. Its founding members include companies like Uber, Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal, among others.""The association's main functions are to validate transactions on the Libra blockchain, and manage the reserve the digital currency is tied to.A digital wallet for the new cryptocurrency, called Calibra, is also being launched, and will be available on Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app.Calibra will allow users to send Libra to anyone with a smartphone, and in the future may be used to pay for purchases on the app or to various vendors for day-to-day transactions.According to Facebook, the Libra blockchain is pseudonymous, allowing users to hold more than one address not linked to their real-world identity.It claims financial data on Libra transactions will be kept separate from user ad profiles, and that Calibra account information will not be used to improve ad targeting on Facebook-owned platforms.With Facebook's track record thus far, it's understandable that more than a few are wary of this new venture. CNBC reports that Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters said in a statement that the company is "continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users."Citing a lack of regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, she has requested the company pause work on Libra until Congress and regulators can examine the issues and take action.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANScientists have discovered a massive freshwater aquifer hidden beneath the Atlantic.According to a study published in Scientific Reports, Columbia University scientists used an electromagnetic receiver to survey offshore groundwater deposits below the Atlantic Ocean.The results reveal a reservoir of freshwater stretching from the coast of New Jersey to Massachusetts, extending out about 50 miles to the edge of the continental shelf. The reservoir begins some 600 feet below the ocean floor, and bottoms out at 1,200 feet.Researchers theorize that toward the end of the last ice age some 15 to 20,000 years ago, the world's water was locked in ice. Much of what is now the underwater U.S. continental shelf was exposed due to lower sea levels.When the ice melted, sediments formed river deltas over the shelf which trapped freshwater in scattered pockets. Sea levels then rose later on.The aquifer is not stagnant, and is likely fed by subterranean runoff from the land. It is also freshest near the shore, and becomes saltier farther out, suggesting that it gradually mixes with ocean water over time.Because of this, the water would first need to be desalinated before people can use it.While there's no need to dip into this reservoir at the moment, there may be other existing aquifers that could potentially represent a resource in drier regions like southern California, Australia, the Middle East, or sub-Saharan Africa.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This includes JAK inhibitors, which were found to reawaken resting hair follicles in mice when applied on the skin.Researchers had previously discovered a pathway called JAK-STAT in the stem cells of resting hair follicles that keeps them in a dormant state. By controlling pathway activity, JAK inhibitors can trigger follicle growth.According to the Columbia researchers, human hair follicles appeared after three weeks and started creating hair.The technique will be especially useful for hair restoration surgery, which currently relies on the redistribution of follicles from one part of the body to another.Using this new method, scientists can create "a grid of hairs that are patterned correctly and engineered so they can be transplanted back into that same patient's scalp."Hair follicles grown this way could allow for an unlimited supply, with no need for donor hair grafts.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. 3D-printed mold that mimics natural microenvironment of human hair cells 2.

So what in the galaxy are they and why haven't their origins been located before?Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are millisecond-long signals which are known to repeat. However, most are single burst, making them extremely challenging to localize. They come from all corners of the universe and were discovered in 2007, with 85 of them since detected. Nobody has been able to understand where they're coming from or what's causing them, until now.An Australian led team of astronomers have now located the galaxy from where one of these FRB waves originated, some 3.6 billion light-years away. The discovery was made using CSIRO's new Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, a radio telescope in Western Australia.CSIRO lead author Keith Bannister said, "This is the big breakthrough that the field has been waiting for since astronomers discovered fast radio bursts in 2007.So, how has this new technology allowed them to localize the radio signal?The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder is a design of multiple dish antennas. The burst had to travel a different distance to contact each dish, thus reaching them all at a somewhat different time, allowing for pinpoint accuracy.Adam Deller of Swinburne University of Technology said, "From these tiny time differences  just a fraction of a billionth of a second  we identified the burst's home galaxy and even its exact starting point, 13,000 light years out from the galaxy's center in the galactic suburbs."The cause of the burst remains unknown.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Holder was driven to the scene by a woman he was dating. The woman testified in court saying that she was amazed to see the rapper and got out of the car to ask for a picture, it was at this point she heard Holder turn the accusation onto Hussle.After the heated exchange, the woman said that she and Holder drove off and that's when Holder pulled out a gun and demanded she stop and wait at a certain location.

Its nitrogen-based atmosphere is similar to Earth's, albeit four times denser. Instead of water, lakes, rivers, and seas are filled with liquid methane.While the surface is composed of rock-hard ice, a liquid water reservoir exists beneath the crust.Dragonfly will have cameras on board to stream images taken during flight. It will also carry scientific instruments including spectrometers to study the moon's composition, meteorology sensors, and seismometers. Drills in the landing skids will take surface samples to be analyzed onboard.Dragonfly is not the first spacecraft to touch down on Saturn's largest moon.
