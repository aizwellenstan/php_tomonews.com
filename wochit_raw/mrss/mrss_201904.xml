According to Reuters, the 16-foot-tall (4.9 meter) Crew Dragon capsule was launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Kennedy space Center at 2:49 a.m. on Saturday and deployed into orbit 11 minutes later. According to the BBC, the Dragon test vehicle autonomously attached itself to the international docking adapter. The BBC reports the Crew Dragon approached the ISS using lasers and software to guide itself in, while astronauts aboard the space station monitored the docking.  According to BBC, the capsule's "soft capture" contact with the space station occurred at 10:51 GMT, with a full and secure docking confirmed around 10 minutes later. According to Reuters, the capsule was carrying 400 pounds of supplies and test equipment, and a test dummy named "Ripley."Ripley is equipped with sensors around the head, neck and spine to monitor how a flight would feel for a human. The Crew Dragon is scheduled to stay at the ISS for five days, while the three crew members of the space station perform tests on the capsule to see how it is holding up in space. On Friday morning, after being checked out and loaded with cargo, the capsule will undock from the ISS and then plunge back toward Earth. Parachutes will deploy during the capsule's decent, where it should plunge into the Atlantic Ocean near Florida for retrieval. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Dragon capsule being launched and floating in space2.

The scientists used mathematical models and computer simulations to map out the hypothetical planet's orbit after finding abnormal alignments of six objects in the Kuiper Belt suggesting that a larger object's gravity was pulling them.The Kuiper Belt is a ring of icy objects located beyond the orbit of Neptune. Within it are several thousand celestial bodies, several of which have their own moons.Planet Nine remains unseen. However, a paper published last month by the same Caltech team in the journal Physics Reports suggests that it could be detected within a decade.Results also showed that its mass is probably five to 10 times the mass of Earth.They estimate Planet Nine to be about 400 astronomical units away from the sun, which is the equivalent of 60 billion kilometers or 37 billion miles. These new estimates suggest that the planet is closer and potentially brighter than previously thought, making it easier to detect in the coming years.In a second paper published in the Astronomical Journal, the same group of researchers calculated the percentage of potential bias of their observations. Results showed the probability was just one in 500.In a Caltech press release, Konstantin Batygin, one of the lead researchers of both papers said, quote, 'The prospect of one day seeing real images of Planet Nine is absolutely electrifying. Although finding Planet Nine astronomically is a great challenge, I'm very optimistic that we will image it within the next decade.'RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Planet Nine orbit2. Kuiper belt3.

Both species can only see to light in the visible spectrum.According to the study, the pupils of the mice that received the nanoparticles injection were constricted. This meant their eyes were able to detect infrared light even during the day. Mice that only received a buffer solution did not have constricted pupils.Jin Bao, one of the researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China, explained in the study that nanoparticles were able to anchor to the photoreceptor cells in the eyes, also known as the rods and the cones, and convert the infrared light to make it appear as a green color.The nanoparticles do this by capturing the longer infrared wavelengths and sending out shorter wavelengths in the visible spectrum. This is then absorbed by a rod or a cone, which then sends sends a signal to the brain, tricking the brain into believing that visible light has hit the retina.This technology could be used in security and military operations in the future, according to the study.Senior author Tian Xue said in the study this technology is exciting because it could "eventually enable human beings to see beyond our natural capability."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, deployment was intended to test the U.S. military's ability to rapidly deploy such weapons around the world, according to a spokeswoman for U.S. European Command. According to Reuters, Lockheed Martin builds and integrates the THAAD system, which is designed to shoot down short- medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Raytheon builds its advanced radar. According to Army Technology, the THAAD system is designed to protect against incoming ballistic missiles at ranges of 200 kms and altitudes of up to 150 kms. According to Army Technology, the THAAD battery typically operates nine launch vehicles each carrying eight missiles, with two tactical operations centers and a ground-based radar. THAAD intercepts incoming ballistic missiles in their final phase of flight, according to Reuters. Radar first detects incoming threats, identifies the target and engages. An interceptor missile is fired from the launcher, and then uses kinetic energy to destroy the incoming missile.  According to Reuters, the deployment comes amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran over Israel's bombing campaign in Syria and comments in which Iran's foreign minister said he could not rule out the possibility of military conflict between the two countries.

The Guardian reports that blood tests have shown no signs of the virus for the past 18 months.Anton Pozniak, president of the International Aids Society, says the findings reaffirm the belief that AIDS is curable.He told the Guardian that the hope is there will eventually be a safe, cost-effective, and easy way to achieve results with gene technology or antibody techniques.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANResearchers have created a motion-powered, fireproof sensor that can track movements of people who work in high-risk environments like firefighters, steelworkers and miners, according to a McMaster University press release.  McMasters researchers, working with partners at other colleges, have created a low-cost sensor that is about the size of a button-cell battery. According to the release, the sensors can be incorporated into the sole of a boot or under the arm of a jacket, wherever motion creates a pattern of constant contact and release to generate the energy the sensor needs to function. By harvesting electricity from movement, the sensor uses triboelectric, or friction-generated, charging for power.The sensors can track the movement and location of a person in a burning building, a mineshaft or other hazardous locations, alerting those outside if movement stops. The key material in the sensor, a new carbon aerogel nanocomposite, is fireproof and never needs charging from a power source. The sensors have been successfully tested at temperatures up to 300 degrees Celsius without any loss of function. The development teamfrom McMaster, UCLA and University of Chemistry and Technology Praguedescribes the new device in a paper published in the journal Nano Energy. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It has such little value that paper mills that have been stripping lignin from wood for centuries merely dispose of it in boilers.During digestion, the bacteria turns lignin into 2-pyrone-4, 6-dicarboxylic acid, or PDC. By removing three genes from the microbe, University of Wisconsin-Madison scientists were able to make PDC the end point for the digestion process.UWM researcher Miguel Perez says bioengineers in Japan used PDC to make a variety of materials for consumer products, and found it performs the same or better than petroleum-based additives in PET polymers, like plastic bottles or synthetic fibers.As a plastic alternative, PDC would naturally break down in the environment, and also wouldn't leach compounds as it degrades.Researchers have so far managed to turn 59 percent of lignin's compounds into PDC, but suggest greater efficiency might be achieved with further gene-tweaking.The study is published in the journal Green Chemistry.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Citing unnamed police sources, state news agency Bernama reported that one woman sprayed chemicals on Kim Jong-Nam's face and immediately after, the second woman held a cloth over his face for 10 seconds. Reuters reported that traces of the deadly nerve agent VX was found on the women's clothing. VX blocks signals between the nervous system and the body's muscles. This causes muscular paralysis which results in death via asphyxiation.Malaysian officials also identified four other men at the airport who are suspected of being North Korean agents that directed the attack.The Washington Post reports that U.S. officials believe Huong and Aisyah were following direct orders from Pyongyang while Huong claims that she thought she was participating in a prank television show. Huang is believed to have been recruited by North Korean officials while working at a bar in Hanoi. North Korea has denied any type of involvement, however, the four agents who were identified by Malaysian officials fled the country soon after the attack took place.Kim Jong Nam and Kim Jong Un are both sons of former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, however, they were born to different mothers.\RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Reuters, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 left Bole Airport in Addis Ababa at 8:38 a.m. local time, before losing contact with the control tower at 8:44 a.m. According to data published by FlightRadar24, the plane took off in good weather and clear visibility and struggles to ascend at a stable speed. According to data published by FlightRadar24 on Twitter, during the first three minutes of flight, the vertical speed was unstable after take-off. According to chief executive of the airline Tewolde GebreMariam, the pilot had sent out a distress call and was cleared to return to the airport. After losing contact with air traffic controllers, the plane crashed into the ground near Bishoftu, a town southeast of the capital. Passengers from 33 countries were aboard the flight, said GebreMariam. According to Reuters, the aircraft, a 737 MAX 8, is the same Boeing model as the Lion Air flight that crashed in the Java Sea after take-off from Jakarta on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people on board.Boeing has said it is sending a technical team to help with the Ethiopian-led crash investigation.

Buildings are being painted in light colors to reflect heat instead of absorbing it.Carlo Becker, the architect of Berlin's Sponge City strategy, explained to Bloomberg that the idea is to use rain water to cool the city naturally by imitating the natural water cycle.The city also plans to add more green spaces and urban wetlands to efficiently absorb rain water.Heike Stock, the official in charge of managing the program, told Deutsche Welle the idea of the urban sponge is to "avoid sealing up too much of the ground surface with concrete or tarmac" and to allow water to be absorbed into the ground through permeable surfaces.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This suggests the plane wasn't responding to inputs, and pilots were losing control of the aircraft.Witnesses interviewed by Reuters said they had seen smoke billowing out behind the plane, and heard a loud rattling noise, like straining and shaking metal.The farmer whose field the plane crashed in said it made a sharp turn above a field of panicked cows, while another eyewitness claimed it was trailing clothes and papers as well as smoke.The aircraft was trying to climb and lift its nose, according to two other witnesses, but failed and crashed nose-first into the ground before then exploding.According to Reuters, the debris field was roughly the size of two soccer fields.Reuters reports that investigators have recovered the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, which will be sent overseas for scrutiny.

But in recent years, they have identified surface water in sparse molecule populations bound to regolith, or lunar soil.Observations gathered by an instrument on NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter indicate that water moves around the dayside of the moon.Water molecules remain bound to the regolith until surface temperatures peak during lunar noon. They then thermally desorb and either bounce to a nearby location that is cold enough, or stick to the moon's weak atmosphere until temperatures drop and they can return to the surface.Scientists have hypothesized that hydrogen ions in the solar wind may be generating most of the moon's water. But as the supply doesn't decrease even when the moon is shielded from solar winds, it suggests water builds up over time instead of raining directly down.A paper detailing the findings has been published in the journal Geophysical Research LettersPlanetary Science Institute senior scientist and lead author Amanda Hendrix says lunar water can be used to make fuel or for radiation shielding or thermal management. This could make future missions more affordable as these materials don't need to be launched from Earth.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Recent Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes unrelated says aviation expert</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions or custom animation requests, contact tips@nextanimation.com.tw. Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANEthiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on Sunday shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board. The Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft was the same type involved in the Indonesia Lion Air Flight 610 crash five months earlier. Despite some similarities between the two crashes, aviation expert Peter Lemme talking to Scientific American believes they are unrelated.Both flights appeared to have difficulties sustaining a normal climb, and fell shortly after takeoff.A possible cause of the Indonesia crash was a malfunction in the automated anti-stalling feature called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. According to Scientific American, because Boeing outfitted the Max with bigger engines, their placement relative to the plane's center of gravity causes a tendency for the nose to tip upward. The MCAS is designed to automatically push the nose back down when this happens, preventing the aircraft from stalling, or losing lift.  In the case of Lion Air, experts suspect a faulty sensor may have triggered MCAS to engage when the plane was flying normally, causing the nose to repeatedly dip. Using data from FlightRadar24, Lemme studied how Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 flew in the six minutes before disappearing from radar. With Flight 302, the plane got to 1,000 feet, which at that point lost about 400 feet of altitude. The plane then flew level for about 30 seconds, about 500 to 600 feet above the ground, which according to Lemme is not normal.  The airspeed continued to increase to over 300 knots at under 1,000 feet above ground. After that 30-second period, the plane began to climb normally until they disappeared from radar. Now that the black boxes have been recovered from Flight 302, investigators will see what information they reveal about the cause of the crash. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Qubits are represented by a one, a zero or both at the same time.During the first stage of the experiment, the two qubits were unaltered. In the second stage, scientists used a computer program to alter the order of the previous stage, causing the qubits to become a random assortment of ones and zeros.This process is then followed by the time reversal stage during which the program reverses the chaotic effect on the qubits. Finally, the qubit reverts to the original state before it had been altered by the program. The program restored 85 percent of the cases where two qubits where involved.The team was able to create a state that evolved against the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the state of entropy in the universe increases over time.

The barrier acts as a shield to retain water in our bodies and keep pathogens out.In younger skin, inflammatory cytokines are released to help repair cracks in the barrier.As the skin ages and the barrier weakens, more cytokines are released by the immune system.Cytokines eventually enter the bloodstream, and according to the study can cause inflammation that affects the rest of the body.The study had 33 participants between the ages of 58 and 95. They were asked to apply moisturizer twice a day for a month.The moisturizer contained cholesterol, free fatty acids and ceramides  all of which are essential for skin health.The scientists observed that the cytokine levels of the participants were found to be nearly equivalent with people in their thirties at the end of one month.In a news release the University of California, San Francisco said the researchers now plan to conduct a large scale study to test if moisturizing creams can actually delay or prevent age-related diseases caused by inflammation.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to Asia Times, the 737 Max series is equipped with new CFM Leap-1B engines, which forced re-engineering of part of the airplane. Fitting the new engines meant moving them forward and lengthening the front landing gear to keep the engines from scraping the ground. This changed the plane's center of gravity and also altered the airflow on the wings.  The new, heavier and larger engines resulted in Max planes having a strong tendency to pitch nose up, which is why the MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, was introduced. According to Asia Times, MCAS was a suboptimal fix to the pitch problem created by relocating the newer engines. It is designed to push the nose down and prevent the plane from going into a stall. MCAS was intended to deal only with a specific flight risk.    RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Boeing 737 Max 8 plane and LEAP 1B engines2. New engines caused parts of the plane to be re-engineered 3.

More and more research suggests this conveyor belt system is slowing down, causing some scientists to fear it could cause temperatures to plummet in Europe and warming waters off the east coast of the U.S.According to a Columbia University press release, a new study published in Nature Communications has provided insight into how quickly changes in Atlantic Ocean circulation could affect major climate changes.  The study was carried out by researchers at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, working with the Norwegian Research Center. It was the first to precisely calculate the time lags between past changes to the ocean conveyor belt and major climate changes.The study looked at the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, and specifically focused on a section where water sinks from the surface to the bottom of the North Atlantic. Researchers took sediment core samples drilled from the bottom of the Norwegian Sea, a lake sediment core from southern Scandinavia, and ice cores from Greenland. Comparing data from the three cores revealed that the AMOC started weakening about 400 years before a major cold snap 13,000 years ago. It began strengthening again about 400 years before an abrupt warming 11,000 years ago.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation or AMOC2.

      <title>The 1989 US Exxon Oil Spill: Animated explainer</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska was one of the biggest U.S. oil spills ever to occur, according to the Atlantic.It's been thirty years since the waters of Bligh Reef in Alaska were contaminated with more than 11 million gallons of crude oil after an Exxon oil tanker impacted the reef's seabed. Today we revisit how the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill happened.According to The Atlantic, on March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker was entering Alaska's Prince William Sound. It had departed from the Trans Alaska Pipeline terminal on March 23 at 9:12 pm and was carrying 53.1 million gallons of oil.At 12:04 am the tanker slammed into Bligh Reef, tearing open its hull and spilling 11 million gallons of oil into the water and the surrounding environment. That's the equivalent of 17 Olympic-sized swimming pools.According to Scientific American, nearly 2,000 kilometers of the shoreline were contaminated. Wildlife in the area was also severely damaged. Thousands of otters, harbor seals, seabirds and fish were killed.According to the Environmental Protection Agency, three methods were used to clean up the spill: burning the oil on the water's surface, mechanical cleanup via oil skimmers and chemical dispersants.High-pressure hot water was also used to clean the surrounding beaches until it was determined that it was cooking microorganisms present in the shores which in turn damaged the soil.According to a case study by the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited, Exxon Mobil had to pay $4.3 billion as a consequence of the spill in addition to the $2 billion it spent the first year on clean-up efforts.The Exxon Valdez oil spill is the second largest spill in history second to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, where an explosion at a BP oil rig killed eleven workers and spilled 53,000 barrels of oil per day for three months.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Crashed 737 Max planes lacked safety features that Boeing sold as extras</title>

Visit http://archive.nextanimationstudio.com to view News Direct's complete archive of 3D news animations.RESTRICTIONS: Broadcast: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWAN Digital: NO USE JAPAN, NO USE TAIWANThe doomed 737 Max jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia were not equipped with two notable safety features because Boeing charged an additional cost to install them.According to the New York Times, the MCAS software on the Boeing 737 Max takes readings from one of two angle of attack sensors on the plane that aligns itself with oncoming airflow.If MCAS detects that the plane is pointed up at a dangerous angle, it automatically swivels the horizontal stabilizer and pushes the nose down to prevent stalling.Two optional safety features could have kept the MCAS in check: the angle of attack indicator displays readings from both sensors, and the disagree light activates when the sensors' data do not match.Both features were sold by Boeing as optional extras and were not included on the crashed Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines planes.According to the New York Times, the safety features could have helped pilots detect any erroneous readings. This would have also allowed a manual override of the system.The Times, citing a Boeing bulletin, says this can be done by temporarily counteracting the MCAS movement, cutting off electrical power to the stabilizers, and then cranking a wheel to manually pull them back to the correct position.Experts told the newspaper that the two features are vital for flight safety. But because neither is mandated by the FAA, Boeing was able to sell them as upgrades.The company has since announced that it will make the disagree light standard on all new 737 aircrafts, but the angle of attack indicator will remain an optional extra that airlines can buy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Construction for the first one starts this year.According to Asia Times, Chinese authorities have officially announced plans to start building the first floating nuclear power plant in the South China Sea. These are designed to power surrounding artificial islands being built in the region.Floating nuclear power plants are offshore platforms containing small nuclear reactors built to power hard to reach islands or islets.Roughly 20 floating nuclear stations could be built to power troops and residents in the  Spratly and Paracel islands. These regions are disputed between China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.Asia Times reports that the first floating nuclear reactor will be functional and sea-worthy by 2021. A prototype is currently being tested off the coast of China's Shandong province.According to Chinese state news agency, Xinhua Net, the first floating nuclear power platform would cost roughly US$2.1 billion.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

In 2016, the water temperature in Disko Bay cooled, reaching temperatures that were lower than in the late 1980s.The team used an ocean model to trace the cool water to a current that carries water around Greenland's southern tip, and northward along its west coast.The Associated Press reports that according to study co-author and NASA climate scientist Josh Willis, the findings indicate that glacier retreats and advances are much more sensitive to ocean temperatures than previously thought.  Temperatures are still rising slowly from global warming, and with over 90 percent of heat trapped by greenhouse gases going to the oceans, melting will be worse in the long run.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According the FleetMon, the Palau-flagged tanker Elhiblu 1 was traveling from Turkey to Tripoli, Libya on Tuesday when it was diverted to a distressed migrant boat off the Libyan coast. According to DW News, the tanker rescued the migrants and resumed sailing toward Tripoli.  According to Salvini, when the ship was six nautical miles from port, it changed course toward Malta. According to Maltese authorities, the vessel is believed to be carrying 108 migrants made up of 77 men and 31 women. Maltese authorities confirmed the ship had been hijacked and said Maltese authorities were monitoring its progress and would not allow the vessel to dock in Malta.

The two aircrafts were seen guarded by a contingent of Venezuelan national guardsmen.According to the BBC, Venezuelan journalist Javier Mayorca wrote on Twitter that 100 Russian troops disembarked with 35 tonnes of equipment.Russian military experts in the Guardian say the cargo plane may have been carrying spare parts. Venezuela was once one of the largest importers of Russian arms, and has warplanes, missiles and other weapons in its arsenal that require maintenance.According to the Guardian, Russia is one of Venezuela's main allies, and has provided diplomatic, economic and military support to the embattled administration of Nicolas Maduro.In December, Russia signaled its support for the oil-rich country by sending two TU-160 bombers to take part in a joint military exercise.The U.S. has repeatedly called for Maduro to resign, instead recognizing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's interim president.According to Reuters, the State Department condemned the Russian military deployment to Caracas, calling it a "reckless escalation of the situation."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also told his Russian counterpart in a phone call to stop its "unconstructive behavior," warning that the U.S. and its allies "will not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to the BBC, the funds are the first under the national emergency declared by President Trump to bypass Congress in order to fund his promised border wall. According to Reuters, the Pentagon chief said on Monday the money would go toward planning and building a 57-mile section of "pedestrian fencing," improved roads and lighting along the border. According to CNN, the Department of Defense authorized the Army Corp of Engineers to begin planning and construction for the project on Monday night. According to Reuters, acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan said in a memo to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirsthen Nielsen that the Department of Defense had the authority to support counter-narcotics near international boundaries. Shanahan authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin planning and executing the project that involves building 57-miles of 18-foot-high fencing, constructing and improving roads, and installing lighting within the Yuma and El Paso sections of border.

CNN reports that the exoplanet lies closest to its host star, and takes 40 to 50 years to make a full orbit.Using the GRAVITY instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer, ESO scientists found that HR8799e is a 'super-Jupiter.' It is much more massive than any planet in our solar system, but also younger.Due to leftover energy from its formation and a powerful greenhouse effect, the temperature on HR8799e is an inhospitable 1000 degrees Celsius or about 1,616 Fahrenheit.According to ESO, analysis showed that the exoplanet's atmosphere has more carbon monoxide than methane.Clouds of iron and silicate dust were also found, which when combined with the excess carbon monoxide, suggests a huge, violent storm in HR8799e's atmosphere.CNN reports that researchers are planning long-term follow up observations of HR8799e, and can study it more to learn more about the formation of planets and planetary systems.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The middle layer contains the contraceptive hormone in solid form, while the outer layer is a skin adhesive that allows the hormone to be transferred.Once it is in the skin, the contraceptive drug moves into the bloodstream and can then circulate through the body.The earring patches were tested on pigs' ears and the skin of hairless rats by being applied for 16 hours and removed for eight.While drug levels dropped when the earrings were off, the patches were found to produce the necessary amounts of the hormone in the blood.The technology has yet to be tested on humans, but if ultimately used in the future, the patches would have be changed periodically, most likely on a weekly basis.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to The Guardian, Fondomonte Farms, a subsidiary from a Saudi Arabian food conglomerate called Almarai, owns 16 percent of the irrigated land in Blythe, California. They use this land to grow alfalfa which is then exported to Saudi Arabia as feed for the company's cows.Blythe is an arid region in California, however, its land is irrigated by the lower Colorado River. This river is also the main water supply for nearly 40 million people. Currently, the river is drying up due to climate change.According to The Guardian, Fondomonte Farms is using a loop-hole from a law dating back to the 1800s to benefit from the scarce water supply in the region for free. An 1877 water claim approved by the government allowed farmers and those living within the district to consume as much water as they needed for free due to the shortage of water in Blythe.The Palo Verde Irrigation District cannot sell the water in the area, they can only charge farmers $77 per acre-foot to cover the water district's overhead.
