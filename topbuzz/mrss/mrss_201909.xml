        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SHANGHAI  Costco opened its very first physical store in China last week to quite a bit of pandemonium. According to Liberty Times, so many shoppers tried to squeeze in on day one it was forced to close early, with some people waiting up to three hours just to get into the parking lot.  Liberty Times reported one blogger posted pictures onto Chinese social media showing some parts of the store in pretty bad shape thanks to kind, considerate shoppers. Several boxes of food were found to have been opened and eatenand then just put back or left in other parts of the store, such as sushi trays with half the sushi gone or boxes with nibbled on or missing muffins. Other photos show customers carelessly leaving items that need refrigeration randomly around the stores like frozen chicken, sushi and milk.    Who hasn't been to Costco when you suddenly need to hit the head? Thank god that's what the bathroom is for.      Unfortunately for one mother, she felt that the closest garbage can would suffice for her daughter instead.Costco may have entered China, but now it looks like China has also entered Costco.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  American architectural company SmithGroup has won a design competition for San Francisco's public toilets.The structure is called AmeniTREES and consists of a toilet and a green roof with vegetation, according to SmithGroup's website.An irrigation system underneath the green roof will collect rainwater. The collected water will be filtered and stored in a storage tank.

According to KK News, Liao dominated with a time of 53.25 in the 400 meter dash, while Tong was nipping at her heels the entire race, finishing number two with a time of 53.35 seconds. KK News reported last month Liao and Tong were also part of a team from Hunan that won the women's 4X400 relay event at the National Athletics Championships in Shenyang.Apparently, after images of the two ran onto China's INTRANET, accusations started flying that both were actually men.

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HONG KONG  China has sent a fresh batch of troops into Hong Kong in what Beijing is calling a "routine rotation."The People's Liberation Army's Hong Kong Garrison conducted a rotation of its soldiers in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong on Thursday morning at 4:00 a.m.This is the 22nd rotation since the Chinese army began garrisoning the city after the handover in 1997, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.Military vehicles of the People's Liberation Army were seen passing Huanggang Port, a port of entry between mainland China and Hong Kong. The Chinese military is prepared to "maintain stability and prosperity" in the city amid ongoing protests, reports Xinhua.Images shared by Xinhua show the Hong Kong Garrison had changed its armored vehicles from a Type 092 military version to the WJ-03B. According to the South China Morning Post, this model is typically used by armed police officers for the purpose of controlling riots.The Chinese air force also sent in armed helicopters later on Thursday morning.As Hong Kong has been rocked by months of anti-government and pro-democracy protests, many are wary of China's next step. Beijing is keen on putting an end to the protests before October 1, which marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Reuters reports.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, CALIFORNIA  At least eight people are dead and dozens more missing after a boat caught fire off the California coast.According to CBS LA, the 75-foot long charter dive boat 'Conception' was anchored near California's Santa Cruz Island on Monday, carrying 6 crew members and 33 passengers.At around 3:15 a.m., a mayday call went out alerting authorities to a fire onboard.The LA Times reports that many of the passengers were sleeping below deck when the blaze broke out. Five crew members who were awake and on the deck escaped by jumping into the water, and were later rescued by a good Samaritan vessel.The Ventura County Fire Department tried to extinguish the flames that had completely engulfed the Conception. The boat eventually sank in 64 feet of water, some 20 yards offshore.CNN reports that according to U.S. Coast Guard officials, the Conception is currently inverted on the ocean floor.So far, four bodies have been recovered and four more seen on the ocean floor near the sunken vessel. 26 people are still unaccounted for.The cause of the blaze is also as yet unknown. Authorities are still mounting search and rescue operations, and will do so until dawn tomorrow.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[PERTH, AUSTRALIA  A trainee pilot amazingly made an emergency landing after his instructor passed out mid-flight. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Max Sylvester was training in a Cessna aircraft at the Jandakot Airport on Saturday afternoon in Perth when his instructor suddenly fell unconscious. Max then calmly called air traffic control and informed them of his situation. "He's leaning over my shoulder, I'm trying to keep him up but he keeps falling down," Sylvester told the controller.  Did we forget to mention that it was his first lesson in the two-seater aircraft? According to ABC News Australia, the air traffic controller kept the 29-year-old calm as he talked him through how to get his bee-hind safely back on the ground.The operator asks, "Do you know how to operate the airplane?""This is my first lesson," Max tells the guy. ABC News reports that the controller then told Sylvester how to reduce the plane's speed, then how to go about landing. With air traffic control with him every step of the way, Max was able to safely land. His instructor, Robert Mollard, is now at the hospital in stable condition. So what's Lesson Two going to cover?]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SPAIN  There's an uptick of excessively hairy Spanish children thanks to a drug mix-up that saw the poor young uns drinking hair loss meds.According to The Guardian, at least 17 kids, including a couple of babies, began growing fuzz on their forehead, cheeks, arms, legs, and hands  a rare condition known as werewolf syndrome. Doctors figured out that all the kids had been given a medicated syrup called omeprazole for their gastric reflux. Only problem is, the drug isn't exactly known for triggering hair growth spurts, so what gives?Turns out the syrup inside wasn't for acid reflux. Some genius at a laboratory had apparently put anti-baldness drugs into the wrong bottles, and distributed it to pharmacies as omeprazole. Authorities withdrew the bad batch of drugs from the market, and closed the lab that screwed it up.While the mishap left the kids' liver slightly worse for wear, it's nothing serious. The wee werewolves should also find themselves reverting back to their old selves pretty soon, now that they've stopped taking the meds.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA  Google's Project Zero has uncovered a hacking operation in which websites carry malware that steal sensitive data from iPhones if users simply visit the site.The research, which was made public in a Project Zero blog post, had uncovered a total of 14 different vulnerabilities across different iPhone operating systems from iOS10 to iOS12. The malicious websites would exploit the server and attack the users' device to install a monitoring implant, according to a blogpost by Project Zero. Once the implant was successfully installed, users had their passwords exposed as well as their chat histories on apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and iMessage.Hackers were also able to access a person's contacts, Gmail database and their location.Google had informed Apple about security issues on its phones, reports the Guardian.  Apple then released a new operating system update in which once users updated their iPhones, the malware was removed.Project Zero did not name the infected websites or the number of victims of the attack.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[JUNEAU, ALASKA  U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is pushing for the commercialization of America's largest national forest for potential mining and logging opportunities.President Trump is looking to exempt the Tongass National Forest from logging restrictions that were put into place by the Clinton administration, the Washington Post reports, citing three unnamed people that were briefed on the issue.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, under the policy, road construction and timber harvesting is not allowed on roadless areas in designated national forests. Congress had designated more than 5.7 million acres of the Alaskan forest land as wilderness that cannot be developed any circumstances, reports the Washington Post. If President Trump's administration succeeds, around 9.5 millions acres of Alaskan forest land could be affected.According to the Washington Post, the move would open up the Alaskan rainforest to potential logging, mining and energy projects.Ecologists pointed out that the forest is home to animals such as the brown bears, Sitka black-tailed deer and the Northern Goshawk, among other species. Chris Wood, president of Trout Unlimited, an environmental group, said that the region's salmon fishing industry could also be impacted as many wild salmon are spawn in Tongass National park.Previously, only specific projects approved by the U.S. Forest Service were allowed to take place in the Alaskan forest.]]></videoDesc>

While reviewing the rover's images, a Chang'e 4 team member noticed that one crater seemed to contain a material distinct from the rest of the lunar surface.The Yutu-2 was directed to approach the crater and examine its inside with its Visible and Near-Infrared Spectrometer.Mission scientists have not revealed what the substance is, describing it only as gel-like and with an unusual color.Outside researchers have suggested that one possible explanation is that the substance is melted glass created from meteorites striking the surface of the moon.China's Chang'e 4 spacecraft successfully made the first-ever soft landing on the far side of the moon on January 3. The Yutu-2 rover is now on its ninth lunar day, with each day equivalent to two Earth weeks.In May, Chinese scientists also announced that they'd found evidence of material from the lunar mantle in the regolith of the moon's Von Karman crater.]]></videoDesc>

According to the BBC, at least seven people are dead in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian wreaked major havoc and devastated the island nation.As is the new normal these days, people took to social media to react  some far less appropriately than others. Cue instagrammers hijacking the Bahamas geotag and Hurricane Dorian hashtag to post vacation throwbacks and sexy bikini snaps.The tone-deaf 'grammers claim they're merely spreading awareness of the tragedy, though we're not quite sure if they meant the hurricane or themselves.Needless to say, the stunt did not sit well with a lot of folks, who immediately called out the insensitive behavior for what it is  shameless self-promotion. Why the hell else would we need a butt close-up shoved in our faces?If you really, honestly want to help, quit with the "thoughts and prayers" schtick. That's not going to rebuild the Bahamas, donations will.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NASHVILLE  A private Catholic school in Nashville has exorcised the Harry Potter books from its library because apparently they contain real spells. The Tennessean reported that pastor Rev. Dan Reehill at Saint Edwards Catholic School parish sent an email out to parents saying that after consulting with a bunch of exorcists in the U.S. and Rome, they suggested that Harry and the gang be excommunicated. In the email, Reehil wrote, "these books present magic as both good and evil, which is not true, but in fact a clever deception. The curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells; which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text."According to the Guardian, the seven-part Harry Potter series was published between 1997 and 2007. It had spells and curses like "avada kedavra" the killing curse; "crucio", the torture curse; and "imperio", which allows wizards to control people's actions. According to the Tennessean, Dumbledore and Professor Snape were still casting spells from the school library last term, but were made to vanish after Saint Edwards opened up a new library. Superintendent of schools for the Catholic diocese Rebecca Hammel told the Tennessean that Reehil was in his authority to say no to Harry and J.K. Rowling. She also added, "we really don't get into censorship in such selections other than for making sure that what we put in our school libraries are age-appropriate materials for our classrooms." Well thank god no one equates getting rid of books with censorship.]]></videoDesc>

Synthetic fiber and bits of red and blue plastic were found in the lake's waters, according to the Los Angeles Times.Researchers used pumps, funnels, tubing and filters to collect water samples from six different locations across Lake Tahoe.Once the plastic particles were gathered in the water filters, the scientists oxidized organic matters such as insects, twigs and algae. They then used a high-density liquid separation method to separate the sediments from the microplastics.According to the Reno Gazette Journal, the team is now in the process of examining the microplastics and identifying the different types of plastics and where they came from.The research team will present its findings to the American Geophysical Union in December.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[FLORIDA  The potential category 4 Hurricane Dorian may be barreling toward the continental U.S., but the unusual storm's final landfall destination remains difficult to predict.    The Tampa Bay Times reports that Hurricane Dorian had initially been forecast to directly hit Florida's east coast. But the next day, forecasts showed the storm's center drifting east of the state, and then later edging a bit back to the west.Experts have said Dorian's path has been especially unpredictable, and here's why.National Weather Service meteorologist Lance Wood told Live Science that the Atlantic high pressure system steering Hurricane Dorian started to weaken on the west side.Weakened winds have led to the storm moving very slowly at just 7 miles per hour. This puts its approach further into the future and makes forecasting its track more difficult.According to the Weather Channel, Dorian is expected to turn north as a gap opens up between the high-pressure Bermuda High system in the Atlantic and a low pressure system from the Great Lakes region.The timing and angle of the turn will depend on its interactions with the Bermuda High system, which forecasters have limited knowledge of and thus cannot accurately project.According to NWS meteorologist Joel Cline, the most likely scenario is that Dorian will miss Florida's east coast and move northward toward Georgia. It is then expected to either pass close to or make landfall in South Carolina or North Carolina.The Los Angeles Times reports that if the storm does push toward the U.S. East coast, there is a potential for heavy rain and with it, damage from storm surges and flooding.This means anyone living in an area that could potentially be hit or affected by Dorian's rampage had best be prepared for the worst.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SCOTTBURGH, SOUTH AFRICA  A scuba diver is amazingly still around after he had a bit of an accident involving a spear gun bolt and his dome. According to the South Coast Herald, South African pastor Connie Hallowell was in the water collecting fishing sinkers near Scottburgh Beach on August 31.Hallowell brought his spear gun and put it down on the ocean floor next to him.  Talking to East Coast Radio, the 48-year-old said a big wave came and surprised him and it knocked the gun against some reef causing the two-meter long spear to discharge into his face. As far as lucky shots go, this was definitely one in a million, as the spear somehow managed to miss Hallowell's eyes and brain.He was able to crawl back onto the beach where locals brought an angle grinder to help shorten the spear. Hallowell was first airlifted to one hospital before being transferred to another hospital in Pietermaritzburg where the bolt was finally removed. The guy must secretly be Iron Man because he's already out of the hospital giving interviews.  He told the Sunday Tribune that he has no plans to quit spearfishing and is already planning his next trip.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NANNING, CHINA   That's nuts. A police sniper positioned himself between the legs of a colleague and took out a man holding a woman hostage. The hostage situation took place on August 9th in Nanning when the 18-year-old suspect named Huang, was loitering in the subway station before randomly selecting a woman... and grabbing her.Chinese media outlet, Boxun News reports that during a two-hour stand-off with police, the suspect asked for a gun. Chief negotiator Qi Hongwei told local reporters that he asked the suspect where he was from and why he was doing this. Qi continued with, "I asked him to let the girl go and offered him water, but he said no to everything."Captain Hao, head of the Nanning SWAT First Tactical Unit, was instructed to take out the man after negotiations broke down. Hao can be seen laying behind one of his colleagues getting ready so the hostage-taker wouldn't spot him.Hao successfully took out the target.  Crucially, the hostage was unhurt.Captain Hao was awarded second-class merit by the Guangxi police for his bravery in the incident.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[VIENNA  A new study has found small pieces of plastic, ranging from 50 to 500 micrometers in size, present in human stool samples.Researchers from the Medical University of Vienna tested fecal samples from eight different participants aged 33 to 65. The participants came from Japan, Russia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Finland and Austria. The scientists found that all eight stool samples tested positive for microplastics.They identified nine different plastic types in the samples, with polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate being the most common type of plastic. On average, the samples contained 20 microplastic particles for every 10 grams of human stool.The participants' food diaries have shown that all of them could have been exposed to plastic via food wrappers and plastic bottles. Six of the eight participants had also consumed fish from the ocean.The researchers noted that the study had its limitations with only eight participants and eight samples. The study concluded that further research is needed to find out the impact of microplastics on human health.]]></videoDesc>

However, it looks as if not everyone is quite ON BOARD yet with using your phone to pay for things. Case in pointthis guy from Guangzhou.In video posted to Twitter knockoff Weibo, the man is seen getting on the bus, only problem is, he's not really sure where to scan his phone to pay for his ride. The bus driver points to the phone scanner, but for some reason the man thinks he's pointing at the coin drop box. So what does the man do? He just drops his entire phone into the coin box.That's one way to make a mobile payment, unfortunately not the correct one. And because the bus driver couldn't open the coin box by himself, the man had to wait until the end of the work day to retrieve his precious phone.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM  A new study found that a teenager in the U.K. went blind after eating nothing but junk food since elementary school.The unnamed boy got into a habit of only consuming french fries, white bread and Pringles chips, CNN reports. His diet also included slices of processed meats and sausage.When the boy turned 14, the teen found himself feeling unusually tired and paid a visit to the doctor. He was found to have anemia and low vitamin B12 levels. The doctors gave him some vitamin injections and advice on how to improve his diet.A year later doctors found signs of hearing and vision loss but they weren't able to link it to his poor diet, because the boy had a normal body mass index and showed no signs of malnutrition, from the outside.By the time the doctors realized his questionable eating habits had everything to do with his worsening health, it was too late, the teen had become permanently blind  at the age of 17.According to a press release by the researchers, the boy had developed a case of nutritional optic neuropathy, which is actually reversible if caught at an early stage.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TEHRAN, IRAN  Tehran is taking another step away from a 2015 nuclear accord by planning new nuclear centrifuges for enriching uranium.According to Reuters, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani announced that Iran will begin developing centrifuges to speed up the enrichment of uranium used to fuel power plants.According to the BBC, low-enriched uranium with a concentration of three to five percent is used to produce fuel for nuclear plants. Weapons-grade uranium is at least 90% enriched.Reuters reports that under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, Iran kept limited quantities of first-generation centrifuges at two nuclear power plants. A more advanced centrifuge would allow for faster uranium enrichment for a potential nuclear bomb.After the U.S. withdrew from the deal last year, it imposed sanctions against Iran that slashed the country's crude oil sales by about 80 percent.In response, Iran violated two key nuclear commitments in July  breaching the 600-pound limit on its low-enriched uranium stockpile and exceeding the cap on the purity of its uranium stocks.Rouhani had threatened to take further measures by September 5 unless France and the other European signatories of the nuclear accord did more to protect Iran from the sanctions.France had proposed a $15-billion credit line to finance Tehran's oil sales if it would return to compliance with the 2015 deal. But the plan was rebuffed by the U.S., which has refused to ease economic sanctions, and even imposed new ones to target Iranian oil smuggling.According to state TV,  Rouhani said the new measures will be "peaceful, under surveillance of the U.N. nuclear watchdog." It is also reversible if the European signatories keep their promises.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  A new study has found that the role for which a dog is bred is also reflected in their brain structure.The Washington Post reports that selective breeding by humans has led to diverse physical and behavioral variations in dogs. And now, new research has found it has also altered the way their brains are built.A study published in JNeurosci looked at the MRI scans of 62 dogs from 33 different breeds, and found that brains varied in form and size from breed to breed.Using American Kennel Club data, researchers grouped the canines based on the original intention for their breed, such as scent hunting, herding, or explicit companionship.They then examined areas of the dogs' brains that varied most across breeds and  mapped out six distinct brain networks each linked to certain functions.Anatomical variations in the brain networks were associated with variations in behavior. For example, network two, which involves the sense of smell, correlated significantly with scent hunting.In the future, the team hopes to better understand why dogs of the same breed can themselves display diverse behaviors, or what specifically makes a high-skill performer versus a low-skill performer.]]></videoDesc>

Thank god Taiwan isn't one of them. NextShark reported that a Facebook post showed the mulatto mooncakes available at the Saigon Center Mall in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. According to Sophie Tran's Facebook post, she described the Orea mooncake as "very sweet."America's national flavor.Apparently, Oreo mooncakes have been around for a couple of years and rear their ugly heads during Mid-Autumn. Past flavors have included Brownie Chocolate, Double Chocolate with Milk, Strawberry Jam, and Custard and Pineapple Jam. According to Mothership, the Oreo moon monstrosities are also available in Singapore and cost about $16.90 for a box with four different mooncakes.   Hopefully Oreo can keep up the creative streak. Perhaps Oreo-flavored sushi? Oreo hot pot?]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, said U.S. manufacturing activity declined for the first time in three years, amid trade tensions with China.The Institute for Supply Management's U.S. purchasing managers' index fell to 49.1 last month from 51.2 in July, reports Reuters. Figures below 50 indicate that the manufacturing sector is contracting.The reports come amid last week's reports that U.S. consumer spending increased in July.Nine industries including furniture, machinery and chemical products experienced growth last month, Reuters reports, citing the Institute for Supply Management. Seven other industries including electrical equipment, appliances and components all reported a contraction.U.S. President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on goods from China may have contributed to shrinkage in the manufacturing sector, according to Bloomberg. The manufacturing makes up around 12 percent of the American economy, Reuters reports. The U.S. now joins Japan, China and the United Kingdom as countries that are experiencing a decline in manufacturing activity.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  Crazy Rich Asians may have been groundbreaking for lots of reasons, but trumping ye old Hollywood pay gap is not one of 'em.According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film's co-writer Adele Lim has dropped out of the sequel, after the studio lowballed her.Sources say writer Peter Chiarelli was offered $800,000 to a million, but that the starting offer for Lim was a measly $110,000.Studio execs justified the pay disparity by pulling out the experience card. But while Crazy Rich Asians may be the first feature film Lim has penned, she's got loads of TV writing credits and is hardly "inexperienced." Plus, the success of the first film should speak for itself. If execs think the tired rom-com plot is what people came for, they should re-watch that mahjong scene.The problem, says Lim, is that women of color are rarely credited with crafting the main story. Instead, they're mostly used as "soy sauce" to garnish the screenplay with culturally specific details.After Lim walked away, the studio spent the next five months looking for another Asian to replace her, as if just any old Asian would do.Eventually, they came crawling back to Lim with an offer from Chiarelli to split his fee with her.She gave them a hard no, reasoning that what she makes shouldn't depend on the white-guy-writer's generosity.Right on. Be like Adele, ladies. Don't be soy sauce.]]></videoDesc>

NPR reported that according to a complaint filed by the FTC and the New York attorney general, YouSuck allegedly collected info of children watching YouTube kids videos without telling their parents or getting their okay, breaking laws that protect children's privacy. YouMakeThemMoney earned millions of dollars by then using this data to bombard the kids with super annoying targeted ads. Ahhow socially responsible of YouTool.The complaint also said YouTube marketed itself as a top destination for kids in presentations to companies making kids stuff. YouSpy told Mattel that "YouTube is today's leader in reaching children aged 6 to 11 against top TV channels." 6 YEARS OLD?  YouTracking told Hasbro that YouTube is the "#1 website regularly visited by kids." YouCaughtUs said that in about four months it will stop serving personalized ads on kids content.  4 months?But don't worry, Google and YouTube will continue to roll out other innovative ways to make money off the mountains of data it has on you and your kids.]]></videoDesc>

Since then, all the crows in the neighborhood have been dead set on revenge, marking Kewat as public enemy number one with their beaks every time he leaves his house.He didn't think the attacks were a coordinated plan at first, but soon realized the birds weren't going after anyone else in the village.After learning the hard way that crows are super smart, hold long grudges, and have mad facial recognition skillz, the poor man now carries around a stick when he goes out to defend himself from any aerial ambush.Kewat hopes the birds can forgive and forget, but I mean, they are called a murder of crows, so maybe not.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HOUSTON  The Justice Department has charged a man in Houston with possession of a machine gun, specifically a bump stock, in the first known case since the ban came into effect in March.Ajay Dhingra was indicted by a federal grand jury on four counts of firearm violations, according to a statement from the Southern District of Texas. The 43-year-old was noticed by the Secret Service as he sent an email to the George W. Bush foundation and asked the former president to "send one of your boys to come and murder me," the Associated Press reports, citing court records. Agents from the Secret Service visited Dhingra when he told them that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia.They searched his house and found a handgun, an AR-15 rifle with an attached bump stock and four 100-round magazines.Dhingra was also charged with making two false statements to acquire two firearms and for unlawfully possessing weapons as he was previously sent to a mental institution.Regular semi-automatic rifles require a person to pull the trigger every time they fire a shot.Bump stocks modifications allow the weapon to shoot repeatedly as a person holds his or her finger on the trigger. These stocks continuously "bump" back and forth as a person maintains forward pressure on the gun, allowing the weapon to fire at nearly the rate of a machine gun.According to the Southern District of Texas, if Dhingra is convicted of any of these charges, he faces up to 10 years of prison and possibly a US$250,000 fine.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  China's first clone cat signals that the countries gene research is developing, which, for one bereaved man, was great news. It's no secret that the internet loves cats, but how do we feel about cloning them?That was a no-brainer for 22-year-old businessman Huang Yu, as he was left heartbroken by the passing of his beloved British shorthair, "Garlic".  On remembering an article he had read on dog cloning in China, Mr. Huang dug up his pet shortly after burying it and stored it in the refrigerator.Mr. Huang told The New York Times, "In my heart, Garlic is irreplaceable." He said cloning was his only choice as his cat didn't leave anything for future generations. Seven months and $35,000 dollars later on July 21st, Beijing based company Sinogene produced China's first-ever cloned cat, Garlic 2. Cloned Garlic is scheduled to stay at Sinogene's lab for another month for observation before he is sent to Mr. Huang, who has said he hopes his new cat mirrors his previous one.Citing Gouminwang, The New York Times reports that China has 55 million pet dogs and 44 million pet cats, which, for a potentially lucrative cloning business, is a lot of future customers, despite critics claiming it is inefficient and inhumane.The New York Times states that many Chinese people do not think that using animals for medical research, even cosmetics testing is cruel, or even how pet cloning is potentially problematic.Most importantly, there are no laws against animal cruelty in China.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[OCOTLAN, MEXICO  A high school teacher has been suspended for his innovative way of getting his high school students to stop cheating during examshe put cardboard boxes over their heads.  The Excelsior reported that teacher Luis Juarez Texis came up with the bright idea for his Ethics and Values class at the Bachilleres 01 El Sabinal School in Ocotlán.  Apparently, the students had all consented to the exercise before the test. Each box had two holes for the students to look out of, but their peripheral vision was totally blocked. Unfortunately, after a photo of the boxes in action went viral over social media, some parents got hopping mad, calling the cardboard humiliating and violent. Violent?After the backlash from parents, the school released a statement explaining that is was a "dynamic exercise" to help "the students' psychomotor development." What the school should have just said is that your kids are cheating too much. Comments over social media run the gamut from complete shock and horror, to total approval of the teacher's methods. It's unclear if the box incident is being investigated any further. Hey, sometimes in order to think out of the box, you have to get into the box.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[XINJIANG, CHINA  A new report has uncovered mass digital surveillance of Uyghurs, a Muslim minority ethnic group in China.A report by Volexity has found that hackers affiliated with the Chinese government are carrying out cyber attacks on Uyghurs by targeting the websites they visit. It identified at least 11 websites related to Uyghurs and East Turkestan that had been jeopardized and used for surveillance.These websites are blocked in China and may be used to surveil the Uyghur diaspora outside of China, according to Volexity. These contain malicious code that installs spyware on users' phones when they visit the sites.The hackers were also observed targeting personal Gmail accounts by tricking users  into authorizing access, thereby gaining access to the user's emails.The report confirmed that the malware targeted Android users but said that these same tactics could be used against Apple and Microsoft phone users.Research by Google's Project Zero, which uncovered a hacking operation that targets iPhone users that visit certain websites, found that the operation was aimed at the Muslim Uyghurs and non-Uyghurs, TechCrunch reports, citing sources familiar with the matter.Google did not name the websites or who the hackers targeted. A spokesperson from Google told TechCrunch they would not comment beyond Project Zero's published research. A source familiar with Google's research confirmed to CNN that some of the websites that Volexity found coincided with some of the website that Project Zero found. This led some to question why Google would publish research against its competitor but fail to disclose the same about its Android devices.Project Zero leader Tim Willis denied all this on Twitter and said that Google had found the vulnerabilities in January, while Volexity had found vulnerabilities in Android devices later in the year.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH  Scientists have created a new breathalyzer that may one day aid in enforcing DUI laws.According to NPR, police currently do not have a device that can be used in the field to determine if a driver is under the influence of marijuana.Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh are working on a solution, developing a breathalyzer that can detect tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana.Current marijuana testing methods cannot be done in the field, since they rely on blood, urine, or hair samples. These tests also only reveal that the individual recently inhaled the drug, not that they are currently under the influence.The breathalyzer looks similar to those used for alcohol, with plastic casing, a protruding mouthpiece, and digital display.It works by using carbon nanotubes 100,000 times smaller than human hair. THC in the breath bind to tubes, causing a change in their electrical properties that can then be measured.During lab tests, the device successfully detected THC in a breath sample that also contained carbon dioxide, water, ethanol, methanol, and acetone.According to a university press release, researchers are planning to continue testing the prototype with the hope that it will move on to manufacturing. NPR reports that one thing that may be an issue is correlating the breathalyzer's output to the driver's level of impairment. With alcohol, a blood to breath ratio is used to determine drunkenness. But there isn't currently a ratio that links the level of THC in someone's breath to the amount in the blood, and then to exactly how impaired a person is.Still, researchers say creating the device is at least one step toward making sure folks don't drive stoned.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LIVERPOOL, UNITED KINGDOM  A woman who had a slight case of road rage now has a serious case of embarrassment after she was caught on video flipping out while her car had some ideas of its own. According to the Liverpool Echo, truck driver Scott Mccready was out driving his truck with a friend last Friday when they had a bit of a run in with a road rager. According to Mccready, the woman apparently got heated when he turned his truck onto a smaller side road. Video shows the woman driving a black Vauxhall drive onto the sidewalk in order to pass the truck. She then stops in the middle of the street and then gets out to come back and yell at Mccready.He hilariously interrupts her by saying, "put your handbrake on love."The road ragers turns around to see her car rolling down the street, so she runs after it and finally puts it in park. She then comes back to yell at Mccready, but by that time, the joke was already clearly on her. Luckily, no one was hurt in the bone headed incident. Well, the woman's ego definitely took a hit or two. Remember people, if you're going to road rage, at least road rage responsibly.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[THE FRIENDLY SKIES  A photo of a man standing on a plane while his supposed wife or partner is passed out across three airplane seats has Twitter all twisted up. A tweet shared last Thursday by life coach Courtney Lee Johnson from Indiana claims the unidentified gentleman stood in the aisle for a full six hours on a long-haul flight while the woman slept. Johnson was obviously impressed, adding the caption "this guy stood up for the whole 6 hours so his wife could sleep. Now THAT is love." Cue the Twitter outrage in 3...2...1. Johnson's tweet went viral with over 15,000 likes, over 3,300 retweets and over 2,400 comments.Many screamed fake news, questioning the genuineness of the image. Others debated whether or not the flight attendant would have allowed someone to chill in the aisle for an entire flight.Some Twitter users felt it was worth their time to hammer the woman for being an all around bad human being. One commenter hilariously pointed out how the man wasn't wearing a wedding ring, while another joked that the guy was standing the whole six hours planning his divorce. What do you think folks? Is this love at first flight? Or are they on a crash course to splitsville?]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WILSON, NORTH CAROLINA  After receiving a $70 dollar bill for some pay-per-view blue, 58-year-old Thomas Barnes said his Bichon Frise, Marino, was to blame.According to Mr. Barnes, his dog accidentally jumped up onto his bed and stepped on the remote.  Marino the dog had ordered pay-per-view from Hustler. Indignant Barnes told North Carolina's The News Observer, that he called the satellite TV company "within minutes", explaining the mishap and received assurances that all would be taken care of.However, to his alarm, access to the channel stayed on, so he called up again and received the very same promise, it would be taken care of. Unfortunately, when his bill came, they charged him anyway for the pay-per-view. So, Barnes paid his cable bill, minus the Hustler channel charge, but as a result, had his service cut off. Disabled Mr. Barnes, who depends on Social Security disability payments, said that charging $70 dollars was like taking food out of his mouth.After filing a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission, he got a call from DirectTV saying they would put credit on his next bill. However, Mr. Barnes still feels he is hard done by, saying, "there's a problem when there's a mistake and you expect me to pay for the mistake."]]></videoDesc>

The ship was carrying 4,000 vehicles and 24 crew members.According to the BBC, the Coast Guard had only managed to save 20 of the crew before a fire onboard forced them back.On Monday, rescuers drilled a hole in the hull of the ship to get food and water to three of the four South Korean crew members trapped near the propeller shaft, before later extracting them.The fourth man had been trapped behind glass in an engineering control room but was successfully pulled from the vessel to safety later in the day.In a tweet, the Coast Guard's Seventh District said operations will now focus on environmental protection, removing the ship, and resuming commerce.The Washington Post reports that two investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board will be reviewing the circumstances that led to the ship capsizing.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  As the African swine fever epidemic has already wiped out one third of the pig population in China, the Chinese government is releasing frozen pork from its emergency pork reserves to keep prices down.The disease is typically spread through bites by infectious ticks, contact through infected animals, contact with objects containing the virus, or by ingesting the meat of infected animals, according to the European Food Safety Authority.African swine fever is spread by the DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family, according to the World Organization for Animal Health.The World Organisation for Animal Health states that symptoms of the disease include high fever, redness on the ears, abdomen, and legs, as well as diarrhea.Farmers are wary of raising live pigs due to the large number of deaths of pigs caused by African swine fever.To increase the hog population, China's central government has instructed local governments to provide subsidies to larger pig farms to encourage them to raise more pigs.Some local governments have taken to issuing ration coupons and discounts to counterbalance the rising pork prices.China's entire frozen pork reserve is around 990,000 tonnes, the South China Morning Post reports, citing an analyst at China Merchant Securities.If China's pork supply is not enough to meet demand, the country would need to start importing from pig farms in European markets.China's meat reserve was created in 1996 to help stabilize meat prices during an emergency, according to the South China Morning Post.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  The premiere Apple event that fewer and fewer people look forward to every year is here once again. Fanboys across the world who were lucky enough to get invites to the Apple fall product launch were treated to an exclusive for your eyes only event. Unless you have internet. In that case, it's available online. Apple released its three new iPhones for 2019. This year's lineup includes the iPhone Expensive, the iPhone Overpriced and the iPhone Really Overpriced Pro.  Sure they look pretty much like identical twins from last year's phones, but there were some new bells and whistles. What good is a phone today if it doesn't come with amazing camera options? In addition to the existing telephoto and wide-angle lenses, some models now have a new ultra wide-angle lens for that perfect selfie. The new iPhone screens are apparently tougher to crack due to new shatter-resistance technology as well as better water resistance. Apple also debuted a bunch of other completely brand new same old same old products.Hey, and if you were smart enough to get the Apple Credit Card, now you have some shiny new overpriced stuff to charge.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SILICON VALLEY, CALIFORNIA  Private tech companies in Silicon Valley punishing and rewarding the behavior of their clients in a manner similar to China's social credit system, as detailed in a report by business magazine Fast Company.Life insurance companies can now base premiums off of a person's social media posts to gauge if a client might indulge in risky activities such as adventurous climbing.A company called PatronScan uses an ID scanner to help bars and restaurants handle customers and keep banned customers out. The company has a Banned Patrons list that keeps track of customers who are not welcome if they were previously removed for "fighting, sexual assault, drugs, theft and other bad behavior," according to PatronScan's website.Airbnb can ban customers for life for any reason it chooses. A message on the company's website notes that it is "not obligated" to explain why action is taken against an account. Uber has a similar policy in which passengers can get banned from using the service if their rating is "significantly below average."Messaging apps like WhatsApp are also now banning users if they send spam or threatening messages to others. A user's account can be terminated if they have been blocked by too many other users.This all is eerily reminiscent of China's social credit system, which has been in place since 2014.Under China's authoritarian government, citizens are assigned "personal trustworthiness points" as a way of monitoring the public and businesses. Trustworthy individuals are given more access to society while individuals who are blacklisted are severely restricted.These lists are publicly available on a Chinese government website called "Credit China."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA  Apple issued a strongly worded statement on September 6 calling into question Google's recently published research about a widespread hacking operation targeting iPhones.In a news release, Apple said Google's findings created a "false impression" about the attacks. The tech company said the hackings were "narrowly focused" and affected fewer than a dozen websites that provide content related to the Muslim Uyghurs in China.Google's Project Zero had uncovered a hacking operation in which websites would install a monitoring implant to steal sensitive data from iPhones if users simply visit the site. Google did not name the infected websites or the target of the attacks.According to the BBC, Apple believes Google did not mention who the hackers were targeting because of its business interests in China.Google also failed to mention that Android phones were also targeted in the hacking scandal. The company insists it did not know that its phones were affected and said that they only found exploits in iOS devices.A separate report by Volexity, which examined the same threat as Google, found that hackers affiliated with the Chinese government were carrying out cyber attacks on Uyghurs by targeting the websites they visit. These targeted iPhones as well as Android devices.Apple claims that the attacks took place for only two months, refuting Google's claims that the attacks were over a two-year period.In the news release, Apple goes on to say that it was already in the process of fixing the exploited bugs in the iPhones when Google approached the company. Apple says it fixed the vulnerabilities 10 days after it found out about the issue.Project Zero found a total of 14 different vulnerabilities across different iPhone operating systems from iOS10 to iOS12.In a statement to the Verge, Google said it stands by its report, adding that it will "continue to work with Apple and other leading companies to help keep people safe online."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  A face-swapping app that allows users to become their favorite celebrities is blowing up in China.The app is called Zao and it allows users to submit a selfie of their choice after which the app superimposes their face onto film stars like Leonardo DiCaprio or onto characters from TV shows such as Game of Thrones. The app transforms the user's face by blending their features with the celebrities' features and placing it into original film clips that are around five to 10 seconds in length.Just two days after the app was released, netizens in China noticed that a clause in the app allowed it to keep user images and potentially sell them to third parties without any consent from the user.One user commented on Weibo: "Why is an app restricting us on our rights to our own selfies?"Another user commented saying that: "Don't you dare take my images and use them for anything! What a terrible app!"A third said: "The app is fun and interesting, but you should improve user security because it is really worrisome."The controversial clause has since been removed from the app's terms of service.Momo, the company behind Zao, released a statement saying the app will not store user images, and explained that users are not at risk of identity theft if they use the app.The company explained that they present a virtual image of a person and don't collect anyone's biometric data or features for facial recognition.Zao said it would allow users to delete images that were previous uploaded onto its platform.However, some users were quick to point out that Zao didn't mention what would happen to images that were previously stored on the app's server.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[KOTO, JAPAN  A part-time mall clerk in Japan was busted for stealing 1,300 credit card numbers and using them to make purchases online. Sure he broke the law, but how he did it was pretty damn impressive. According to Sora News, 34-year-old Yusuke Taniguchi was able to jack all those cards by using nothing but his photographic-like memory. According to police, while working at the mall, Taniguchi would allegedly memorize a customer's 16-digit-number, name, expiry date and security code, all in the short time it took to process their purchase. That ain't bad considering how quick credit card transactions are nowadays. After the customers left, he would write the credit card information down into a little notebook he kept. Taniguchi would then use those credit cards to make online purchases, which he would then sell to pawn shops for money. Unfortunately having a great memory didn't help when it came to criminal planning. Taniguchi had everything he bought online sent to his home address. After he bought two expensive bags online for around $2,500, the cops became fishy and followed the delivery to Taniguchi's doorstep and later arrested him.    Guess next time he just needs to remember not to use his OWN address.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C.  Nearly every U.S. state is jumping in on a new antitrust probe targeting search giant Google.The Associated Press reports that the attorney generals of 50 states and territories, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have announced an investigation into Google's "potentially monopolistic behavior."California, where the company is based, and Alabama, are not participating.The probe will focus on the tech giant's dominance in advertising and search. According to eMarketer, Google holds more than 37% of the digital advertising market in the U.S., and 75% of the search advertising market.But the attorneys general have also hinted that the investigation could extend to other businesses and services owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, such as Youtube or the Android operating system.CNN Business reports that on Monday, states sent Google a civil investigative demand or CID, which is a compulsory request for information.South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg told the news outlet that the document contains many questions and is dozens of pages long.The multi-state investigation is the second to be announced in a week, after eight states and the District of Columbia said they've started a probe into Facebook.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA  Google has filed a patent to use artificial intelligence to monitor babies.The company could use an HD video monitor and its A.I. engines to detect if a baby is feeling uncomfortable, CNBC reports, citing the newly published patent application.The A.I. engines could use position detection to determine whether a baby is standing, kneeling, laying down, crawling or climbing.The patent says that if the baby is continually tossing or turning, the baby may be feeling some sort of discomfort such as feeling too hot or cold. The A.I. could automatically alert the baby's caregiver if he or she is facing any sort of discomfort.The technology may also use an "eye state analysis" to check the babies' pupils to determine if the baby is awake or asleep.The patent may be an expansion of Google's Nest security camera, according to Digital Trends.Google has yet to make any public announcements about its futuristic baby monitors.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SPACE  Scientists have found water for the first time on a potentially habitable exoplanet.According to the Washington Post, exoplanet K2-18b is twice as big as Earth, with eight times its mass. It orbits a red dwarf star 110 light years or 650 million miles away from Earth, completing an orbit every 33 days.K2-18b sits in its star's habitable zone. The BBC reports that this gives it a temperature of between zero and 40 degrees Celsius, cool enough to have liquid water.Using data collected by the hubble space telescope, scientists studied looked for subtle changes in starlight as it filtered through K2-18b's atmosphere.According to CNN, they detected the molecular signature for water vapor in the planet's atmosphere, along with the signatures for hydrogen and helium.The BBC reports that computer modelling of the data suggests as much as 50 percent of the planet's atmosphere could be composed of water.According to CNN, researchers say other elements like nitrogen or hydrogen could be present in the planet's atmosphere, but can only be revealed by more advanced future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope or ESA's Ariel mission.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CHENGDU, CHINA  Two Chinese women were caught on camera riding bikes during a Chengdu women's half marathon and have now been banned for life from the competition. The two Chinese Forest Gumpswhich go by the names Yang and Songclearly have a lifelong passion for the sport of running.    Apparently training for marathons and half marathons in China involves bicycles, particularly ones that can be found along the race routes. According to Shine News, Yang and Song were absolutely killing it at the half-marathon on September 8 until some snitches snapped photos of the two on ride sharing bikes during the race.It's unclear what their finishing times were, but at least Thing One and Thing Two can hold their heads up high knowing they gave it their all.Good thing it wasn't a full marathon, Yang and Song probably would have hopped in a car or taken the bus to finish the race. Their results were thrown out, and they will be banned from participating again.  The Chinese Athletics Association has also been notified and may further punish the two outstanding runners. As running has supposedly gained popularity in China, so has rampant cheating in marathons.]]></videoDesc>

Enter the makeup artist who Patel met at a hotel room in Delhi where his beard and hair were dyed white. According to NDTV, he was given thick glasses, a turban and a white tunic and a wheelchair to top it all off. According to CNN, at around 10:45 p.m. on September 8, Patel went to the Indira Gandhi International Airport to try and board an overnight flight to New York.He actually made it past the initial security check and got his immigration cleared. Then Patel's plan hit some turbulence after airport authorities started to notice things like his white beard having black roots, or the fact the his skin didn't look old or have any wrinkles. Upon further questioning from Central Industrial Security Force officials, he cracked and admitted he was 32-year-old Jayesh Patel. He was detained by security for holding a fake passport and handed over to immigration. A senior CISF official told CNN she was unaware of the current status of the case.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[Earth  If you're an avid stargazer, then you'll know all about this Friday's majestic micro harvest moon, if you don't, then watch closely. A micro harvest moon will be visible on Friday the 13, when the moon reaches its apogee. The moon's orbit is an elliptical one, which, from the eyes of an observer on earth, causes variations to the moon's size. The closest point of the moon's orbit to earth is known as the perigee. The farthest is known as the apogee.Lunar phases shift as the moon changes its position relative to the sun and earth. A full moon appears when it is in direct opposition to the sun and is completely illuminated as seen from earth.A "supermoon" occurs when a full moon takes place while it is closest to earth. A "micro moon" occurs when a full moon appears while it is at its farthest point from earth. According to Norwegian site Time and Date, because a micro moon is further away, it appears approximately 14 percent smaller than a supermoon. The illuminated area also appears around 30 percent smaller, resulting in a less bright surface.Old folklore tales suggest that micro moons affect human mental health and bring on natural disasters, which of course is not backed by science, even if this micro harvest moon is coming on Friday the 13th.You can see this year's spectacle by looking to the east at moonrise on Friday or by looking to the west at moonset early on Saturday morning.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MONTOURSVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA  A couple is now staring down felony theft charges after the bank accidentally dropped $120,000 in their account, which then led them to go on an insane spending spree.  According to CNN, the banking error occurred on May 31 when a customer in Georgia made a $120,000 deposit, and the BB&T Bank teller punched in the wrong account number. After the Williams discovered the extra money in their account, they did what any responsible person would do. They blew all of it. CNN reports the affidavit said Tiffany Wiilliams told police the money was spent on an SUV, a camper, two four wheelers, a trailer and a race car. According to Local 10, they also used the money to pay bills and gave $15,000 to some friends in need of some money. When the bank realized their mistake they contacted the couple by phone. Tiffany told the bank on June 21 that they'd gone through all the cash, but would come up with a repayment plan. That clearly didn't happen, because now the two are facing down a whole bunch of charges. Robert Williams told WNEP, "All I'm going to say is we took some bad legal advice from some people, and it probably wasn't the best thing in the end." And that is a lesson in why you don't ask your friends for legal advice.]]></videoDesc>

It can capture images and transfer them over to a police station in real time.The robot will eventually be integrated with 5G technology. This will allow people to directly communicate with police officers through the robot.The robot is able to surveil the streets 24 hours a day, the newspaper reports, citing the police. This isn't the first time China has dabbled with robot technology for its police.Earlier this year, the country had launched three different traffic robot police in Handan, Hebei province in northern China. These are the road patrol robot, the traffic advice robot, and the accident warning robot, according to the Global Times. The road patrol robot is essentially a traffic police officer, as it identifies and takes photos when drivers are breaking the rules. The advice traffic robot is present at vehicle management stations. It answers people's questions and guides them to the different counters.The accident warning robot roams the streets letting passing vehicles know that the police are dealing with a traffic accident.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[AMAZON BASIN, BRAZIL  Scientists have found a powerful new species of electric eel that can deliver electrical jolts greater than any other known animal.A new study published in Nature Communications details the discovery of two new electric eel species living in the Amazon basin.Electric eels are actually a type of knifefish with an eel-like appearance. They can grow to be around seven to eight feet long.The scientists involved in the study analyzed 107 samples of electric eels and found three species with separate genetic material and different skull shapes but similar external features.Previously, it was believed that the Amazon basin was home to a single species of electric eel.One of the newly discovered species, Electrophorus voltai, can discharge up to 860 volts of electricity  much more than the 650 volts generated by the previously known species Electrophorus electricus.Electrophorus varii, the other newly identified species, can produce up to 572 volts.Other kinds of fish can generate electric fields, which they use to navigate waters and to communicate. Only electric eels use their electricity for hunting and self-defense, according to a news release by the Smithsonian. Researchers believe Electrophorus voltai may have adapted to produce higher electrical power due to the poor conductivity of the highland waters where the species resides.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HONG KONG  Hong Kong police fired water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters, after alleged petrol bombs and rocks were thrown at government buildings on Sunday. According to the Guardian, tens of thousands of demonstrators defied a police ban and marched, calling for greater democracy in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The Guardian reports that hundreds of protesters splintered off from the march and surrounded the Chinese People's Army base in the Admiralty district. Reuters reports that some protesters threw bricks and molotov cocktails at police and took down. They also set fire to a red banner proclaiming the 70th anniversary on Oct. 1 of the founding of the People's Republic of China. According to the Guardian, this prompted riot police to fire multiple rounds of tear gas as well as a water cannon the covered demonstrators in blue dye, to help identify protesters in order to be arrested later. According to Reuters, the water cannon truck later caught fire after being hit by a petrol bomb. Reuters reports that protesters are upset about what they see as increasing interference from Beijing into the city's affairs. The spark for the protests was a planned extradition bill, which has now been scrapped, that would have allowed for people to be sent to China for trial. According to Reuters, the protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage. According to the Guardian, Sunday's clashes between police and protesters marks the 15th consecutive weekend of mass protests in Hong Kong.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[KILAUEA, HAWAII  New research has found that the eruption of Kilauea volcano last year caused an influx of lava into the North Pacific Ocean which in turn triggered a large algae bloom.Satellite images from NASA showed the water surrounding the Kilauea volcano starting to turn green soon after the volcanic eruption.Scientists collected water samples of the green algal bloom and found that it contained higher levels of nitrate, silicic acid, iron and phosphate, according to a news release from the University of Southern California.One of the researchers involved with the study explained that they did not expect an algae bloom as lava does not contain any nitrate.Nitrogen, which contains nitrate, is believed to have come up from the depths of the ocean as lava sank into deeper water, according to the study published in the journal Science.As the lava began heating up the deeper waters, the nutrients in the water also warmed up, becoming really buoyant and floating up to the surface, which then helped spur algal growth.  According to Hawaii Tribune-Herald, green algae is important as fish and other marine creatures in the sea are dependent on it for nutrients.The authors of the study suggested that it is possible this mechanism has led to similar ocean fertilization events in the past associated with the formation of the Hawaiian Islands and other major volcanic eruptions.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SAUDI ARABIA  Iran has dismissed accusations from the United States that it was behind the recent attacks on Saudi energy facilities.Reuters reports that two Saudi Arabia oil facilities run by state-owned company Aramco were set ablaze following drone strikes early Saturday morning.The attack cut more than half of the country's oil output, or roughly five percent of the global oil supply.The BBC reports that Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they deployed 10 drones to strike the Abqaiq oil processing plant and Khurais oil field.Riyadh has said Iran arms the Houthis, a charge both parties deny, according to Reuters.The New York Times reports that satellite images released by the U.S. government show at least 17 points of impact to key infrastructure at the two sites.A senior administration official told CNN the strikes appeared to have come from the north or northwest, which is consistent with an attack from Iraq or Iran, rather than Yemen.The possible use of cruise missiles with the drones also indicate a level of scope, precision, and sophistication the Houthis alone could not have been capable of.In a tweet on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump said "there is reason to believe we know the culprit" and that the U.S. is "locked and loaded" to respond, pending verification from the Kingdom. Both Iraq and Iran have denied involvement, according to DW. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi has called the allegations from the U.S. "pointless," dismissing them as "maximum lies."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SUZHOU, CHINA  A puppy in eastern China has become quite the viral sensation for being a stickler when it comes to traffic safety rules. CCTV footage released by Suzhou traffic police from September 7 shows a jaywalker carelessly start to walk diagonally across an intersection. At the same time, a small white puppy can be seen approaching the intersection from across the street.The jaywalker, surnamed Wang, only makes it a few steps before a small compact car drives up and gives Wang a little love tap, sending him head over heels.After watching that whole scene unfold, our four-legged little friend makes his way over to the crosswalk. The puppy clearly knows that Chinese streets are no joke, so he takes a second to look both ways, letting a few people with scooters scoot by. The little pooch then uses the crosswalk to safely cross the street in one piece.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SPACE  Astronomers have spotted a comet heading our way    will be the second interstellar object to ever be detected visiting our solar system.According to NASA's jet propulsion laboratory, comet C/2019 Q4 was first spotted by Ukrainian amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov on August 30.It is 20 kilometers wide and bright, unlike the small and faint Oumuamua, an interstellar object that passed through our solar system in 2017.The comet is currently 420 million kilometers from the Sun. It will reach its closest point on Dec. 8, 2019, at a distance of about 300 million kilometers.C/2019 Q4 appears to follow a hyperbolic trajectory and has a current velocity of 150,000 kilometers per hour. These both indicate that the comet is likely interstellar in nature  originating from beyond our solar system.Its high velocity also means it will later leave and head back to interstellar space.Unlike Oumuamua, C/2019 Q4 is an active comet. National Geographic reports that astronomers have detected its coma, the fuzzy envelope of dust and gas that forms around a comet's nucleus.According to NASA, the interstellar comet can be seen with professional telescopes in the coming months, peaking in brightness in mid-December. It will be observable with moderate-size telescopes until April 2020, but after that and through October 2020, it can only be seen with larger professional telescopes.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  A joint study from the University of California Los Angeles and Stanford University demonstrates a way to generate electricity in the dark by use of a thermoelectric generator device.In the study published in the journal Joule, researchers explain that the device consists of a black aluminum disk on the surface with a small thermoelectric generator placed at the bottom part. The device' surface gives off thermal radiation to the atmosphere at night, allowing its surface to become a cooler temperature than the surrounding air in a process known as radiative cooling.As heat is released unevenly, the bottom part of the device, which contains the generator, still has heat. The excess heat is converted into electricity.In the paper, lead author of the study, Aaswath Raman, from UCLA's Department of Material Science and Engineering, explains that the device generated up to 25 millawatts of electricity per square meter, which was enough to power a white LED.In comparison, the New York Times pointed out that a photovoltaic solar panel is able to harness around 200 watts per square meter when it is under direct sunlight.This means that a solar panel is able to produce approximately 8,000 times more energy than the thermoelectric generator.In a news release from UCLA, Raman explained that the device could potentially harness as much as 0.5 watts per square meter in hot and dry climates where radiative cooling has a stronger effect.The team added that they believed that technology can complement existing solar technology as it is able to work during the night.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NORTH CAMBRIDGESHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM  Two British skydivers almost went splat all over the cockpits of two U.S. fighter jets that were traveling at a mere 350 mph. According to a report released by the UK Airprox Board, the two skydivers were jumping over Chatteris Airfield, about 90 miles north of London, on April 17. According to the BBC, the pair were in freefall, traveling at around 120 mph straight down when they noticed two fighter jets speeding their way. The report stated that "once the parachutists had seen the F15s there was very little they could do to avoid the situation, having no control over their speed or direction whilst in free-fall." The two American F-15s flew directly under the skydivers traveling around 350 miles per hour. According to NBC News, the F-15 pilots never saw the skydivers, but even if they had, there would have been almost no time to avoid the collision. The planes were so close, Go-Pro footage from one of the skydiver's helmets clearly shows the F-15s passing right beneath them. NBC News reports the fighter jets were based out of Royal Air Force Lakenheath, which is host to the U.S. Air Force's 48th Fighter Wing. Thanks to some good old miscommunication, the pilots had not been warned about skydivers in the area. According to 48th Fighter Wing Commander Col Will Marshall, UK airspace is "incredibly complex and often congested." He also added, "we are using this incident to reinforce the vital importance of situational awareness and attention to detail for all of our air traffic controllers and aircrew."]]></videoDesc>

Popular Instagram account Passenger Shaming posted a snap of an unidentified guy who took his quest for inflight shut-eye on a whole 'nother level. Literally  by relocating to the floor under his seat for a snooze.There's really not enough bleach in the universe to cleanse that man of all the nasties lurking on that plane carpet. Toe jam, puke bits, even pee  if it's vile, you can bet it's on the floor.Needless to say, folks were equal parts grossed out, morbidly curious, and kind of impressed. How DID the dude manage to tuck himself under there without getting flagged by a flight attendant? Even more importantly, how did he get out during the stampede that is disembarking a plane? Is the dude awake, is he even alive?!As of Monday night, 40 winks' photo has gotten nearly 10,000 likes, and been thoroughly Insta-shamed.Still, Rip Van Winkle isn't the worst plane offender we've seen this century. Nothing brings out bad behavior, icky feet, and bodily fluids quite like a couple of hours in cattle class.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SPACE  Both Israel and India failed to successfully land lunar probes on the moon earlier this year because of a chain of malfunctions that occurred during the final stages of descent.Israel's Beresheet lander crashed during a landing attempt on April 11. India's Vikram moon lander, which was part of the country's Chandrayaan-2 mission, crashed while attempting to land on September 6.The Beresheet lander crashed due to a malfunction that caused its main engine to shut down, according to Space.com The Beresheet team lost connection with the lunar lander when it was around 150 meters away from the moon's surface. At the time, the lander was traveling at speeds of up to 500 kilometers per hour.Though the team successfully restarted the spacecraft's engine before it crashed, it was unable to control the lunar probe's landing as the lander was traveling too fast and was too close to the moon's surface. The Vikram Lander had diverged from its original path when it reached an altitude of 2.1 kilometers, the New York Times reports. Shortly after, communication between the lander and the Indian spacecraft operators stopped.One of the reasons the last stage of a moon landing is challenging is because the lunar lander has to carry out a series of complex tasks in a matter of minutes for the lunar probe to land successfully, reports Business Insider. As the lander approaches the moon's surface, it has to adjust to the moon's uneven gravitational pull, which is stronger in some regions than others. Scientists believe this may be due to the fact that some areas of the moon have a higher concentration of mass underneath the surface.The lander also has to watch out for the moon's rocky terrain and moon dust, also called regolith, which could interfere with spacecraft equipment as the lander makes its descent.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[JACOBINA, BRAZIL  Researchers from Yale University have found that an experiment to release transgenic mosquitoes in Brazil as a way to reduce the mosquito population has backfired.Millions of genetically modified male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were released over more than two years in Jacobina, Brazil, according to a Yale University news release. The mosquito strain carried a dominant lethal gene that meant to render them unable to produce viable offspring with wild female mosquitoes.According to the Yale news release, the experiment was aimed at lowering the local mosquito population to reduce the public's risk of contracting diseases such as Zika, dengue, and yellow fever.In a study published in Scientific Reports, gene samples of both the transgenic and wild mosquitoes were analyzed before and after the release of the modified males.Researchers found that some of the wild species retained genes from the transgenic strain, despite initial claims that the genes would not enter the general population, as any offspring was expected to die.The mosquito population initially declined after the transgenic mosquitoes were released into the wild, but increased again after about 18 months, according to the news release. Researchers say the local population is now likely more resilient since the population has mixed with strains from Cuba and Mexico that were crossed together to create genetically modified males.Senior author of the study, Jeffrey Powell hypothesized that population may have bounced back after local female mosquitoes learned and started avoiding mating with the modified males.Powell said in the news release that the mixed mosquitoes pose no known health risks.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  When the massive dino-killing asteroid slammed into the planet millions of years ago, it ended the Mesozoic Era and wiped out nearly 75 percent of all life. Now, a drilling expedition at the impact site has revealed new details of this world-changing event. A new study led by the University of Texas at Austin analyzed core samples from the Chicxulub crater in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. The team used it to assemble a timeline of what happened after the dinosaur-killing asteroid crashed into Earth.According to a university news release, one of the most notable finds is that roughly 425 feet of material was deposited into the crater in just one day, making it one of the highest rates ever encountered in the geological record.Researchers estimate that the asteroid struck a shallow ocean some 66 million years ago, hitting it with the force of 10 billion atomic bombs. The blast set the land ablaze, igniting trees and plants up to thousands of miles away.The impact then triggered a massive tsunami several hundred meters high and moving away from the crater.According to the New York Times, it also catapulted rock into the upper atmosphere.Lead author of the study, Sean Gulick, said the largest debris pieces fell back down to Earth in minutes. Smaller particles lingered longer and fell across North America as tektites  glassy orbs that form when molten rock cools while falling.Charcoal fragments and chemical biomarkers of soil fungi found above sand layers inside the sample indicate that charred remains on land were pulled back into the crater by the receding tsunami waters.Perhaps the most important discovery made during the study is the absence of sulfur in the core, even though the area around the impact crater is full of sulfur-rich rocks.This supports the theory that the asteroid impact vaporized sulfur-bearing rocks at the site, releasing the mineral into the atmosphere, where it reflected sunlight away from the planet and caused global cooling.According to researchers, 325 million metric tons of sulfur is estimated to have been released by the impact. That's about 10,000 times greater than the sulfur spewed by the Krakatoa eruption in 1883, which cooled the Earth by an average of 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit for five years.Although the asteroid caused destruction at the regional level when it hit, the impact itself was not what killed off the dinosaurs.Instead, researchers say the global climate change that followed was responsible for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. Global cooling disrupted photosynthesis, which killed the plants and caused the food chain to collapse.The nightmarish sequence of events detailed in the study are what scientists have long hypothesized to have happened. Only this time, there's evidence to back it up  and set in stone, no less.The New York Times reports that early this year, another study found fossils of fish, trees, terrestrial vertebrates, and marine creatures near an ancient lake in North Dakota. Shock waves from the asteroid are believed to have flung them on shore, where they died buried in mud.As more of the crater core samples are studied and analyzed, many more details will no doubt be revealed about Earth's most destructive day.]]></videoDesc>

The footage from Tuesday captures the luminous and towering twister rip it up across a meadow on the banks of a motorway in Santa Helena de Goiás.In the video, trucks that have pulled up to spectate are dwarfed by the wild tornado of fire, also known as the 'fire devil' making for some pretty unnerving scenes.The raging rarity arcs upwards with fiery explosions from its base. That fire was eventually contained by the farmers, however, not everything ended there.According to the Peruvian newspaper, La República, two days later a second firenado was captured wreaking havoc in a cane plantation.Experts from Sao Paulo's Somar Meteorology Institute report that fire tornadoes are one of the "rarest events in nature" and that they only materialize with a combination of high temperatures, turbulent winds, low air humidity, and dry soil. Brazilian firefighters say that these relentless swirls can reach up to 80 meters high.However, mechanical engineer Jason Forthofer, told National Geographic that he believes some fire tornados can grow more than a thousand feet tall.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SAUDI ARABIA  Investigators in Saudi Arabia and the U.S. say there's a "very high probability" that the Saudi oil attack originated from Iran. Reuters reports that the Abqaiq oil processing plant and Khurais oil field both run by state-owned company Aramco were set ablaze following drone strikes.The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning, cut more than half of the country's oil output, or roughly five percent of the global oil supply.The New York Times reports that satellite images released by the U.S. government show at least 17 points of impact at key infrastructure at the two sites.Yemen's Houthi rebels had claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the BBC, saying they deployed 10 drones to strike the two oil facilities.But a source told CNN that U.S. and Saudi investigators have determined that the attack was launched from a base in Iran, close to its border with Iraq. A mix of drones and cruise missiles carried out the strike, flying at a low altitude over southern Iraq and through Kuwait before reaching their targets.According to CNN's source, the route would have allowed the missiles to avoid passing over U.S. and Saudi radar and air defense systems, which are strongest in the Persian Gulf.Another source said that images showing the wreckage of a failed missile in the desert appear to be of a Quds 1. While this missile is used by the Houthis, it does not have a range that would allow it to hit from Yemen, 1,300 kilometers away.The Quds 1, however, is based on an Iranian design, similar to the Iranian cruise missiles Soumar and Hoveyzeh, which are capable of traversing such a long range.Both the U.S. and Saudi have gone on record to say the projectiles didn't come from Yemeni territory. According to the New York Times, a military spokesman from the Kingdom also said the weapons were Iranian-made. Still, solid, irrefutable evidence that Iran was behind the attack has yet to come to light.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  Researchers in London have identified a new species of salamander that may be the largest amphibian alive today.Scientists used DNA taken from museum specimens collected in the early 20th century to identify two new salamander species from three river systems and mountain ranges in China.The Chinese giant salamanders were previously considered to be part of a single species known as Andrias davidianus.Scientists compared tissue samples from wild salamanders with historical specimens in the Natural History Museum London and discovered that the salamanders contained three distinct genetic lineages, according to a new study from the journal Ecology and Evolution. Lead author of the study Samuel Turveyl from the Institute of Zoology explained in a news release that the salamanders may have evolved between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago due to mountain formation in China and the rise of the Tibetan Plateau.One of the newly identified salamander species, Andria sligoi, had its characteristics defined by a preserved salamander specimen in the British history museum. The other newly discovered species has yet to be named or described and is only known from its tissue samples.The authors of the study suggest that the Andrias sligoi is the world's largest amphibian species as it can grow to be around two meters in length.Andrias davidianus, the previously known salamander species, is able to grow to be around one meter in length.]]></videoDesc>

NBC News was the first to highlight that Secret Service agents had been using their own personal funds to rent jet skis in order to be closer to the first family during watersport activities. The Secret Service said it needed 4-stroke, 4-cylinder 1498cc watercraft capable of carrying a maximum weight of 900 pounds. According to NBC Washington, models meeting that criteria start at around $10,000 each.According to NBC News, the jet skis will be stored at the Secret Service's training center in Beltsville, Maryland.]]></videoDesc>

Citing local media, MSN reports that 35-year-old Claudia Ochoa Felix had visited a nightclub with a man.The pair slept late, and when the man tried to wake her in the morning, she did not respond  prompting him to call the authorities.According to El Universal, the State Attorneys General said that she died of pulmonary aspiration during the night.According to Medline Plus, pulmonary aspiration occurs when someone inhales foreign objects such as fluids into their lungs.Prosecutors said that alcohol and other substances were found in Ochoa Felix's body, however, they are waiting for the autopsy results to learn more.The Telegraph reported on Ochoa Felix back in 2014, when she became social media-famous for posting photos of herself wielding gold and pink AK-47s and sporting designer handbags.She denied her involvement with any criminal organization, branding the claims as, "cowardly lies and slander".]]></videoDesc>

Whatever happens with the Storm Area 51 event, UFO hunters will at least be pleased to know that the U.S. Navy has acknowledged that UFOs do exist. Bloomberg reports that military pilots in recent years have been reporting more and more sightings of spherical flying objects, tic tac UFOs, or as everyone now prefers to call them: "unidentified aerial phenomena." According to Vice, former Blink 182 singer Tom DeLonge had posted three government videos of what he claimed were encounters between Navy jets and UAPs. The first one was footage of a floating oblong object that pilots recorded with their F-18 gun camera in 2004.The second, titled "Gimbal," was captured on January 2015 and shows an anomalous aerial object rotating as pilots try  and fail  to make sense of what they're seeing.The third clip, called "Go Fast," was captured on the same day as "Gimbal" and featured a fast-flying object zipping over the surface of the water.It's all pretty fascinating. But as the crazy UFO guy who founded his own UFO watchdog group, no one took DeLonge THAT seriously.Well, surprise, surprise, because the Navy just came out and confirmed that while the three videos were never actually cleared for public release, they are in fact real and authentic.At the risk of tinfoil hat wearers up and joining a spaceship cult, however, the Navy did go on to clarify that UAPs don't necessarily mean alien or extraterrestrial. So no, Carol, ET is probably not on his way to pick you up.For all we know, someone somewhere might just be testing out a top secret, super classified, state-of-the-art weapons systems... or something.We still think Tom DeLonge is a crazy UFO dude, but he wins this round.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HOUSTON   Authorities are on the lookout for a spooky Texas bank robber that's been nicknamed the "Mummy Marauder."Friday the 13th has long been considered the most unlucky date on the calendar, when cursed things seem to pop out  including one Houston criminal who had the bright idea to rob a bank in costume.According to an FBI release, the suspect, identified only as a 5 foot 11 black man in his early 20s, had wrapped white gauze around his face and body, before donning a wig, cap, and glasses.The Mummy Marauder then sauntered into a First Convenience Bank in Harris County, where he threatened a teller while demanding cash.He managed to get his hands on an undisclosed amount of money, and was last seen jumping into a black Mitsubishi Montero SUV.The FBI is now asking the public for any leads so they can nab the Mummy Marauder and keep him wrapped up behind bars.Crime Stoppers in Houston is also offering a $5,000 reward for any information that can lead to an arrest.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NEW YORK  As climate change brings with it the threat of increasingly violent storms, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and New York State plan to begin construction of a seawall in 2020 to fortify Staten Island's coastline.The South Shore Staten Island Coastal Storm Risk Management Project will consist of a seven-mile long seawall from Fort Wadsworth to Oakwood Beach, according to a statement from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.The project will include 4.5 miles of buried seawall which will be topped with an elevated multi-use promenade that can be used for recreational and outdoor activities."The Army Corp of Engineers stated on its website that this will protect the surrounding area from roughly 21.4 feet of seawater rise.In addition to the seawall, 0.35 miles of floodwalls and 0.6 miles of levees will also be built to protect against storm surge and floods.Tidal wetlands and ponding areas will be incorporated to absorb flood water more efficiently.Staten Island is taking steps to ensure its shorelines are well-protected to prevent damage from storms such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which wreaked havoc on the borough and took the lives of 24 of its residents, while causing an estimated $19 billion in damage to New York City.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SEATTLE  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a proposal to extend critical habitat for the Southern Resident killer whales to better protect the whales as their population continues to decline.The proposal calls for expanding the whales' critical habitat from the Seattle area, roughly 2,560 square miles, to coastal waters stretching from Cape Flattery, Washington to Point Sur, California, excluding an area off of Washington's coast for military activities.This would cover an additional area of 15,626 square miles between depths of 20 feet and 650 feet.The Southern Resident killer whales are genetically different from other killer whale populations and mainly consume salmon, while the others eat seals or other marine mammals.The NOAA cited research stating genetic samples show the whales swim as far north to Alaska's Taku River and as far south to the Central Valley in California for salmon.The proposal would be limited to federal agencies to ensure that any activities they pay for or carry out do not damage or destroy whale habitats. This includes making sure the waters contain sufficient prey and that water quality allows the whales to grow and develop, reproduce and migrate.NOAA's website states that killer whales are threatened by a lack of food due to overfishing, loss of habitat as well as contaminants such as pesticides that enter the ocean and accumulate in a whale's body.The Southern Resident killer whales are listed as an endangered species with only 76 individuals remaining, according to the NOAA.]]></videoDesc>

According the India Today, Shyam Lal Yadav said his bad ass horn started growing on top of his head after an injury several years back. India Today reports that over time, the horn got bigger and bigger. Yadav thought it was a bit strange, but then he just got used to it and even started trimming it by himself. Hey with all the time people spend doing their hair, might as well spend time fixing up the the old horn if you got one. Shyam finally had the growth removed at the Bhagyoday Tirth hospital in Sagar. According to India Today, surgeons from the hospital said Yadav suffers from a sebaceous horn condition which generally occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Previous cases of devil horns have been known to appear on the face, ears, hands, and toes.]]></videoDesc>

While using his back and legs to keep himself suspended in a gap only about 8 or 9 stories up, he nonchalantly holds his phone and chats away.

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[PHILADELPHIA  U.S.-based design firm Practice for Architecture and Urbanism and real estate company Brandywine Realty Trust have unveiled designs for a pair of towers in University City in West Philadelphia as part of the Schuylkill Yards development project.The project is aimed at transforming around seven million square feet of space into a neighborhood with residential and commercial buildings.The towers are jointly called the JFK Towers, with one of the buildings being referred to as the East Tower and the other the West Tower. The East Tower will be around 512 feet tall and consist of shifted building blocks with a red facade stacked on top of one another, according to a Practice for Architecture and Urbanism news release. The East Tower is aiming to achieve LEED Silver certification in which a project must earn 50 to 59 points on a sustainability checklist by the U.S. Green Building Council in order to be certified. The architectural firm did not detail which eco-friendly features the tower would include.The West Tower will be around 360 feet tall and consists of a rectangular building on top of a wider building. Its exterior will make use of neutral colors such as gray.The towers will offer retail, office and residential spaces.The JFK towers will be connected by the High Line Plaza, an open space on the ground floor where the public can gather for social activities.The architectural firm says the designers took inspiration from the city's old railcars and distinct red sandstone when designing the project.Construction on the towers is to begin in 2020.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The Washington Monument's notoriously faulty elevator strikes again!WTOP reports that the Washington Monument reopened last Thursday after three years of renovation. Everyone was excited...except for the moody celebrity that is the monument's elevator.Days later on Saturday, the lift, which takes visitors up to the observation deck 500 feet up, broke down at 1 p.m. and stayed that way for about an hour.Luckily, no one was inside the elevator when it malfunctioned. Imagine the horror!The Washington Post reports that while it wasn't immediately clear what caused the glitch, staff managed to get it back up and running  to the great relief of everyone who was still at the top.The National Mall NPS later tweeted an update saying everyone got back to the ground safely, and apologizing to anyone who was inconvenienced. Hey, at least folks didn't have to get evacuated.Ironically, the renovation was supposed to fix this same faulty elevator that broke down multiple times between 2014 and 2016. Visitors back then were often left stranded at the top, facing the very real possibility of walking down 897 steps.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[XICHANG, CHINA  It seems harder and harder nowadays to find good ways to use loose change, that is unless you live in China and enjoy the comforts of air travel. According to the Chengdu Business News, a superstitious 23-year-old woman surnamed Wang was thoughtful enough to bless her plane by tossing three coins at the aircraft while on the jetway.  Reports say the MONEY incident occurred at an airport in the Sichuan province city of Xichang on September 5, as Wang and some relatives were flying to a family wedding.  At first, no one noticed the preflight coin toss. It wasn't until airport workers later found three coins on the ground during a security check and notified police. According to the SCMP, after authorities examined the surveillance footage, they identified Wang as the culprit. Wang told police one of her cousins had a kid with a bit of an issue with the runs, so she thought by hurling coins at the plane it would help with a safe journey. She also made it a point to tell authorities she didn't know coin tossing was a massive no-no.On a side noteWang is also trying to get into medical school.At this point it kind of seems like a preflight ritual, as China has been blessed with up to at least eight of these lucky coin incidents over the past few years.]]></videoDesc>

Often times the higher traffic restrooms are even less likely to provide T.P., which can leave your backside in a bit of a pickle.And the bathrooms that do offer toilet paper also have their own unique problems, like this one in Yibin, Chinapeople jacking all the free toilet paper.Thanks to surveillance footage, workers were finally able to figure out why the dispenser was always empty. Video posted to Miaopai apparently shows people in the building showing up around 5 a.m. to clear the toilet paper out. The footage shows two different women and one man pull off separate TP heists, clearing the dispenser out.    One unlucky man then walks up to find him and his bowels are out of luckOH CRAP.  Maybe instead of installing all those cameras to spy on people, China should just ROLL out more facial recognition toilet paper dispensers instead.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[#MoonBase #LunarBase #MoonRushMOON  Half a century after the first man walked on the moon, another giant leap is in the works as mankind prepares to head back  and this time, doing more than just strollin'.In April 2019, NASA announced plans to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024, and build a permanent lunar base by 2028 under its Artemis program.IEEE Spectrum reports that getting to the moon involves super heavy-lift rockets. For its 2024 lunar mission, NASA is relying on the Space Launch System or SLS.Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are also developing their own heavy-lift launch vehicles, the Falcon Heavy and the New Glenn, respectively.NASA's lunar plans rely heavily on a space station called the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway, which will follow a near-rectilinear halo orbit around the moon."Gateway will serve as a staging post where astronauts can dock and leave their spacecraft, then travel to the lunar surface in a lander. It will also provide them shelter, a place to stock up on fuel and supplies and relay communications, and a base to dispatch crew and robots to the moon.Once humans actually get to the moon, the next step is building a permanent settlement, starting with habitats that are able to withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and abrasive moondust.IEEE Spectrum reports that some engineers and architects are using that same abrasive dust, known as regolith or lunar soil, to 3D-print habitats.Walls can either be 3D-printed all in one piece at the location where they'll stand, or as smaller materials like bricks that can lock together when stacked. Another approach, called sintering, uses solar power or microwave beams to heat regolith to near melting point, until it fuses.There's also the possibility of inflatable modules that can expand to greater capacity.To support life on the moon, habitats could use an open-loop system like the Apollo missions, where oxygen, food and water are provided, and waste disposed of on-site.A more likely system, though, would be the one employed by the ISS, which uses physicochemical processes to recycle water and air on the space station.But for a habitat to be sustainable, it will need to tap into local resources. Water doesn't exist on the lunar surface, but is likely available as ice that can be extracted from the moon's dark craters. One way to do this is by using a rover-mounted drill.Another concept called thermal mining redirects sunlight into a crater with heliostats, where it turns water in the regolith to vapor. The vapor collects in a tent and then condenses into pure water ice inside refrigerated cold traps. This can then be used to sustain settlers, or broken into hydrogen and oxygen to create rocket fuel.With no GPS on the moon, robotic rovers will also need to navigate the lunar surface and produce detailed 3D maps of the terrain.Many more scientists are working on lunar projects. Developing tech to allow high-bandwidth communications between earth and the moon, for example, or setting up a radio observatory on the far side of the moon.If we master all these and more, a human colony on the moon might become a reality sooner rather than later.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ITHACA, NEW YORK  New research has concluded that the bird population in North America has declined by 29 percent since 1970.The study published in the journal Science stated that almost 90 percent of the loss included common birds such as sparrows, blackbirds and swallows. Significant amounts of shorebirds, grasslands birds and forest bird populations have also declined.Researchers analyzed almost 50 years of bird-monitoring data collected from 143 radar stations across North America.Authors of the study noted that habitat loss may be the leading factor in bird decline, according to a news release from Cornell University. The study mentioned that birds are beneficial to the ecosystem as they disperse seeds and help with pest control.A website released with the study called 3billionbirds.org included a list of suggestions to help birds survive. This includes installing window screens on the outside of the window to prevent birds from crashing into windows, avoiding the use of pesticides and keeping your cat indoors.In the news release, the authors of the study mentioned that there is hope as birds such as hawks, eagles and other birds of prey have actually tripled their populations since 1970.Lead author of the study Kenneth Rosenberg from the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology said that none of these declines are hopeless, but that may not be true 10 years from now.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[JAMBI PROVINCE, INDONESIA  Wildfires in Indonesia caused the sky to take on an eerie red color over the weekend.Many took to Twitter to share photos and videos of the blood-red landscape, which looks straight out of an apocalyptic film.According to the Guardian, forest fires occur annually in Indonesia, usually as a result of using the slash-and-burn method to clear land for palm oil, paper, and pulp plantations. Though technically illegal in the country, the BBC reports that it has been allowed to continue unpunished for years.The fires create a smoky haze that can end up spreading throughout Southeast Asia, and have caused the skies over Indonesia's Jami province to turn a blood red hue."Singapore University of Social Sciences professor Koh Tieh Yong told the BBC that the phenomenon is due to Rayleigh scattering  the dispersal of light off of the molecules of  the air. This is the same process that makes the sky blue.According to Professor Koh, certain particles that are around 0.05 micrometers or less are more abundant during a period of haze, and provide an extra tendency to scatter more red light forwards and backwards than blue light.Looking up around noon, at the direct line of the sun, can also make the sky appear redder.While the phenomenon won't modify air temperature, the haze levels reported this year is one of the worst, and is affecting millions. According to Al Jazeera, residents of Jambi have had to wear masks to protect from the toxic smog. Many have reported respiratory problems as a result of the haze.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN  A Milwaukee couple may be regretting their super smart decision to have their house turned into a smart home after their Google Nest was hacked. According to Fox 6, the Westmorelands installed a Nest camera, doorbell and thermostat at their place in 2018. Things were all good until one day on September 17, when hackers decided to have some fun with the couple.  Fox 6 reported that when Samantha Westmoreland got back from work, the house felt like a dry sauna because the thermostat had been jacked up to 90 degrees. At first she thought it was just a glitch, so she set the temperature back to normal. Unfortunately hackers had other plans, and turned the temperature back up.That's when a voice began talking from a Nest camera in the kitchen. And for ambiance, Nest also started blasting loud music. Samantha then unplugged the camera, pointed it toward the ceiling and changed their password. Too bad that didn't work. According to Fox 6, the Westmorelands had to eventually get their internet service provider to change their network ID for their whole wireless network. Let this be a lesson people. Just because something says "smart" in front of it, doesn't make it so.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[YOUTUBE  Some of YouTube's biggest creators were hit with a massive wave of account hijacks, especially those in the auto-tuning and car review community. According to ZDNet, a bunch of big name car-related accounts were affected like Built, Troy Sowers, MaxtCheckVids, PURE Function and Musafir. ZDNet reported that other creators also said their accounts had been hijacked last week, particularly over the weekend. The account hacks appear to be coordinated and consisted of messages tricking creators to phishing sites, where hackers logged account credentials. Hackers then used this information to access Google accounts were they would re-assign popular channels to new owners. The hackers then changed the channel's vanity URL, giving the original creator and his or her followers the impression that their account had been deleted. The computer culprits were also able to bypass two-factor authentication on some accounts. So what can the 23 million YouTube creators out there do to keep themselves safe from the next attack? Easy, just make videos no one really wants to watch. You knowlike TomoNews.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA  New research has found that vapors from flavored e-cigarettes can be dangerous for the lungs.According to CBS, the liquid in e-cigarettes consist of a base made of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, with flavor added.It isn't simply "oil and water vapor" as some believe, but an oil and petroleum solution.RNZ reports that a study from the University of Adelaide and Royal Adelaide Hospital examined three brands of apple-flavored vaping liquid, with and without nicotine.Researchers found that the vapors were toxic to healthy bronchial epithelial cells that line the airways, and could trigger cell death.Extracts of the vapors were also found to interfere with the immune system by altering the function of cells that lock away dead and dying cells in the body, called macrophages.The effects were present even when the vapor contained no nicotine.The team says the next stage of research will focus on isolating which particular chemicals may be causing harm. The new study comes as another vaping-related death was reported in the U.S. last week, bringing the total to 8. Probable cases of vaping-related lung disease, meanwhile, have risen to 530, according to the New York Times.7News reports that no single vaping product or ingredient has so far been linked to these illnesses, though most reported vaping THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CHRISTIANSBURG, VIRGINIA  Alphabet's Wing is partnering with Walgreens to test a drone delivery pilot program in southwest Virginia this fall.Wing says the program is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program and will be one of the most advanced drone delivery trials ever conducted in the United States.Each drone weighs around 5 kg and can carry packages weighing up to 1.5 kilograms, according to Wing's website. The drones are able to fly around 20 kilometers per round trip.The drone will be capable of delivering over-the-counter medicines and other health products from Walgreens within minutes of a customer placing an order, according to a Medium blog post by Wing. The drone hovers around 7 meters above the ground and slowly lowers the package that is attached to a line.The package automatically disconnects from the line when goods touch the ground. The drone then flies away, allowing the customer to pick up their package.Customers living in the area will be able to sign up for the pilot program on Wing's website.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON D.C.  Donald Trump is facing an impeachment probe after claims he sought help from a foreign power to target a political rival. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, over allegations he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July call to investigate Joe Biden in exchange for the release of $391 million in aid. The New York Times reports that the call is believed to be the subject of a complaint from a whistleblower in the intelligence community, that the Trump administration has withheld from Congress.Both Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have accused Biden of improperly using his position as vice president to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to help his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukraine gas company. According to the Guardian, there is no evidence to support this claim.Biden is the current frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, who Trump will likely face in his bid for re-election.In her official announcement, Pelosi said the six House committees already investigating Trump will make recommendations to the House Judiciary Committee, which handles impeachment. Their reports could then form the articles of impeachment against the president.Said president was quick to respond to the announcement with a volley of tweets, calling the inquiry a "witch hunt" and crying "presidential harassment." According to the New York Times, the launch of a formal inquiry doesn't necessarily mean the House will vote to charge Trump with "high crimes and misdemeanors."But it's the likely outcome, given that Democrats hold a majority of seats, and only a simple majority vote is needed to indict.According to a New York Times survey, the number of House Democrats supporting impeachment is currently at 203  more than two thirds of the 235-member caucus.Independent representative Justin Amash from Michigan also favors starting an inquiry, while predictably, no Republican reps have come out as pro-impeachment.If the House moves forward with a charge, the proceedings move to the Senate for a trial presided over by the Supreme Court Chief Justice, with the Senate acting as jury.A conviction would require a two-thirds majority, but is unlikely to go through as the Senate is controlled by the Republicans.But according to Retuers, an impeachment inquiry alone will probably deal significant damage to Trump's image as he vies for re-election.Already, less than half of Americans approve of his performance as Commander-in-Chief, and even less than that will be with him if public hearings squeeze out some damning information.]]></videoDesc>

Houssian told reporters that he believes up to four criminals were involved in the heist and that the entire robbery lasted no longer than five minutes. He added that some wigs he stocks are "very exclusive" and worth up to $800, however, he said he was insured for his losses.

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[VENUS  New research shows that Venus may have once been habitable like Earth, before it was turned into a hell-like planet by a mysterious event.According to the Europlanet Society, NASA's Pioneer Venus found evidence in 1978 that Venus may have once had shallow oceans on its surface.To see if it has ever had a stable climate that can support liquid water, researchers from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies created a series of five simulations with different levels of water coverage.According to all five scenarios, Venus maintained a stable temperature of between 20 to 50 degrees Celsius for about 3 billion years. This means it would have been able to support liquid water, and possibly allow life to emerge.Researchers believe a massive resurfacing event 700 million years ago triggered an outgassing of carbon dioxide that made Venus' atmosphere too hot and dense for life to survive.The exact cause of the resurfacing event is unknown, but scientists say it may be linked to volcanic activity.Magma and molten rock flowing up to the surface would have released large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If magma solidifies before reaching the top, it can create a barrier that would have prevented gas from being reabsorbed.Although more missions are needed to better understand Venus' history and evolution, the recent findings have implications for exoplanets in the "Venus-zone", and how they may actually host liquid water and temperate climates.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ARCTIC  A walrus launched a sneak attack on a Russian Navy landing boat in the Arctic Ocean last week. CNN reports that the Russian Ministry of Defense said the female animal was protecting its calves when it targeted the inflatable boat carrying researchers to the shore of Cape Geller in the Arctic. According to CNN, those on board were sailors and scientists with a joint expedition by Russia's naval fleet in the Arctic, the Northern Fleet, and the Russian Geographical Society. According to an RGO spokesperson, while the inflatable was sinking, the crew leader was able to get the boat close enough to shore so that everyone was able to get ashore safely. The Russian Navy decided to spruce up their press release a bit by saying, "a group of researchers had to flee from a female walrus, which, protecting its cubs, attacked an expedition boat. Serious troubles were avoided thanks to the clear and well-coordinated actions of the Northern Fleet servicemen." According to Ars Technica, the expedition is exploring previous routes of Arctic expeditions in the archipelago and carrying out glacial and biological surveys of the islands. According to the Northern Fleet, no walruses were harmed in the incident.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  China is planning to roll out new controls on tobacco liquid and additives for vaping amid the hype over deaths and illnesses connected to e-cigarettes.The China News Service said on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources at the State Tobacco Monopoly, that new rules would be introduced as early as next month and will cover e-cig devices and packaging. According to the AP, India banned sales of e-cigs this month and regulators in the U.S. and other countries are imposing controls following vaping deaths and complications.China is home to the world's biggest tobacco market, with around 350 million smokers. According to CNS, vaping companies in China invested at least $140 million in 2018, while 35 deals were made in the first half of the year. China banned sales of e-cigs to people under 18 in August of 2018. Well, that's kind of a no-brainer. CNS also reported that In July, the country's National Health Commission said studies found aerosol from vapes contained toxic elements and that additives could pose a health risk. Funny thing is, if people and governments are so concerned about preventable deaths, why isn't everyone up in arms over smoking?According to the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, good old fashioned cigarettes cause more than 7 million deaths a year. But yeah, let's continue that crackdown on vaping.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ISRAEL  A lady in Israel has become the first woman to ever get broken heart syndrome from food, after her guacamole dreams were dashed by its evil twin.According to a report in BMJ Case Reports, the whole thing started at a wedding, when a woman in her late 60s spotted what she thought was avocado dip. Boy was she wrong.After the lady downed a sizeable amount of the green thing, she realized  pretty quickly that it was wasabi. Immediately after, she felt a sudden pressure in her chest that then radiated to her arms.She ended up staying at the wedding, and the pain eventually began to die down.The next day, though, the poor woman felt weak and uncomfortable, and went to see a doctor, who diagnosed him with broken heart syndrome. Also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome sees severe weakening of the heart's left ventricle after a stressful event. The ventricle takes on the shape of a Japanese octopus-trapping pot, which is where the condition gets its name.It's typically triggered by extreme emotional or physical stress, like the death of a pet or loved one. There have also been cases where it's been linked to anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction, but this is the first time food consumption has spurred it on.Or you know, maybe she was just THAT distraught over the avocado.]]></videoDesc>

One inmate saunters to the middle of the rec area holding an orange jail shirt, which he readies to use as a catcher while he follows the drone. When the drone drops its load, he lunges to catch it...and misses. A black pouch clatters to the ground, and clumsy-pants quickly drops the shirt over it, before picking it up. He then casually walks away like he didn't just get busted by the surveillance cams. According to authorities, the contraband pouch contained a cell phone and buddha.News 5 Cleveland reports that the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation following the incident.]]></videoDesc>

Unfortunately the white dog didn't make it and was buried soon after.Commentators in China were quick to share their feelings with one saying, "Pay more attention when you're driving, don't injure dogs!"Another made a statement to the driver who hit the poor dog saying that: "How can you eat and sleep after what you have done?"

The national day parade will take place around Tiananmen Square amid heavy security. Only those invited will be allowed to attend. China has banned any low-flying aerial vehicles such as light aircraft, drones, balloons and even racing pigeons from flying in the area on the day of the celebration.Passengers on trains and vehicles heading to Beijing are already facing multiple safety checks ahead of the anniversary.According to the BBC, Chinese social media platforms like Weibo have said that they are deleting content that "insults" or "distorts" the nation's history in a bid to tighten online control.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[FREMONT, CALIFORNIA  A Tesla electric police car involved in a high-speed chase was forced to say uncle halfway through because it ran out of juice.According to Mercury News, Officer Jesse Hartman was out last Friday on patrol in his  Fremont Police Department Tesla Model S when he became involved in a hot pursuit. Mercury News reported the chase began in Fremont and even reached top speeds of around 120 mph on the freeway. Officer Hartman's Tesla was humming along fine and leading the chase, when he started to notice the car was low on batteries.According to Fremont Police dispatch audio obtained through Broadcastify, Hartman can be heard saying, "just realized I am down to six miles of battery on the Tesla, so I may lose it here in a sec."He continues, "if someone else is able, can they maneuver into the number one spot?" According to CNN, other units following the Tesla then took over the pursuit with help from the California State Highway Patrol. Unfortunately, the chase had to be called off after 10 minutes because the suspect started to drive too dangerously. CNN reported that California State Highway Patrol later found the suspect's car abandoned in San Jose. According to a Fremont police department spokeswoman, apparently the Tesla had not been recharged after an earlier shift before Hartman took it out last Friday. The Fremont police are currently involved in a 6 month pilot program with Tesla to determine whether electric vehicles can be rolled out on a larger scale for police use.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WUHAN, CHINA  We've all been there before, fidgeting with that tiny little nozzle with no luck and stuck on the tarmac for way too long with that stuffy cabin air. Wellone woman in China found a surprisingly fresh way to get some air onto the plane while it was taxiing by popping the emergency exit door open. According to the SCMP citing Chinese media, the incident occurred on Xiamen Air flight MF8215 from Wuhan to Lanzhou on Monday afternoon. Prior to takeoff, the womanwho appeared to be in her fiftieswas told not to pull on the emergency door lever as she was sitting in an exit row. The plane had been scheduled to take off at 3:45 p.m., but apparently the lady had other plans.She was in need of "a breath of fresh air", so what does she do? She pulls the emergency door lever of course. The entire flight was then forced to wait on the runway as the airport police arrived to arrest the woman. Luckily for the passengers, the flight was only delayed an hour, which in China is considered on time. Wuhan airport police have yet to release the woman's name and her punishment, but it looks like someone's social credit score could be taking a bit of a nosedive.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA['MURICA  The wait is finally over as Samsung's Galaxy Flop officially relaunches across the U.S. of A. after its horrible crash and burn of a release back in April earlier this year. For those of you that forgot, Samsung was forced to shelve the Galaxy Fold almost immediately after it dropped because it couldn't really fold.  But now for the ultra-affordable price of only $2,000, the all not-so-new Galaxy Flop and its 7.3-inch interior screen can be yours.The new Flop now has a strengthened hinge area, so you can flop it whenever you want, as long as it's not too hard. Samsung also extended the top protective layer to make it more obvious that you're not supposed to rip it off.  The Flop also comes with quite an extensive list of things you can't or shouldn't do with the phone. Keep sharp things like fingernails away from the flexible screen. Avoid putting it in your pocket with things you put in your pockets like keys and coins. Keep the Flop away from your plastic because the magnets in the phone could wipe your credit cards clean. But fear not, Samsung is almost positive you're going to have serious issues with the Flop, so that's why it also dedicated a 24-hour call center just for Flop users. Having the option to be put on hold at anytime of the day is definitely great customer service.  So if you absolutely have nothing better to do with two grand, then flop on over to select locations of Best Buy, AT&T stores and Samsung Experience stores to get your floppable Samsung Flop today.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The U.S. is deploying a drone disabling microwave weapon overseas for the first time.The Pentagon announced that it has awarded a $16.28 million contract to Raytheon for a prototype high-power microwave weapons system. The U.S. Air Force will deploy the weapon overseas at an unspecified location for a year-long assessment.The system, called PHASER, can disable drones weighing less than 55 pounds that fly at altitudes of 1,200 to 3,500 feet and speeds of 115 to 230 miles per hour. According to Popular Mechanics, these include drones like the RQ-11 Raven and ScanEagle.PHASER projects radio frequencies in a conical beam that can disrupt or destroy a drone's internal systems.It is an electric-field effect rather than a thermal one, but the results are instantaneous. The Drive reports that targeted drones either fall out of the sky or initiate a pre-programmed emergency procedure.The weapon has anti-swarm potential, having been designed to counter groups of drones simultaneously. It also has an unlimited magazine that can help repel sustained attacks from multiple groups of drones.Fox News reports that the move appears timely due to the recent drone strikes on two oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia.However, according to Raytheon's chief technologist for direct energy Don Sullivan, the plan has been in the works since late last year.Around 20 drones and cruise missiles were used to carry out the Saudi oil attacks, and according to Popular Mechanics, some of the drones may have been small enough to be disabled by PHASER.The HPM system, however, is not known to work on cruise missiles, says the Air Force and Raytheon.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  A senior lawyer has urged the United Nations to investigate the issue of forced organ harvesting in China.In a speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Sept. 24, Hamid Sabi presented evidence from the China Tribunal, a panel looking into the issue of organ harvesting in China.He stated that hundreds and thousands have fallen victim to organ harvesting, mainly members of Falun Gong, a spiritual group, as well as the Muslim Uyghur minority ethnic group.Falun Gong has been banned in China since 10,000 members staged a silent protest outside the headquarters of the ruling Communist Party in Beijing in 1999.Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs have been detained by the Chinese government and sent to reeducation camps since 2019, the New York Times reports.In a report released by the China Tribunal, the panel said organ harvesting involves cutting out the heart and other organs such as the kidneys, liver, lungs, cornea and skin from prisoners of conscious.The organs are then offered to patients who have to wait as little as two weeks to receive a transplant.In comparison, the report noted that patients in other parts of the world have to wait months or years to receive an organ transplant.China has repeatedly denied accusations of forced organ harvesting and claims that it stopped extracting organs from executed prisoners in 2015, Reuters reports.]]></videoDesc>
