        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SPACE  Recent data retrieved from NASA's OSIRIS-REx space probe shows water is locked inside the asteroid Bennu.OSIRIS-REx began approaching the asteroid between mid-August and early December. It traveled about 2.2 million kilometers from Earth until it reached a location 19 kilometers from Bennu.Once positioned, OSIRIS-REx proceeded to collect data from the asteroid using the Osiris Visible and Infrared Spectrometer and Osiris Thermal Emission Spectrometer.The data revealed the presence of hydroxyl molecules, which are made up of oxygen and hydrogen atoms.Hydroxyl molecules are found in water-bearing clay minerals. This finding suggests that Bennu has previously interacted with water.OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to enter Bennu's orbit on Dec. 31 and will remain within its orbit until mid-February 2019.The spacecraft will orbit the asteroid at a range of 1.4 kilometers to 2 kilometers, making Bennu the smallest planetary body ever to be orbited by a spacecraft.OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to collect samples from Bennu's surface in mid-2020. After mapping and selecting a site to collect samples of the asteroid, the spacecraft will use its Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism to extract rocks and dirt from the asteroid's surface.The Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism is an 11-foot robotic arm that uses nitrogen to stir up loose dirt and rocks from the asteroid's surface. The dirt particles are then collected and stored in a canister that is later placed inside a heatproof Sample Return Capsule.The spacecraft is expected to travel back to Earth and drop off the capsule containing the samples in September 2023.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MADISON, WISCONSIN  Engineers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed a high-tech band-aid that uses electrical stimulation to heal wounds.The band-aid is made using sheets of polytetrafluoroethylene, copper foil and polyethylene terephthalate, according to a study published in the journal ACS Nano.In a University of Wisconsin-Madison news release, Professor Xudong Wang explained the band-aid consists of tiny electrodes that send out electric pulses generated from the body movements of the wearer once it is applied on the wound.These band-aids were tested on rodents and results showed that the electrical band-aid reduced healing time to three days, compared to 12 days for the rodents that were given a normal band-aid.The technology could be used to heal chronic skin wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers and non-healing surgical wounds, according to the study.Wang explained in the news release that the device is as convenient as "a bandage you put on your skin."Wang added that she believes the device would be just a bit more expensive than a regular band-aid.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CANARY ISLANDS  Frenchman Jean-Jacques Savin, 71, is travelling across the Atlantic Ocean in a large, orange barrel.The barrel is 3 meters in length and 2.10 meters in width, according to Savin's website.The interior of the barrel consists of a six-square-meter living space, which includes a tiny kitchen and a sleeping bunk along with a pothole for Savin to enjoy the view.Savin explains on his website that he brought along satellite technology and equipment to gather data about the ocean. He also took an amphora of white wine and a block of foie gras.Savin set sail from El Hierro in the Canary Islands and is attempting to reach the Caribbean using only ocean currents and winds to propel his barrel, the New York Times reports.Savin is sharing his progress on social media by sharing pictures and tracking GPS coordinates. He plans to celebrate New Years' and his 72nd birthday at sea. Savin raised money for the journey through crowdfunding and receiving partial funding from two barrel makers.On his website, atlantique-tonneau.com, Savin states that he has already crossed the Atlantic four times using only a sailboat.]]></videoDesc>

These minerals were found 6,000 meters beneath sea level near Japan's Minamitorishima Island in April 2018,according to a study published in the journal Nature.An estimated 16 million ton of rare minerals including yttrium, dysprosium, europium and terbium have been found in the deposit.These rare earth minerals are used in smartphones and electric cars as well as rechargeable batteries.It is rare for large amounts of minerals to be found in huge deposits, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Japan started looking for rare-earth minerals after a dispute with China, which is currently the largest exporter of rare earths minerals, according to a Reuters report.In 2014, China held back shipments of rare-earth minerals to Japan during a row over disputed islands between the two nations.At the same time, China cut back its export of rare-earth minerals and increased the price of the minerals to preserve its resources.After China, the largest amount of rare earth reserves are found in Vietnam, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and India, according to Statista 2018.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HORSEY, UNITED KINGDOM  A picture of a seal pup catching some shut eye on a dirty plastic bottle is probably one of the cutestand the most disturbing images you'll ever see. According to Lad Bible, amateur photographer John Evered, 52, spotted the gray seal pup, along with hundreds of other seals on a beach in Horsey, Norfolk.Gray seals come ashore in large groups every year on the east coast of England to give birth to their young. The problem now is that seals are facing an increasing threat from microplastics pollution. The toxins released from the plastics can increase the chance of developing diseases. Seals often suffer for many years before dying from plastics poisoning.Around 12.7 million tonnes of plastic garbage end up in our oceans every year. But the big problem now is that a lot of this plastic is being accidentally consumed by marine animals, which then appear on our plates as seafood.  While we still aren't fully sure what eating microplastics does to humans, it doesn't take a genius to figure out none of it can be good.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA  A picture is worth a thousand words, or is it?Apparently, flaunting your relationship online is not #relationshipgoals.Relationship guru Nikki Goldstein told the Daily Mail Australia that couples who are constantly parading their wuv on social media might be dealing with the most problems.A lot of these picture-perfect posts are not intended to capture cute moments but used to seek validation in the form of likes and reactions.According to Goldstein, "The likes and comments can be so validating that when someone is really struggling, that's where they get their up from  not the person making the gesture, but what other people will say about it."But not all photos are bad. Goldstein talks specifically about those photos that are just too perfect to be "genuine" or "candid" as the people posting them want us to believe.She instead encourages couples who wish to post on social media to share authentic moments of their relationship instead of sappy Nicholas Sparks-inspired photos.Goldstein encourages couples to ask themselves, "Are we more concerned about how the relationship actually is, or are we more interested in how it looks online?"]]></videoDesc>

According to Lad Bible, Kim Fryer's daughter popped down for breakfast around 7 a.m. on December 15. When she got to the kitchen however, she found it in shambles with a bunch of plants smashed and mud everywhere, and chilling on top of the microwave was Mr. Fox. As the family has five cats and a dog, the fox most likely got into the house through the cat clap.  The daughter went to grab her mom, who came down and saw the fox was a little out of it, so she called the RSPCA.Inspector Phil Norman took the little guy to the Putney Animal Hospital in London, where vets looked him over and kept him for monitoring. Turns out the little fellow was in good health, so after a quick checkup, he was released back into the woods close to where he was found by a hospital staff worker.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM  Police are treating the stabbing of three people, including a police officer, on New Year's Eve at the Manchester Victoria railway station as a terrorist investigation. The stabbings occurred around 20:50 GMT when a 25-year-old suspect attacked a man and woman in their 50s, according to the Greater Manchester Police. The woman suffered injuries to her face and stomach, while the man sustained wounds to his stomach. A British Transport Police officer, who responded to the scene, was also stabbed in the shoulder. All three victims' injuries were described as "serious" but not life-threatening. The police officer was released from the hospital on Tuesday. According to witnesses,  police used pepper spray and a Taser to detain the attacker, who had been resisting arrest. Six or seven police officers were seen on top of the suspect, before he was finally arrested. According to the BBC, two knives were recovered at the scene and a residence is being searched in the Cheetham Hill area.  The attacker is currently being held on the suspicion of attempted murder.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[AMERICA  Advances in artificial intelligence software has led to the proliferation of fake digital images and videos referred to as "deepfakes."According to Neimen Lab, deepfakes use several techniques including faceswaps and  grafting a lip-syncing mouth or expression onto someone's face. According to MIT Technology Review, the technology behind deepfakes are called generative adversarial networks, or GANs. Media outlets like the Wall Street Journal are now training their journalists to detect deepfakes by finding older versions of footage using reverse image search engines like Google Images and Tineye. Reporters can also use video editing programs to look at clips frame-by-frame to look for distortions in the video. According to MIT Technology Review, experts say this is just the beginning for GANs. In the future algorithms will become more refined and harder to identify as fakes.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SUNDA STRAIT, INDONESIA  The Indonesian volcano which caused a tsunami that killed more than 400 people last week now measures only 110 meters after losing two-thirds of its height.Anak Krakatau is a stratovolcano located in the Sunda Strait. Stratovolcanoes form through the accumulation of layers of viscous lava and ash through multiple eruptions.According to Volcano Discovery, the volcano has been active since around 1928. Its eruptions are strombolian.According to Science Magazine, strombolian eruptions occur when gas inside the volcano form bubbles called gas slugs. Gas slugs then rise through the magma column and throw magma into the air when they burst.Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation has analyzed images of the volcano from a number of radar satellites, including the European Union's Sentinel-1 constellation, the German TerraSAR-X platform, and Japan's Space agency. These show Anak Krakatoa, which used to stand at roughly 340 meters high, now just measuring 110 meters. According to AFP, the steady eruptions caused rock and ash from the volcano to gradually slide into the sea causing it to lose about 150 and 180 million cubic meters of material.Anak Krakatau, whose name translates to "Child of Krakatoa",  was formed around 1928 in the crater left by Krakatoa, the infamous volcano whose massive eruption in 1883 triggered a period of global cooling.According to local authorities, the tsunami caused by the eruption has left 7,202 people injured, 29 people missing and 43,386 people displaced.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SHENZHEN, CHINA   Thought Facebook was nosy? Now even checking the weather might put you at the mercy of the Chinese data police.A popular Chinese Android weather app called "Weather Forecast - World Weather Accurate Radar" has been collecting an "unusual amount of data" and subscribing some users to extra paid services without their consent, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.The app is from Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer TCL Communication Technology Holdings Ltd., which also manufactures Alcatel and Blackberry phones. The suspicious activity was detected by a UK security firm called Upstream Systems.Upstream found the app collects the users' email address, geographic location and international mobile equipment identity, a unique number used to identify mobile phones.  The app also secretly subscribed 100,000 of the company's Alcatel users in countries including Brazil, Malaysia and Nigeria to paid virtual-reality services without their consent.The app is also sending data back to servers in China.Upstream stated that had they not reported the surreptitious subscriptions, users may have been forced to pay over $1.5 million for the extra services.The app currently has roughly 10 million downloads and about 45,000 reviews on the Google Play Store app.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HUAZHONG, CHINA  China's new experimental radio antenna facility has been built on land that is 3,700 sq km in size and could possible be used for the Chinese military.The radio antenna will have the ability to emit extremely low frequency radio waves, called ELF waves, the South China Morning Post reports.The facility was built in the Huazhong region in central China.The World Health Organization has previously linked ELF waves to cancer.These radio waves will be emitted at a frequency of 0.1 to 300 hertz.They could be picked up by Chinese military submarines that are hundreds of meters deep in the ocean. However, the radio antenna could also be used to detect earthquakes and minerals.The project is a part of China's 11th five-year-plan, which Beijing uses to set targets, guidelines and policy goals for the coming years.China is downplaying the importance of the radio antenna facility in order to avoid causing public alarm, according to the South China Morning Post.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LAUREL, MARYLAND  NASA has discovered a celestial object beyond Pluto and it looks like a snowman.According to the Associated Press, the objects are called "Ultima Thule." This translates roughly to '"beyond the known world. It consists of two fused spheres with one being larger than the other. It is around 21 miles in length.NASA's New Horizons spacecraft sent back images of the mysterious space snowman on New Year's Day."Ultima Thule" is said to be reddish in color. Scientists placed a high resolution image on top of the photo its spacecraft grabbed to recreate what they believe it looks like.A NASA scientist told the AP that the spheres were formed in space billions of years ago and that the icy pieces fused together. Its exterior is believed to be a mix of water, methane and nitrogen.The scientists involved are calling the snowman-like object "a primordial planetesimal." That's essentially a small celestial object that isn't an asteroid, or a comet.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ZUNYI, CHINA  A man in southern China is hilariously suing his "friends" after they hazed him as part of some lame Chinese wedding tradition.Supposedly, most men put up with the wedding day hazing, but Ai Guangtao decided to lawyer up after his pals cracked his skull open and saddled him with some big bills. To get things started, Ai's friends pelted him with eggs, then dumped beer and ink all over him. Then they taped him to an electric pole, so they could whip him with bamboo. Ai then did what any normal Chinese man would do. He ran away in fear, while his good buddies chased him down.  At one point, Ai tried to run across the highway where he was surprisingly hit by a car. According to the SCMP, the 24-year-old groom spent two weeks in the hospital with a boatload of injuries, including a cracked noggin. The po po blamed Ai for the fender bender, which he now has to shell out $4,400 for. So now he's manning up and suing his friends.]]></videoDesc>

Durian is popular throughout Asia and is known for its rather unique and fragrant gym sock-esque aroma. According to the Shanghaiist, the woman thought it would be cool to bring the pungent fruit with her to the train station in the Zhejiang city of Quzhou. Security personnel informed her it would not be. Rather than just toss the fruit, she borrowed a saw from someone and proceeded to hack and saw at it. After finally getting it open, she starts going to town on it.  She scarfs down the whole durian with time to spare to catch her train.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  China's dramatic decrease of particulate matter has triggered a rise in ground-level ozone pollution.China has managed to reduce levels of fine particulate matter emissions by roughly 40 percent in just four years.However, research from Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology shows this quick fall has triggered a rise in ground-level ozone pollution.According to the paper published in PNAS, researchers studied roughly 1,000 sites in China over the past five years. Their findings showed an increase of surface ozone levels in urban clusters of China, particularly Beijing and Shanghai. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, ground-level ozone is one of the main components of smog.Ground-level ozone is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen, known as NOX, and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, under the presence of heat and sunlight.The study indicates that particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, acts as an absorbing agent of the radicals that make up ozone pollution.Its sharp decrease has left more radicals available to generate ground-level ozone. Researchers said in an article on the Harvard school's website that "extra efforts are needed to reduce NOx and VOC emissions in order to stem the tide of ozone pollution."According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ground-level ozone is linked to aggravation of pulmonary diseases, lung and throat irritation, and higher probabilities of contracting a respiratory illness.]]></videoDesc>

Brian David Boyack and some other adults were chatting in the hot tub when he and a banker got into a heated argument over big corporations and conspiracy theorists. The banker ended up locking Boyack out of the house.The 43-year-old picked up patio furniture and began hitting the front house windows, prompting the banker to come out and tell him to stop.Boyack came at the man and pinned him to the ground. He reportedly bit a chunk off the poor dude's left ear before fleeing in his truck.The largely earless man ended up at a hospital, where he told police what happened. Officers searched for Boyack, who later turned himself in.Fox News reports that the Tyson fan is facing charges for mayhem, domestic violence in the presence of a child, criminal mischief, and intoxication.ABC4 reports that according to the victim, doctors wouldn't be able to reattach the part of his ear that got bit off, which means he'll need reconstruction surgery later.]]></videoDesc>

Beyond 1 and Beyond 2 are both expected to utilize an in-display fingerprint sensor and curved glass, while the Beyond O uses a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and a flat display. The top and bottom bezels for the Beyond 1 look even slimmer that the S9 version. There's also a punch hole display cutout that houses a front-facing camera. There's also still a visible speaker on top of the phone. It looks like the new S10 will also offer reverse wireless charging. That should do wonders for your battery life. Will the new S10 come with Bixby? God we hope not.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  Taiwan and other countries in Asia are currently under high alert for African swine fever as the outbreak continues to rise in China.China continues to loosen rules amid the outbreak to ensure the supply of pork in the country ahead of the Lunar Year of the Pig, according to a Reuters report.African Swine Fever is caused by the DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health.Symptoms include high fever, redness on the ears, abdomen and legs, and diarrhea. In serious cases, it can cause death within 6 to 13 days.The disease is spread through direct contact with infected pigs. It could also be spread through indirect contact if the pigs consume contaminated food waste.China has already reported more than 90 cases of African Swine Fever since August last year.The deadly virus could survive in processed pork for a few months. It could also survive for years in frozen pig carcasses, according to the Guardian.China previously banned the transport of pigs from outbreak regions, but continues to allow pigs from unaffected regions to be freely transported to other areas in the country.Beijing also banned the use of food waste and pig blood in the production of pig feed in September 2018.African Swine Fever is fatal for pigs but the disease does not harm humans.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TOKYO  Japanese researchers have developed a biologger that can be attached to a sperm whale's body.The device will use robotic technology to gather valuable information regarding the mammal's biology and behavior. The team behind the technology is comprised of researchers from Yamagata University and Teikyo University of Science. The biologger is powered by water currents generated as the whale swims. It uses flexible suction cups to cling onto and travel along the whale's body. The device has a so far successfully traveled across a flat surface at a depth of roughly 500 meters.The team plans to conduct its first experiments in the ocean around the Ogasawara islands, an area known to be inhabited by dolphins and whales, located 1,000 kilometers south of Tokyo.According to the science news website, TechXplore, the team's main objective is to capture video of sperm whales hunting and eating a giant squid.In order to achieve this, the rover will use its suction cups to travel to an area close to the whale's mouth.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MOON  China's lunar probe has made history as the first spacecraft to touch down on the far side of the moon.Xinhua reports that the Chang'e 4 lunar craft lifted off from the Xichang Satellite launch center in Sichuan province on December 8, carrying a lander and a rover. It entered lunar orbit four days later.At 10:26 a.m. local Beijing time on January 3, the spacecraft landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the moon's largest and oldest impact crater.According to CNN, the rover separated from the lander on several hours after touchdown, and is expected to roam and explore the Von Karman crater.According to Space.com, the six-wheeled rover is equipped with a panoramic camera and a visible and near-Infrared imaging spectrometer.The lander is outfitted with a landing camera, terrain camera, and a low-frequency spectrometer. It will conduct low-frequency radio astronomy observations and see whether plants can grow in the low-gravity environment. It will also explore whether there is water or other resources at the poles.The New York Times reports that the probe has sent back the first close-up image of the moon's far side back to Earth using the relay satellite Queqiao.China's future space missions include sending a Chang'e 5 spacecraft to the moon next year that will return to Earth with samples, according to the Washington Post. A crewed mission is also in the works and slated for the early 2030s.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, UK  The Cancer Research UK Cambridge Center is launching a two-year clinical trial of a new breath test device that aims to identify molecules linked to certain cancers.According to a press release, the procedure will be tested on 1,500 participants including cancer patients and healthy participants.The technology is called Breath Biopsy and was developed by Owlstone Medical, a company dedicated to developing non-invasive cancer detection technology.The device used in these tests is called ReCIVA Breath Sampler. It analyzes molecules called Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOCs, present in exhaled breath.Cells regularly produce VOCs as part of their normal metabolic processes. Researchers participating in the trial believe the presence of cancerous cells could cause identifiable changes in VOC patterns. The ReCIVA is designed to detect these alterations.Participants will need to breathe into the device for 10 minutes. Samples of the participants' breath containing VOCs are collected in the device's Breath Biopsy Cartridge and then sent to a laboratory in Cambridge for analysis. The trial will be testing patients suspected to have esophageal, stomach, kidney, bladder, prostate, liver and pancreatic cancer.The results of the trials are expected to be published by 2021.David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK, said in the press release: "Technologies such as this breath test have the potential to revolutionize the way we detect and diagnose cancer in the future."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SOUTH CHINA SEA  China has lodged stern complaints with the U.S. after an American navy vessel conducted patrols near disputed islands in the South China Sea.According to the spokesperson for the U.S. Pacific fleet, the USS McCampbell sailed within 12 nautical miles of the China-claimed Paracel Islands as part of a "freedom of navigation" operation. It was reportedly done to "challenge excessive maritime claims." China responded by dispatching military aircraft and naval vessels to identify the U.S. destroyer and warn it to leave the area.According to Al Jazeera, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang claims the U.S. ship "violated Chinese and international law, infringed on chinese sovereignty, and undermined peace and stability."The South China Sea has long been contentious. Several countries have competing claims based on their exclusive economic zones, but China claims the entire body based on historic rights, using a nine-dash line to demarcate its territory.Since 2013, China has been building artificial islands in both the Paracels and Spratlys to bolster its claim.Washington has also expressed opposition over Beijing's militarization of the South China Sea, and its addition of military installations like radars and airstrips to islands and reefs.China has defended the construction as necessary for self defense, alleging that the U.S. is the one to blame for heightening tensions in the area with their patrols.This latest incident comes as talks between the two sides get underway in Beijing, following a 90-day truce on a bitter trade war that saw import tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  A Chinese military scholar has said that disputes over ownership of the South China Sea could be resolved by sinking two U.S. aircraft carriers.News.com.au reports that in a speech delivered in Shenzhen on December 20, Chinese Rear Admiral Luo Yuan claims China's new anti-ship missiles are more than capable of hitting American carriers. The loss of just one carrier could result in 5,000 casualties.China's Dongfeng-21D and Dongfeng-26 missiles are referred to as 'aircraft carrier killers.'According to the Maritime Executive, the Dongfeng-21D is a ballistic missile with a range of 800 nautical miles and a velocity of Mach 10. Its warhead is deployed in two stages and is designed to take out an aircraft carrier.The Dongfeng-26 is more recently developed, with a much longer range of 2,200 nautical miles and reportedly armed with a hypersonic glide vehicle.This allows it to maneuver on a variable, low-altitude terminal trajectory, and makes it more difficult to track and hit than conventional ballistic reentry vehicles that fall on a predetermined path.The DF-26 is intended to penetrate advanced air defense systems - made possible by its speed, below-the-radar approach track, and ability to take evasive action. It reportedly has more range than U.S. Navy fighters, which means a a carrier strike group launching an attack would need to first enter within the missile system's sphere of influence.The existence and capabilities of these weapons take on a more chilling undertone following Chinese President's Xi Jinping's January 1 remarks on the inevitability of Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.The Straits Times reports that Xi promised opportunities for the island nation under the 1992 Consensus of one China, two systems, but warned that pushing for independence would incur military wrath.In response, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan will never accept China's one-country-two-systems model, adding that most Taiwanese are opposed to it, according to Focus Taiwan.Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council claims the same system is being implemented in Hong Kong and depriving people of freedom, something the people of Taiwan would never allow.]]></videoDesc>

The cake was still wrapped in red icing, giving an illusion of a proper cake.The caterers also failed to provide food for the guests, forcing the couple to visit a nearby restaurant to purchase noodles, rice and other street foods, according to the DailyMail.The bride, the groom and the guests went to a local police station with officers inspecting the wedding cake and confirming that the cake base was made entirely of styrofoam.The bride said she had "never been so humiliated," adding that the wedding planner "needs to go to jail" for ruining her wedding.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING   We itch, we scratch, we scratch, we itch, what is the science behind this annoying cycle?A recent study published in the journal Neuron reveals that a small category of neurons located in an area of the brain called the periaqueductal gray tracks itch-evoked scratching behavior in mice.  Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied periaqueductal gray neurons of freely moving mice that were induced to scratch through injections containing histamine, or chloroquine. Histamine is an organic compound involved in itch perception and chloroquine is a medication used to treat malaria.The team then studied the itch-induced scratching behavior by observing the activity of a set of neurons that produce a neurotransmitter called tachykinin 1 or Tac1 which produces glutamate and neuropeptides.Scientists observed that when Tac-1 neurons were eliminated itch-induced scratching also decreased.Stimulating these neurons, on the other hand, resulted in spontaneous scratching behavior even without using histamine and chloroquine injections.Scientists participating in the study will continue to investigate which molecules in the Tac1 can be targeted by drugs. This would allow for the development of a drug that could be used to treat patients with chronic itch.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[PRIMORSKY KRAI, RUSSIA  We all know tigers and humans don't get on very well  just look at The Jungle Book. But one tiger in Siberia defied its instincts, emerging from the wild to seek help for an injury.The Siberian Times reports that the endangered male Amur tiger, who goes by Tikhon, showed up at a remote border post between Russia and China on December 29.Russian border guards tried to scare him away by firing warning shots, but the big cat stayed put. He was still in the area five days later.When Tikhon helped himself to two guard dogs, the men noticed that the tiger seemed wounded. He was limping and crouching on his hind legs.Siberian tigers usually shun human contact, leading wildlife rangers to believe the atypical behavior meant this one had purposefully come for help.National park rangers decided to take the tiger in. They shot Tikhon with a sedative and used a truck to move him to a rehabilitation center for big cats.Tikhon is 15 years old, and an old man by tiger standards. He played a key role in helping the survival of his species, but may not be able to return to the wild again due to his old age.Experts are now waiting for test results so they can assess the big cat's injuries and diseases, and figure out what to do next.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CHENZHOU, CHINA  An intelligent Chinese man has been experiencing serious organ failure ever since he sold one of his kidneys for an iPhone 4 when he was a teenager.  According to Next Shark, local news in China identified the genius as Xiao Wang, who was 17 years old back in 2011, when Apple's latest phone was the iPhone 4. Apparently, Wang's family was broke and didn't have the money for fancy, overpriced phone, which at the time ran between $600-$700 bucks. Wang then found a shady middleman to help him sell his kidney on the black market. After the arrangements were made, Wang met with an underground doctor and gave away one of his kidneys just like that.   And what was Wang's big compensation? A measly $3,202 bones for a vital organ. Strangely, Wang almost immediately developed complications after his operation wound became infected. He eventually suffered complete kidney failurethat's odd.Wang's family has since had to shell out $320,284 for medical costs and treatment. He now gets to enjoy his days in bed and is constantly on dialysis. Yeah, but the real question isdoes he still have that iPhone 4?]]></videoDesc>

It unloaded oil cargo in Dongguan, China on Sunday, and stopped one nautical mile from Hong Kong's Lamma Island to refuel while en route to Thailand.While connecting hoses with an oil barge on Tuesday morning, crew members reportedly heard three explosions on the tanker.As fire broke out on the tanker's deck, sailors fell or jumped into the sea to escape the growing blaze.It took firefighters five hours to extinguish the flames on the tanker. One man died and seven others were injured, among them a Singaporean crew on the oil barge. Two are still missing.Yiu Men-yeung, Fire Services Department's division commander for marine and diving, told the South China Morning Post that there was no risk of the vessel sinking or of an oil leak, despite it tilting 30 degrees.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL  A man was treated to the most up close and personal MMA fight of his life after he tried jacking UFC fighter Polyana Viana's phone on Saturday night. Viana told MMA Junkie that she was waiting for an Uber in front of her apartment in Rio de Janeiro around 8 p.m. when a guy approached her and got all up in her space. He sat down right next to Viana and then asked her for the time. When she went to put her phone away, he told her to hand it over because he was armed. The would-be mugger then put his hand over what looked to be a gun, but Viana thought it looked too soft to be real. Turns out the mugger was too soft to be real as well. According to Viana, "he was really close to me. So I thought, 'If it's a gun, he won't have time to draw it.' So I stood up. I threw two punches and a kick. He fell, then I caught him with a rear-naked choke. Then I sat him down in the same place we were before and said, 'Now we'll wait for the police.'"After getting humiliatingly pummeled by Viana, the po po showed up to discover the guy's gun was just made out of cardboard.  The man was first taken to the hospital, then to the station where Viana filed a police report. Turns out the human punching bag has been in and out of incarceration and had recently been released. Good thing he's going backit's probably safer for him on the inside anyways.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  A new study by MIT researchers suggests that the Sahara desert may have once flourished with nature.Their analysis of marine sediment from the West African coast suggests that the Sahara's climate alters between dry and wet every 20,000 years. The researchers believe this "climatic pendulum" is caused by changes to Earth's axis as it rotates around the sun.This in turn affects the amount of sunlight the Earth receives during different seasons.As the planet tilts to receive maximum sunlight, it intensifies periods of monsoon rain which results in a "greener" Sahara. When the Earth tilts toward an angle that doesn't allow it to receive as much sunlight, the Sahara gets a more arid climate.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[AUGSBURG UNIVERSITY, MINNESOTA  A new study by the University of Augsburg in Minnesota claims men prefer women with blonde hair to women with other hair colors.According to the study, male participants found blonde-haired women to look "significantly" younger and healthier than those with a darker hair shade.A total of 110 participants were shown images of women with different hair colors and asked to rate them. Women were rated based on their estimated age, health, attractiveness, relationship potential and parenting potential.The study, published in the Journal of Social Psychology, suggests that the men observed found women with blonde hair to be more attractive and "dateable."However, blondes were also seen as more "promiscuous." Interestingly,the male participants chose women with darker hair shades for the "wife material" category.The researchers also asked about the length of a woman's hair. Apparently the results show that men tend to prefer women with medium-length hair.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[DEVON, UNITED KINGDOM  An enormous fatberg measuring 210 feet (64 meters) has been found clogging a sewer in the seaside town of Sidmouth. Fatbergs are lovely, gigantic congealed masses of fat, wet wipes, grease and other things you're clearly not supposed to flush down the toilet.  According to the BBC, South West Water said the fatberg was the biggest one they've ever had the pleasure of discovering. They said it would take them about eight weeks to remove.South West Water officials said they were glad the fatberg was discovered "in good time" with "no risk" to the quality of ocean water.   The company said that it is very unlikely that the fatberg would cause people's loos to back up. Sewer workers first found the fatberg in December. They won't know the exact size and weight until they start to painstakingly pull it out.A massive 820 foot-long fatberg weighing in at a whopping 130 tonnes was found blocking a east London sewer back in 2017 which took nine weeks to remove.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  NASA plans to test out its first-ever planetary defense mission developed to protect Earth from a possible collision with an asteroid.NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, is the first planetary defense mission in history. Its main objective is to demonstrate a kinetic impact on an asteroid.According to NASA, DART's target is a 150-meter moonlet called Didymos B, a small satellite orbiting a larger near-Earth asteroid called Didymos."The asteroid binary is located roughly 11 million kilometers from Earth. The spacecraft will be guided by an onboard camera and an autonomous real-time navigation system. DART will crash against the moonlet at a speed of roughly 6 kilometers per second. Its objective is to change the speed and direction of the incoming object.The spacecraft is scheduled to launch in June 2021 and expected to hit the asteroid by October 2022.In 2013 a small 18-meter-wide meteor crashed into the Earth's atmosphere and entered over Chelyabinsk, Russia, creating a shockwave that hit six cities across the country.According to NASA, this event is proof of the importance of carrying out preventive planetary defense missions in space.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is missing oral arguments as she recovers at home from lung surgery.  According to Chief Justice John Roberts, Ginsburg did not attend oral arguments, but will participate in the cases and rulings by using the briefs and oral arguments, Reuters reported. Ginsburg underwent a pulmonary lobectomy on Dec. 21 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to remove two cancerous nodules in her left lung and was released from the hospital on Christmas Day. According to Health, the procedure removes one-half to one-third of the lung. The lung tissue removed does not regenerate, but the upper portion of the lungs helps to compensate. According to Raja Flores, MD, chair of thoracic surgery for Mount Sinai Health System and director of the thoracic surgical oncology program at the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai taking to Health, it can take patients anywhere from a few weeks to three months to recover from a pulmonary lobectomy. Patients are trained practice deep breathing and coughing exercises to help the lungs re-expand post-operation. Some may also need additional oxygen while recovering in the hospital.This was Ginsburg's third cancer diagnosis. She broke three ribs in a November fall, which led physicians to discover the cancer in her lung. According to a statement from the Supreme Court, there is currently no signs of any cancer in Ginsburg's body and that no further treatment is needed at this time.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MURICA   Looks like Trump's wall could cause great damage to the plants and wildlife.According to a study from Stanford University published in the journal BioScience, the construction of a border wall between the US and Mexico could have serious consequences for the wildlife and environment surrounding the area.The US-Mexico border crosses through six eco-regions. These areas are home to diverse flora and fauna including 62 species tagged as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.The wall will mainly degrade landscape connectivity, preventing species from reaching resources, mates and affecting migration. The report states that the wall would disconnect 346 species from half of their habitat including the endangered Peninsular bighorn sheep, the Sonoran pronghorn and the Mexican gray wolf.According to a report from the Center for Biological Diversity, the population of Mexican gray wolves is critically endangered growing by only four wolves from 2014 to 2017.Apart from affecting wildlife, the wall will also affect the flow of three major rivers: the Rio Grande, Colorado, and Tijuana Rivers.This also affects between 100 and 500 rivers and streams connected to them.A study by the University of Texas at Austin released in July last year reported that the wall could threaten the Tamaulipan thornscrub ecosystem, the endangered wildflower Zapata bladderpod, and the threatened whiskerbush cactus.Researchers from this study suggest alternatives that could allow for wildlife movements such as wildlife crossings and electronic sensors.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA['MURICA  In 2016 the world saw one of the most unique U.S. presidential elections in history, along with the rise of the resulting winner's most favorite term: "Fake News."And now, a new study published in the journal Science Advances has examined the role 'fake news', aka misinformation, played during said election.The study defined fake news as 'misleading content created largely for the purpose of generating ad revenue'. Researchers created a list of fake news sources using existing information gathered by journalists and academics. The team looked at a month of Facebook activity of 8,763 Americans and the results were quite interesting.  The study found that, contrary to popular belief, sharing fake news during the presidential elections was actually not that common. The study says over 90 percent of participants did not share information from fake news sources.However, the rest who did share fake news are said to have belonged to the baby boomer demographic. That's folk in their 50s, 60s and 70s. Among those who shared fake news, 18.1 percent were Republican and 3.5 percent were Democrats.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CALIFORNIA  Conservation groups have reported an 86 percent decline in the populations of the iconic monarch butterfly in California.Data from an invertebrate animal conservation group called Xerces Society revealed that counts of overwintering monarch butterflies found in California had plummeted from 148,000 in 2017 to just 20,456 in a year.According to research published in the Biological Conservation journal, monarch butterflies have a 72 percent risk of becoming extinct in 20 years.Several factors contribute to the dramatic decrease in monarch butterfly populations including habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change.According to National Geographic, rising levels of carbon dioxide may be contaminating milkweed  a flowering plant that is the sole food source of the monarch caterpillar.Increasing temperatures may also affect the monarch butterfly's migration route, pushing butterflies to travel further up north and affecting summer breeding areas.Xerces Society is encouraging people to help restore the monarch butterfly population by planting nectar sources and milkweed and reducing pesticide use.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MOMBASA, KENYA  The Daily Nation reports that the Kenyan government might lose its prized port to China if it defaults on its billion-dollar debt.Kenya currently owes China $9.8 billion. The government borrowed the money to fund the Standard Gauge Railway between Nairobi and Mombasa, as well as other national infrastructure.A report from the auditor-general to Kenya Ports Authority revealed that the port's assets were used as collateral to secure the loans from China's Exim bank. Under the loan agreement, Kenya's prized Mombasa port would not have state immunity, which means Chinese lenders can seize it if the country can't pay its debt.The audit report notes that "the agreement is biased, since any non-performance or dispute with the China Exim bank would be referred to arbitration in China." And let's face it, China only looks out for numero uno.The prospective Chinese takeover sparked alarm and outrage among Kenyans. But President Uhuru Kenyatta called the report propaganda, according to The Star, and claimed the country is ahead of its payment schedule, with no cause for alarm.The South China Morning Post reports that the incident highlights the risks of participating in Beijing's "Belt and Road" project, which aims to connect trade between Asia, Africa, and Europe with infrastructure built and paid for by China.But China has been accused of practicing debt trap diplomacy.  According to the Center for Global Development, huge loans are given to countries that will be unable to repay, forcing them to surrender assets and territory when the loans default.Credit rating agency Moody's previously warned that nations rich in natural resources or with key infrastructure are vulnerable to the risk of losing control of their valuable assets.One such country was Sri Lanka, which in 2017 lost Hambantota Port to China for a lease period of 99 years, after struggling to repay its loans. Zambia also lost its international airport to Beijing over debt repayment in 2018, according to Daily Nation.China's acquisition of assets, especially ports, have led analysts such as Brahma Chellaney from New Delhi's Centre for Policy Research to speculate that the actual aim is to create a network of naval bases via Belt and Road trade routes.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MAIPO, CHILE   Looks like another one bites the dust thanks to humankind.A once beautiful lagoon near Santiago, Chile has completely dried up for the first time in 2,000 years. The cause? You guessed it. Humans.Chile's Aculeo lagoon, a body of water that used to cover 12 square kilometers located in Paine, Chile, has completely dried up for the first time in 2,000 years.According to researchers from the University of Chile, the disappearance of the body of water is due to urban and agricultural expansion as well as climate change and severe droughts.Data from Chile's National Statistics Institute shows that Paine's population has increased by 45 percent from 2002 to 2017.These communities have depleted the lagoon's water by building deep wells and extracting underground water from the aquifer.Also, agricultural activities in the area consisting mainly of fruit plantations have extracted underground water and water directly from the lagoon 24 hours a day at a rate of up to 16 liters per minute.Pablo Garcia, a lead researcher from University of Chile said to Chilean newspaper Publimetro, "There was no territorial planning here, the municipality authorized the use of the land without considering whether there was enough water to sustain it."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ST. LOUIS  A new study has linked poor quality sleep to higher levels of a brain protein believed to cause Alzheimer's.Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine studied the link between tau and sleep levels by recruiting 119 people over 60, most of whom were cognitively healthy.According to the study published in Science Translational Medicine, subjects' sleep patterns were monitored for a week using portable EEG monitors and wristwatch-like sensors.Tau and amyloid beta levels were also measured using either PET brain scans or spinal fluid sampling.The results show that those who had fewer hours of slow-wave sleep had higher volumes of the tau protein in their brain.Slow-wave sleep is the deepest phase of non-rapid eye movement sleep. This stage of the sleep cycle is also thought to be important for memory consolidation.According to study author Brendan Lucey, those who showed increased tau pathology slept more at night and napped during the day, but were not getting good quality sleep.While the findings are significant, the study is unclear on whether poor quality sleep is a cause or consequence of pathological changes in the brain.Researchers suggest, however, that sleep disruptions may be an effective tool for doctors to spot patients in the earliest stages of cognitive decline.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[AYODHYA, INDIA  The Indian Supreme Court is expected to hear the controversial Ayodhya case on Jan 29.The case concerns a highly contentious plan to build a Hindu temple on the ruins of a mosque from the Mughal era. The site has been disputed between Hindus and Muslims ever since it was built in the 16th Century.Supporters of the current government are pushing for a temple of the hindu god Ram to be built in place of the ruins of Babri Masjid, especially since elections are to take place in May, Reuters reports. This was one of the key promises Prime Minister Narendra Modi made during his previous election campaign, according to BBC News.Babri Masjid was built in the city of Ayodhya during the Mughal era. Hindu mobs tore it down in 1992. This triggered communal riots in the country and killed around 2,000 people. Today the site is in ruins, with a tiny makeshift Ram temple in its place.Hindus claim the mosque was built on the site of the birthplace of Lord Ram. However, several Hindu nationalists want to build a fully fledged temple of Ram in its place.The Allahabad High Court previously ruled that the land should be divided in three parts, reported the Times of India.  One for the Hindu deity, one for a Hindu-nationalist group and one for the Sunni Waqf Board.

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[PORTLAND  Professor Peter Boghossian says Portland State University has begun disciplinary proceedings against him for writing a whole mess of hilarious hoax papers.According to the Willamette Week, Boghossian and two other colleagues submitted more than two dozen satirical papers to feminist theory and race-studies journals in an attempt to expose how easily it was to get published in legitimate peer-reviewed academic papers. Boghossian's papers claimed to look at things like the rate at which Portlanders interrupted dogs getting it on at the park. They were meant to mock gender studies, race studies and feminist theory by showing how the top journals in those fields had extremely low standards for publication. Seven of the fake papers were accepted by actual journals and four were published online. Well, now his university is upset and wants to get him fired because of all the heat and attention the papers have brought to PSU. What do you think? Should Boghossian get fired or tenure?]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[FLAT EARTH  Pack your bags because a few good Flat Earthers have announced a flat out massive cruise in 2020, according to the Guardian.  The Flat Earth International Conference is billing it as their "biggest, boldest, best adventure yet." Those lucky enough to take part in the trip of a lifetime will get to indulge themselves at typical cruise ship restaurants, catch rays shining down on Flat Earth by the pool and maybe catch some artificial surf waves. The only problem for the Non-Rounders is what navigational charts will they be using for their bold adventure? Nautical charts are designed under the round Earth myth. Also maybe don't tell the spherically-challenged that the "G" in GPS stands for global. And just like with any other rigid and thorough scientific discipline, those within the Flat Earth community have different theories, but the core belief is usually that the Earth is flat.That isunless you can sink your teeth into the Dunkin Donuts school of thought which believes we are actually on a massive donut-shaped planet.  But back to the bigliest, boldliest cruise of the century. Where are they planning to set sail? Our suggestion would be to travel all the way to the edge of this planetary pita. Flat Earthers might want to move quickly too, because who knows how much longer the ice wall barrier holding the oceans in will be there, especially with global warming and all.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LONDON  The South China Morning Post reports that the UK's foreign and defense ministers have said Britain is planning to establish a permanent naval base in Southeast Asia.The location of the base will likely be in Brunei, although Singapore is also being considered.According to an opinion piece in the Washington Examiner, establishing a naval base in Brunei would allow the UK to support the Americans in "corralling Chinese forces" by limiting their movement and offering force replenishment.They can also provide strike power by deploying Astute-class submarines at the base. Powerful torpedos and a high-capability sonar system allows the submarines to "complement U.S. Virginia-class counterparts in threatening the enemy while unseen."Brunei is already host to a British Army base, where an infantry battalion of Royal Gurkha Rifles are stationed, along with an Army Air Corps Flight of Bell 212 helicopters.The Asia Times reports that according to a British Ministry of Defence document, a Franco-British carrier strike group may also be deployed in the early 2020s. The UK's HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, and France's Charles de Gaulle will rotate as the formation's primary warship.The move is set to complement Washington's strategy of asserting freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in the South China Sea. But Beijing will likely see it as a threat, especially since the country claims the entire South China Sea as its own, and has militarized several disputed islands in the region.Tensions between Beijing and London were inflamed after a British warship sailed close to the Paracels in September  a gesture regarded by China as hostile.The planned base has already been called 'muscle-flexing' by one Chinese professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. But support for the U.S. aside, Britain may have other reasons for pushing its plan.According to CNN, a naval base in Asia may also serve as a 'showroom' for military hardware and could result in big arms deals that would benefit the UK's post-Brexit economy.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BALTIMORE, MARYLAND   A team from the University of Maryland Baltimore County is the first to determine the annual migratory cycle of the green darner dragonfly.According to the paper published in the journal Biology Letters, researchers employed stable-hydrogen isotope analysis on wing samples of more than 800 dragonflies from eight different countries spanning 140 years. The wings analyzed were from specimens caught in the wild and from specimens preserved in museums.The researchers found it takes three generations of green darners to complete an annual migratory cycle.The first migration occurs between February and March. Dragonflies depart from southern United States, Mexico and the Caribbean by May they reach the upper Midwest. The first generation lays its eggs there and dies.Dragonflies from the second generation head South again once they reach maturity and deposits another batch of eggs when they arrive at their destination.The third and last generation does not migrate but produces another batch of eggs that will restart the cycle once again the following spring.Researchers have not yet understood how migratory insects know what path to take during their migration cycles. Although climate change may pose a threat to this natural process.Researchers participating in the study stated, “further research is needed to determine how a changing climate may alter the migratory schedules and annual cycle of dragonflies and other migratory insects.”  SOURCES:https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0741https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/dragonfly-undertakes-epic-multi-generational-migration-each-year-180971190/]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[GERMANY / RUSSIA  Russia and Germany plan to build an energy pipeline that will bypass Ukraine, according to DW. The pipeline, named "Nord Stream 2", will be 1,200 kilometers long. It is planned to connect Europe to natural gas reserves in northern Russia, according to offshoretechnology.com.The project is being led by Russia and is expected to bypass Ukraine and run under the Baltic Sea. DW reports Germany and Russia both want to expand the pipeline from the existing Nord Stream 1. Both nations also want to double its current capacity.According to RT, the pipeline will carry natural gas from Russia to Europe and could provide up to 70 percent of Europe's gas needs.SOURCES: RT, DW, Nord-Stream 2 website, Off Shore Technology, Reuters,https://www.rt.com/business/448369-us-threatens-nord-stream-partners/https://www.dw.com/en/nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline-what-is-the-controversy-about/a-44677741https://www.nord-stream2.com/https://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/nord-stream-2-pipeline/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-russia-pipeline/us-sanctions-against-nord-stream-2-wrong-solution-germanys-maas-idUSKCN1P42IH]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[EUREKA SPRINGS, ARKANSAS  Kenny is said to "the world's ugliest tiger", reports The Sun, and is one example of why they should not be bred.Kenny's short snout, abnormal underbite, eye placement and white fur are all results of cruel inbreeding. He was born in 1998 on a tiger farm, he and his cross-eyed brother Willie are the only two cubs that were not stillborn or who died at birth. According to The Sun, Kenny, Willie and their parents, Loretta and Conway were taken away from their breeder after he contacted The Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge. The man claimed that Kenny's snout looked that way because the tiger used to hit its head against the wall constantly. He was asking for roughly $10,000 USD each for Kenny and Willie. But, the Refuge wouldn't pay. Kenny died at age 10. Regular tigers can live up to 18 years in captivity.Currently, white tiger cubs can be sold for up to $5,000 USD each. Their skin and fur are turned into rugs while their body parts are sold to make health potions.According to animal news website, The Dodo, white tigers are most likely all descendants from a single male that was stolen from its mother as a cub for breeding.Big Cat Rescue, a sanctuary dedicated to protecting large felines, explains that white tigers are born only through inbreeding via brother to sister or father to daughter. The sanctuary says this level of inbreeding can cause severe mutations.A gene mutation makes all white tigers cross-eyed. Depending on the cat, sometimes this can be seen and on others, it cannot. They can also be born with cleft palates, club feet, spinal deformities, and deficient organs.These gene mutations do not only affect white tigers. They are also prevalent in other big cat mixes such as ligers. That's a female tiger, and a male lion mix, and tigons, that's a female lion and male tiger mix.SOURCES: Big Cat Rescue, The Dodo, The Sun, PETAhttps://bigcatrescue.org/why-white-tigers-should-go-extinct-2/https://www.thedodo.com/truth-about-white-tiger-breeding-1492535969.htmlhttps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7959952/kenny-inbred-tiger/https://www.peta.org/blog/ligers-tigons-frankencats-shouldnt-bred/]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  According to NBC News, last week when Los Angeles police discovered Timothy Dean dead in the apartment of Democratic activist and political donor Ed Buck, Jasmyne Cannick was not shocked. Six months ago over Twitter, Cannick had posted a warning about Buck. "If another young, Black gay man overdoses or worse dies at Democratic donor Ed Buck's apartment it's going to be the fault of the sheriff's dept and L.A. District Atty for not stopping him when they had the opportunity to," she tweeted in July. In July 2017, 26-year-old black male Gemmel Moore died from a meth overdose at Buck's apartment. After doing some digging, Cannick found Moore's journal that said Buck got him hooked on crystal and forced him to use it against his will. Cannick has since collected a bunch of information showing Buck preys on poor black men by asking them over to his place to slam speed with injections. She has published all the accounts from men who said they went to Buck's apartment for paid booty calls and drugs on her personal website.  The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed Thursday that homicide is currently investigating TImothy Dean's death. Several Democrats have given back donations from Buck, including U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu and former state Senator Kevin de Leon.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HONG KONG  According to the AFP, Hong Kong announced a proposed law to punish anyone who disrespects the Chinese national anthem with up to three years behind bars.  The bill will have its first reading in the city's parliament on January 23, but with the CCP in essence controlling parliament, passage into "law" is all but assured. Apparently, Hong Kong has been thinking about the law ever since it tweaked legislation on the proper way and place to sing the anthem. Rules already prohibit people from playing the greatest anthem in the history of anthems at parties, weddings and funerals. Why on earth would you want to hear that at any of those occasions? The soon-to-be law will copy the rest of China by upping the maximum prison sentence to three years for "serious" disrespect. If they really respected the anthem they would make it five years. The draft forbids playing the anthem "in a distorted or disrespectful way, with intent to insult." It's also a big no no to change the lyrics or tune.Messing with the anthem could also set Hong Kongers back $6380 bones in fines.  Secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs Patrick Nip said the law would "preserve the dignity of the national anthem and promote respect." Spoken like a true CCP speakerbox. Maybe the commies should just outlaw any thoughts remotely disrespectful to anything loosely pertaining to China.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NEWTON, MASSACHUSETTS / BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA  Certain types of dental floss may increase the amount of toxic chemicals present in the body, according to a new study published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology.Researchers in the study, led by the Silent Spring Institute in collaboration with the Public Health Institute in Berkeley, California, tested for the presence of PFAS in six different dental flosses.To do this, the researchers examined the blood samples of 178 middle-aged female participants.The study found that women who flossed using Oral-B Glide had higher levels of PFAS, or polyfluoroalkyl substances, present in the body than women who used other brands of floss.In a statement to USA Today, Oral-B said they didn't find the toxic chemical in their floss and said their dental floss "undergoes thorough safety testing."The company added: "The safety of the people who use our products is our top priority."PFAS are typically found in food packaging, cleaning products and drinking water, according to the EPA.This is the first study to link dental floss to PFAS, according to the study.PFAS could build up over time and may cause health problems. PFAS has previously been linked to thyroid disease, high cholesterol and decreased fertility, according to the EPA.SOURCES: Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, EPA, USA Today, Silent Spring Institutehttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-018-0109-yhttps://www.epa.gov/pfas/basic-information-pfashttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/01/09/oral-b-glide-floss-toxic-pfas-chemicals-study/2530661002/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-01/ssi-dfa010819.php]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA  The Guardian reports that Google shareholder James Martin filed a suit against Alphabet Inc. Thursday accusing it of handing out massive payouts to company executives accused of sexual misconduct.According to court documents, the shareholder is accusing the company of breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of power, and corporate wasteThe suit asks the company to add at least three independent directors to its board, seeks damages for the exit payments given to Google executives, and changes to Alphabet's corporate governance and shareholder management.It also includes a proposal to eliminate non-disclosure agreements within the company to encourage employees to report sexual misconduct without fear of repercussion.According to the New York Times, Google paid Android creator Andy Rubin a $90 million exit payment in 2014 after Rubin quietly resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment.But Rubin is not the only Google exec under scrutiny.In February 2017, former Head of Google Search, Amit Singhal, was asked to step down from his position as Uber vice president after he failed to disclose he had left Google due to "credible" sexual harassment allegations made against him. In 2011, current Alphabet chief legal officer and Google exec, David Drummond, reportedly earned $190 million from stock options and awards after reports that he had an affair with an employee surfaced. Said employee later claimed she was pushed out of the company.These are hardly the first sexual harassment allegations to surface involving Silicon Valley tech companies.According to the BBC, in August 2018, ride-sharing company Uber paid $34,000 to 56 current and ex-employees following sexual harassment claims that surfaced in 2017.In 2017, 500 Startups founding partner Dave McClure was accused of sexual assault and inappropriate sexual misconduct. He has since resigned from the company.SOURCES:https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/10/google-sexual-harassment-shareholder-lawsuit-alphabethttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.htmlhttps://qz.com/india/920713/the-rise-and-fall-of-amit-singhal-the-former-google-star-just-fired-by-uber/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.htmlhttps://www.bbc.com/news/business-45266954https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45266954https://www.axios.com/google-memo-outcry-is-about-something-bigger-1513304723-617934e7-206a-4106-a49e-dfc38555bebd.html]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CHINA  According to the failing New York Times, Chinese police have started questioning and detaining an increasing number of Twitter users even though the service is blocked in China and almost no one uses it.Apparently the world's worst INTRANET isn't quite restrictive enough, so Xi Jinping and his goons are cracking down even more. Chinese Twitter users are increasingly getting harassed by annoying Chinese police in painfully long and boring interrogation where typical CCP threats are made to them and their families.  Po po usually start by demanding you delete certain tweets, which express things like an opinion. Other times to thought police just ask you to delete your entire account. And if you refuse? Well, then they just get their government hackers to access your account and delete it for you. Wowhow thoughtful of the regime. In other instances, Twitter users have actually been chained to things in the interrogation rooms while authorities show them printouts of their no no tweets. China has around 800 million INTRANET users, not internet users. According to a study by the Hertie School of Governance in Germany, only 0.4 percent or around 3.2 million Chinese have Twitter access.  However, while Chinese citizens are banned from using Twitter, Communist Party affiliated propaganda outlets like the People's Daily and Xinhua news agency use the social media service regularly to help spread their b.s. worldwide. Ah...hypocrisy, one of China's oldest and tastiest dishes.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MADRID  People who sleep less than six hours a night might have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those who sleep seven to eight hours, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.  According to UPI, the study published on Jan. 14 found that chronic lack of sleep or poor sleep quality were associated with increased chances of atherosclerosis, a condition where fatty plaque accumulates in the arteries which can lead to heart attack or stroke. For the study, lead researcher Jose Ordovas from the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid and his team tracked around 4,000 Spanish adults using coronary ultrasound and CT scans to monitor artery health. Participants did not have a prior history of heart disease at the start of the study and had an average age of 46. Researchers was unable to prove cause and effect, but they found people who slept less than six hours a night were 27 percent more likely to have body-wide atherosclerosis than those who slept seven to eight hours a night. The study also found that women who slept more than eight hours a night had an increased chance of atherosclerosis. Adults with poor-quality sleep were also 34 percent more likely to have atherosclerosis, compared to individuals with good-quality sleep.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BOCA CHICA VILLAGE, TEXAS  Elon Musk has revealed images on his Twitter account of a prototype space vehicle, the Starship.Last December he revealed that the Starship would be made of stainless steel instead of carbon fiber. The spacecraft is designed for space travel, space station missions, and lunar expeditions.Last Thursday SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared new images of the Starship.According to the images shared on Musk's Twitter account last Thursday, the Starship prototype, called Starship Hopper, has a shiny steel finish with a nine-meter tank diameter. Musk also mentioned that the prototype will be used in suborbital vertical take-off and landing tests, also known as suborbital "hops". The first orbital prototype is scheduled to be finished by June this year. The orbital version of the Starship will be launched with a giant rocket called the Super Heavy Rocket and will have the capacity to carry up to 100 passengers.  Musk said this version will have "thicker skins that will not wrinkle and a smoothly curving nose section." The final version of the Starship and Super heavy Rocket will also carry out long-distance travel around Earth. According to SpaceX, it will take them only 25 minutes to travel from Los Angeles to New York and less than 40 minutes to complete a flight from London to Hong Kong. Flights on those routes last 5 and a half hours and almost twelve hours respectively.SpaceX hopes to launch a manned mission to Mars as soon as 2024. Japanese billionaire, Yusaku Maezawa, is the company's first private customer. According to The Verge, Maezawa made a down payment to buy all the seats for the ship's first ride. He plans to invite artists from different fields in hopes to inspire them to create original art once they are back from the epic journey.SOURCES:Space.com, Twitter, SpaceX, The Vergehttps://www.space.com/42979-spacex-starship-test-vehicle-photo.htmlhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthorhttps://www.spacex.com/marshttps://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869990/elon-musk-spacex-lunar-mission-ticket-moon-passenger-bfr-falcon-yusaku-maezawa]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ORLANDO, FLORIDA  Scientists are building a space probe that could extract water from asteroids and travel indefinitely in space.Researchers from the University of Central Florida have developed a spacecraft that could generate steam for propulsion by extracting water from asteroids or other planets.The project is a collaboration between NASA, the University of Central Florida and Honey Bee Robotics, according to the University of Central Florida's news release.The spacecraft is called the World Is Not Enough, or WINE, and would be the size of a microwave oven.The probe would extract water from other terrestrial planets and use deployable solar panels to create enough energy to generate steam.The space probe would then be able to visit places with low gravity and water such as the Moon, Pluto and Europa to refuel and mine.Theoretically speaking, the space probe could go on to explore space "forever," the press release states, as long as it doesn't run out of fuel.In the university's news release, Phil Metzger, UCF's planetary research scientist said: "WINE was designed to never run out of propellant so [that] exploration will be less expensive."The team is currently seeking partners to continue creating the space probe.SOURCES: University of Central Florida News release, New Atlashttps://today.ucf.edu/steam-powered-asteroid-hoppers-developed-ucf-collaboration/https://newatlas.com/steam-powered-space-probes/58015/]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[#Canada #China #HuaweiDALIAN, CHINA  China has sentenced a Canadian man to death following the arrest of Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver, reports the South China Morning Post.`Robert Lloyd Schellenger was arrested in 2014 after being accused of trying to smuggle 227 kilograms of methamphetamines from China to Australia.In November 2018, Schellenger was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $22,000 USD. China ordered a retrial of his case in December, just weeks after Meng's arrest.They invited a group of foreign press to witness the trial in which the Canadian national was ultimately sentenced to death amid claims that his current sentence was too lenient.Schellenger says he was framed by criminals introduced to him by a man called Xu Qing. Xu Qing was present in the trial as one of the prosecutor's witnesses.During Xu Qing's testimony in court, he claimed he could not recall information regarding the case and when he spoke he referred to a written statement for details. The deliberation for the case took roughly an hour. Schellenberg's lawyer told the South China Morning Post that, "The announcement of the sentencing was all very fast, it took around 20 minutes." Canadian officials believe this sentencing and the detention of two other Canadian citizens in December are retaliation from the Chinese government for the arrest of the  Huawei CFO.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government viewed the situation with extreme concern. He said, "China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply death penalty as in this case facing a Canadian."

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LAYTON, UTAH  A Utah teen took an internet meme way too far and may face charges after she crashed into another car while driving blindfolded, local CBS affiliate KUTV reports.The 17-year-old was driving with a 16-year-old passenger when the two dinguses decided to try out the "Bird Box challenge," KUTV reports.The social media challenge is based on the popular Netflix horror film Bird Box, in which Sandra Bullock must wear a blindfold to avoid seeing a scary monster.It has become an internet meme as people film themselves while attempting to perform various tasks blindfolded.In this case, the 17-year-old apparently decided to use her beanie to cover her eyes as she drove her pickup truck in Layton, Utah.She overcorrected and careened into oncoming traffic, hitting another car before skidding into a light pole and finally hitting a sound wall, KUTV reports.In a Twitter post, Layton police shared photos of the totaled vehicles, writing: "Bird Box Challenge while driving ... predictable result.""This happened on Monday as a result of the driver covering her eyes while driving on Layton Parkway. Luckily no injuries."Netflix also posted a message on Twitter, which read: "Can't believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE.""We don't know how this started, and we appreciate the love, but Boy and Girl have just one wish for 2019 and it is that you not end up in the hospital due to memes."The teen could be charged with reckless driving, KUTV reports.Speaking to KSL TV, Layton police Lieutenant Travis Lyman said: "Honestly, I'm almost embarrassed to have to say, 'Don't drive with your eyes covered,' but you know apparently we do have to say that.""The stakes are just so high and it's just such a potentially dangerous thing as it is: to try and do it in that way is inexcusable. It really puts everybody at risk."

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CALIFORNIA  The U.S. Supreme court has rejected a challenge to California's 2004 ban on foie gras, the Los Angeles Times reports.Foie gras was outlawed in California after animals rights groups fought for a ban on the french delicacy, the New York Times reports. Even though foie gras was banned in 2004, full enforcement of the ban only started in 2012. Legal challenges resulted in it being suspended and reinstated numerous times over the past six years in California, according to SFGate.Now, it is illegal to sell or produce foie gras in California as the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case against the ban.Violators of the ban will be fined up to US$1,000 if they are caught selling foie gras.To make foie gras, a metal tube is forced down the throat of a duck or a goose to enable forced feeding. This process is called "gavage," according to One Green Planet.org.The animals are then force-fed grain until their liver fattens to 10 times its size. The animals are eventually then slaughtered and their liver is cooked into a pate.The Animal Legal Defense Fund's staff attorney Kelsey Eberly told SFGate that they were "absolutely thrilled" at the Supreme Court's decision to not hear the case against the ban.SOURCES: Inhabitat, LA Times, One Green Planet, Tree Hugger, SF Gate, https://inhabitat.com/foie-gras-ban-in-california-stands-after-court-battle/https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-re-foie-gras-ban-20190114-story.htmlhttps://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/foie-gras-ban-in-california-upheld-by-supreme-court/https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/foie-gras-ban-made-official-california.htmlhttps://www.sfgate.com/food/article/California-s-foie-gras-ban-upheld-though-chefs-13514763.php]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[#RahafMohammed #Canada CANADA  Canada granted asylum to Rahaf Mohammed, a Saudi teenager, last week after she escaped her family, CBS News reports.Reporting from a press conference Rahaf was speaking at, CNN quotes her as saying,"I am one of the lucky ones. I know there are unlucky women who disappeared after trying to escape, or who could not do anything to change their reality."In an interview with CBC News, Rahaf explained how she was physically and mentally abused by her family since age 16.She was born Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun[c][d]. She dropped her surname after her family disowned her.Rahaf planned to escape when she turned 18, as she would be considered a legal adult by then. She explained she would not be allowed to travel by herself in Saudi Arabia.  So Rahaf persuaded her parents to take her with them on a vacation to Kuwait where would be able to travel by herself.This is when she planned to escape. Rahaf said she left the hotel early one night while her family were asleep and bought a one-way ticket to Thailand. However, authorities in Bangkok stopped her at the airport and seized her passport. Rahaf then barricaded herself in an airport hotel room to avoid being sent back to her family, CNN reports.She also turned to Twitter for help. The resulting tweets went viral and sparked international outrage. And eventually, Thai officials decided not to send Rahaf back. Instead, they let her remain in Bangkok under the protection of the United Nations, CBC News reports.On Twitter, Rahaf asked for help from various countries to grant her asylum. That's when Canada stepped in last Friday, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying Canada would grant asylum to Rahaf, France 24 reports.In a Twitter post, Rahaf said she wants to thank the public for saving her life and supporting her. She also added she looks forward to life in Canada.SOURCES: CNN, France 24, CBC News, Twitter / Rahaf Mohammed, https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/15/americas/saudi-teen-asylum-intl/index.htmlhttps://www.france24.com/en/20190115-canada-saudi-arabia-teen-asylum-win-trudeau-refugee-rahaf-mohammed-al-qunun-diplomacyhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saudi-teen-fled-thailand-canada-1.4977664https://twitter.com/rahaf84427714/media]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MALAGA, SPAIN  According to El Pais, rescuers are still searching for a toddler who fell down a well in southern Spain.Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, two-year-old Yulen walked away from his family while playing in a mountainous area in Malaga, Spain, and fell down a narrow well. The family heard his cries shortly after the fall, but have not heard or seen anything since.The hole is only 10 inches wide, too narrow to fit an adult. But it is believed to be 328 feet deep. It was bored in December during water prospection works, and left uncovered.Rescuers lowered a camera into the well and found the bag of sweets and cup he was holding in a layer of compacted wet sand about 250 feet down.According to the Mirror, emergency services have yet to locate the boy and fear he may be beneath the sand.The spokesman for the Civil Guard told Spanish broadcaster TVE that efforts are being made to widen the well while also digging a separate shaft to try and connect to it. A third alternative is an excavation from the side of the mountain.Elias Bendodo, who is president of the Provincial Council of Malaga, said rescuers will not stop until they find the toddler.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ATLANTA  A Georgia man was charged on Wednesday with plotting a terrorist attack on the White House, according to the Washington Post. Hasher Jallal Taheb, 21, is accused of attempting to damage or destroy the White House by means of fire or an explosive, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, reports the Washington Post. According to the complaint, the FBI started investigating Taheb in March after an unidentified citizen informed authorities that he had "become radicalized." According to court papers, an FBI informant and an undercover FBI agent then befriended Taheb, and through conversations, the suspect told them his plan to "blow a hole in the White House" so the three could carry out an attack with guns and grenades. On Wednesday, Taheb, the informant and the undercover agent met in a Buford, Georgia parking lot to exchange their cars for guns, an antitank weapon and explosives, according to the criminal complaint. According to officials, the weapons were all rendered inert as part of the sting operation. Taheb was arrested after the transaction was completed.  According to the Washington Post, it is unclear if Taheb has obtained a lawyer.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ANTARCTICA  New research sheds a light on how much ice exactly has melted in the past decades and what is causing the current rise in global sea levels, reports Phys.org.According to a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Antarctica has been losing six times more ice mass annually than 40 years ago due to climate-induced melting. This rapid rate of melting has increased global sea levels by more than half an inch.The forty-year long research was conducted by glaciologists from the University of California, Irvine, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Netherlands' Utrecht University who studied 18 regions in Antarctica including 176 basins and neighboring islands from 1979 to 2017.The team found that the ice continent had shed 40 gigatons of mass annually from 1979 to 1990. The rate of loss increased six-fold to 252 gigatons per year between 2009 to 2017.The team gathered data by analyzing aerial images taken by NASA's Operation IceBridge, observing satellite radar interferometry from multiple space agencies and studying Landsat satellite imagery series which have been ongoing since the 1970s.Another study published in the journal Nature GeoScience revealed that variations in Earth's axial tilt, known as obliquity, affect the rise and fall of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.  That team also discovered a thin frozen layer of ocean water that surrounds Antarctica, known as sea ice, is vital in order to protect large portions of the continent's underwater ice from warmer waters.Currently, sea ice levels in Antarctica are at their lowest since measurements started being recorded in 1979. Scientists warn that increasing levels of human-generated carbon dioxide could threaten the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and dangerously elevate global sea levels.SOURCES:Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature GeoScience, Phys.org, Science Directhttps://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/01/08/1812883116https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0284-4https://phys.org/news/2019-01-antarctica-ice-mass-annually-years.htmlhttps://phys.org/news/2019-01-antarctic-ice-sheet-one-two-climate.htmlhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190114161150.htm]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CARY, NORTH CAROLINA  Fortnite was alerted to a major flaw in their security system last November that was letting hackers into players' accounts undetected, reports CNET.The flaw left gamers at the mercy of hackers capable of accessing and controlling their accounts. The cyber-criminals could purchase in-game items using the players' credit cards, and could even pose as players' in in-game chats.According to CNET, Fortnite developer Epic Games was alerted to the shady activity by cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies in November 2018. The flaws were said to be fixed by January. Epic Games advised gamers to secure their accounts by strengthening their passwords, not reusing passwords or sharing account information with others. Solid advice, Epic, but looks like passwords had nothing to do with it.Hackers were accessing the accounts without using login information. In fact, flaws within Epic Game's sub-domains made their job much easier than that. All they had to do was send players a malicious link designed to look like an Epic Games domain. If the player clicked on it, the hacker could then acquire the user's Fortnite authentication token without using any login credentials. The vulnerability flaws were found in Epic Games' web infrastructure and their use of Single Sign-On systems.A Single Sign-On system is a security authentication process that lets a user log into multiple yet independent accounts or applications using only one set of login credentials."Google uses this system to connect a user with all its other applications like YouTube, GoogleMaps, Drive and so on."Oded Vanunu, Check Point's Head of Products Vulnerability Research, recommends players to enable two-factor authentication to better safeguard their personal info.SOURCESVariety, CNET, Check Point Software Technologieshttps://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/massive-fortnite-security-hole-allowed-hackers-to-take-over-accounts-eavesdrop-on-calls-1203109556/https://www.cnet.com/news/fortnite-had-a-security-vulnerability-that-let-hackers-take-over-accounts/https://research.checkpoint.com/hacking-fortnite/]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[XIAMEN, CHINA  In what can only be described as a gift and a curse, a Chinese woman from Xiamen recently woke up one morning unable to hear men's voices. According to Next Shark, the woman identified as Chen by Chinese website QQ went to bed the night before feeling nauseated with ringing in her ears. When she woke up the next day, she was unable to hear her boyfriend speaking to her. Chen then got herself to Qianpu hospital, where and ENT doctor diagnosed her with a condition known as reverse-slope hearing loss, or RSHL, where patients can only hear high-frequency sounds. According to Audiology, Inc., RSHL reportedly affects about 1 in 12,000 people. Only about 3,000 people in the U.S. and Canada have the condition, also known as low-frequency hearing loss. RSHL is usually passed down from your parents, but can be caused by certain illnesses, viral infections or sudden hearing loss. Changes in pressure to inner ear fluid, stress, injury and circulation problems can also contribute to RSHL.   Patients who suffer from RSHL are unable to pick up low-frequency sounds like thunder, refrigerator humming and in this casea boyfriend.  Doctors expect Chen to make a full recovery as long as she reduces her stress and gets enough shuteye.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[GENEVA  Researchers at CERN revealed a conceptual plan for a new particle accelerator called the Future Circular Collider, or FCC.It would be located in Geneva and would have a circumference of roughly 100 kilometers. That's almost four times bigger than the Large Hadron Collider or LHC.The conceptual design report predicts it would take approximately 20 years to design and build the new collider. The report highlights the importance of building it at the right time to ensure the continuation of particle research after the LHC stops operating in 2035.According to the report, the collider would be built in phases. During its early stages, it would collide electrons and positrons. Later it would collide electrons against the nuclei of lead atoms.The team hopes that by 2050 the FCC will be able to carry out proton-proton collisions with an energy of 100 teraelectronvolts[d]. That is seven times the energy capacity of the LHC.Plans for the collider also include a radiofrequency acceleration system, large scale cryogenic plants and 16 tesla high-field accelerator magnets. It took 1,300 scientists based at 150 universities worldwide five years to develop this conceptual project.SOURCES:CERN, Nature, The Guardian, BBC, Phys.org, The Vergehttp://fcc-cdr.web.cern.ch/http://fcc-cdr.web.cern.ch/webkit/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00173-2https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/15/cern-draws-up-plans-for-collider-four-times-the-size-of-large-hadronhttps://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46862486https://phys.org/news/2019-01-cern-vision-next-generation-particle-collider.htmlhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183828/cern-physics-particle-accelerator-hadron-collider]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA  Scientists have used new measurements to calculate the mass of Saturn's rings to estimate their age, which is 10to 100 million years old, according to Berkeley News.  One of the last things the Cassini spacecraft did before plunging into Saturn's atmosphere in 2017 was to travel between the planet and its rings, acting as a gravity probe.  NASA programmed Cassini to perform 22 dives between the planet and the rings, with earth-based radio telescopes measuring the spacecraft's velocity to within a fraction of a millimeter per second. Based on how much Cassini's flight path was deflected by the gravity of the rings, researchers were able to make an accurate estimate of Saturn ring mass. Previous research has shown a relationship between the mass of the rings and their age. Lower mass would point to a younger age, because the rings are initially made of ice and are bright, but over time become contaminated and darkened by interplanetary debris. With that estimate, scientist calculated that the rings are relatively recent, having originated between 100 million years to 10 million years ago.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LONDON  The Telegraph reports that Britain plans to increase its military presence abroad by opening two new bases.UK Defence Minister Gavin Williamson told the newspaper in an interview that a new naval base will be established in Southeast Asia, either in Brunei or Singapore. The British government is also considering building a second base in Montserrat or Guyana in the Caribbean.According to an opinion piece in the Washington Examiner, a naval base in Brunei would allow the UK to support the Americans in 'corralling Chinese forces' by limiting their movement and offering force replenishment.They can also provide strike power by deploying Astute-class submarines at the base. Powerful torpedos and a high-capability sonar system allows the submarines to "complement U.S. Virginia-class counterparts in threatening the enemy while unseen."Brunei is already host to a British Army base, where an infantry battalion of Royal Gurkha Rifles are stationed, along with an Army Air Corps Flight of Bell 212 helicopters.According to a British Ministry of Defense document, a Franco-British carrier strike group may also be deployed in the early 2020s. The UK's HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, and France's Charles de Gaulle will rotate as the formation's primary warship.The move is set to complement Washington's strategy of asserting freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in the South China Sea.But Beijing will likely see it as a threat, especially since the country claims the entire South China Sea as its own, and has militarized several disputed islands in the region.Reuters reports that tensions between Beijing and London were inflamed after a British warship sailed near the Paracel islands on August 31. The HMS Albion was carrying a contingent of Royal Marines when it exercised freedom of navigation rights as it passed the disputed islands while en route to Ho Chi Minh.China regarded the gesture as hostile, and dispatched a frigate and two helicopters to challenge the vessel.The planned base has already been called 'muscle-flexing' by one Chinese professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Russia has likewise condemned plans for British bases, and warned of retaliation if its interests or that of its allies are ever threatened.But support for the U.S. aside, Britain may have other reasons for pushing its plan. According to CNN, a naval base in Asia may also serve as a 'showroom' for military hardware and could result in big arms deals that would benefit the UK's economy.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HILO, HAWAII  A white Democratic Representative from Hawaii stirred controversy after stating he is an  "Asian trapped in a white body", reports The Washington Post. Hawaiian Congressman Ed Case is facing backlash after stating he is an "Asian trapped in a white body" in front of a crowd of Asian and Pacific Islander American members of the new Congress. Yeah, not a good move.According to The Washington Post, the context for the statement is unclear but at this point, does it really matter?By the time Case processed the awkward silence followed by his comment, National Journal fellow Nicholas Wu had already tweeted the congressman's remark and Twitter broke. Reactions from Wu's tweet have been varied but the public's favorite ones seem to be "Yikes", "Nope", or just disapproving gifs. Unsurprising.Others simply replied with images of Scarlett Johanson playing Japanese anime character Motoko Kusanagi in 2017's Ghost In The Shell, comparing the congressman's comments to Hollywood white-washing of Asian characters. Yikes, indeed.Case apologized, stating he was he was "fiercely proud" to represent a state as multicultural as Hawaii and that he regretted if he had offended anyone in the Asian and Pacific Islander community.Case said he made this comment was because that's "what Japanese-American wife sometimes says about him.Clarifying his comments, the Hawaii representative stated, according to a CNN report, "Like so many others from Hawaii who treasure our multicultural heritage, I have absorbed and live the values of our many cultures. They and not my specific ethnicity, are who I am, and I believe that this makes me an effective advocate on national issues affecting our API community."SOURCESCNN, The Washington Post, Nextsharkhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/17/politics/ed-case-hawaii-comments/index.htmlhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/16/rep-ed-case-said-hes-an-asian-trapped-white-body-his-apology-didnt-help/?utm_term=.43ebad089b2dhttps://nextshark.com/hawaiian-rep-ed-case-asian-white-body/]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ATHENS  Tesla may soon be collaborating with Greece to help modernize its power grids by using advanced energy storage technology, reports Elektreck.Tesla has presented Greek officials a proposal to reduce the country's fossil fuel dependency and aid the transition to renewable energy sources. The proposal suggests the creation of a microgrid composed of energy storage systems to power remote Greek islands that are not connected to the country's main power grid.Tesla's previous microgrid projects have been powered by Powerpacks. Tesla Powerpacks are rechargeable batteries that store energy from renewable sources.The Powerpack can store large amounts of energy off-grid and are made to function as large-scale supplemental power systems.Government authorities are reportedly considering conducting a pilot project on the Island of Limnos in the Aegean Sea.A large array of solar panels would be installed in order to power energy storage facilities during the day. The energy stored would be used during the night.Tesla has already built successful energy storage projects in several countries including Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Samoa.In an interview with Capital.gr, the Greek Minister of Environment and Energy, Mr. George Stathakis who met with Tesla said, "The conversion of the islands to renewables, apart from being environmentally useful, is now also economically viable."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[JIANGSU, CHINA  A man in China is going to be sent to prison for allegedly marrying and having children with three different women.A 36-year-old man surnamed Zhang married three different women in a span of three years and arranged for all of them to live within a kilometer of one another, according to local media.The man also claims he didn't know getting married to multiple women is illegal.He apparently exploited a loophole in China's marriage system in which he was able to get married to women from different provinces in the country.Zhang owns a real estate company and was able to support all his families with money he earned through the company.He also made multiple trips throughout the week to visit each of his wives with their children, using the excuse that he going on a "business trip."Zhang's second wife discovered flirty messages between him and another woman, according to the South China Morning Post.She stalked him and found out about his first and third wife, who at the time was pregnant with Zhang's child.Only Zhang's marriage to his first wife was legal. But as soon as she found out, she divorced him.His second and third wife reported him to the police, who charged him with polygamy.Zhang is now looking at up to two years in prison. He claims he will ask his other wives if either one is willing to take him back and forgive him after he gets out of jail.Local media quotes Zhang's second and third wife as saying Zhang is actually a good husband, despite the circumstances. His second wife even went further to say he was "caring and considerate."In interview with Chinese media, Zhang said his "heart is exhausted' dealing with the situation.SOURCES: QQ News, Sohu News, Shanghaiist, The South China Morning Posthttps://new.qq.com/omn/20190113/20190113A0T81J.htmlhttp://www.sohu.com/a/288660945_167383https://shanghai.ist/2019/01/14/man-marries-three-different-women-gets-them-all-apartments-in-same-neighborhood/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2181969/chinese-lothario-faces-court-after-flirtatious-phone-calls-betray]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SOUTH CHINA SEA  Reuters reports that the United States and Britain held their first joint drills in the South China Sea since Beijing built island bases in the disputed waters. According to a US Navy press release, the Arleigh-Burke guided missile destroyer USS McCampbell and the Royal Navy Type 23 frigate HMS Argyll conducted joint operations in the South China Sea from January 11 to 16.The two vessels reportedly carried out communication drills, combined maneuvers, and personnel exchange during the week 'to address common maritime security priorities.'The USS McCampbell is based in Japan, while the HMS Argyll is on a tour of Asia. According to a U.S. Navy spokesman, such drills have not been conducted in the South China Sea since at least 2010.CNN reports that the move is expected to antagonize China, which lays claim to the entire area based on a nebulous nine-dash line.This claim is contested by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan, who all have overlapping territorial claims based on geographical proximity.The U.S. regularly holds freedom of navigation operations to challenge China's excessive maritime claims, such as when the USS McCampbell sailed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands earlier this month.The British warship HMS Albion also sailed close to the Paracels last August, prompting Beijing to accuse London of engaging in "provocation."In both instances, China responded to what they perceive as hostile gestures by deploying aircrafts and ships to challenge the vessels.Chinese state media CCTV reported on January 8 that DF-26 ballistic missiles capable of targeting medium and large ships have been deployed to the northwest plateau.An unidentified expert has been quoted  in the report as noting that the deployment "served as a good reminder that China is capable of safeguarding its territory."According to the Japan Times, the UK-US joint drill also comes on the heels of a trilateral anti-submarine warfare exercise on December 21 to 22, involving a U.S. navy submarine, the Royal Navy's HMS Argyll, and Japan's JS Izumo helicopter destroyer.

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TAIWAN  Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense has announced plans for crucial military drills to to defend against China.The Taiwanese military drills are to be divided into four major parts this year, Focus Taiwan reports. This first part of the drills consists of a month of combat readiness training, followed by a month of live-fire exercises in the second quarter.Taiwan's military also plans to hold drills of joint anti-landing operations as well as joint anti-airbourne exercises in the third and fourth quarter. Taiwan also plans to upgrade its existing 144 F-16 A/B fighter jets by spending around US$3.64 billion, reports DW.The announcement comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping explained China would use military force to bring Taiwan back under their control if necessary. The Chinese military is becoming increasingly aggressive, with more Chinese naval vessels and fighter jets holding exercises near Taiwan, reports Focus Taiwan.Speaking in a Focus Taiwan report, Taiwan's military spokesperson Chen Chung-Chi stressed that the drills are being held to prepare against invasion from the PRC.Business Insider reports, the People's Liberation Army carried out 18,000 military drills last year alone.SOURCES: Focus Taiwan, Deutsche Welle, Business Insider, http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201901090005.aspxhttp://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201802220026.aspxhttps://www.dw.com/en/taiwan-prepares-to-hold-large-scale-military-drills-to-deter-china/a-47107430https://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-is-changing-up-combat-drills-in-preparation-for-war-with-china-2019-1]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TLAHUELILPAN, MEXICO  Mexican officials say at least 79 people were killed in a fuel pipeline blast last Friday in the town of Tlahuelilpan, in Hidalgo state. According to Reuters, suspected fuel thieves punctured the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline a few miles from one of the country's main refineries on Friday, causing a large get of fuel to rise into the air.  According to authorities, around 800 people scrambled to fill up containers from the 23-foot (7 meter) gasoline geyser.   A few hours later, the geyser erupted in flames in a powerful explosion.During a press conference, Pemex chief executive Octavio Romero said the company was aware of a leak along the pipeline at around 16:50 local time. According to BBC, locals said President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's new policy to crack down on fuel theft has created shortages.  Mexico says fuel theft cost the country about US$3 billion just last year. President López Obrador has said he will continue his anti-theft policy until the illegal practice was stopped.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA  NASA has unveiled the massive main tank of a rocket that will be used to send humans to Mars.Just last week Elon Musk revealed images of a Starship prototype, and now NASA has begun testing the main tank of a rocket bound for outer space.The hydrogen tank for NASA's Space Launch System rocket was loaded into a test stand at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama on Jan. 14.According to a NASA report, hydraulic cylinders installed in the test stand will push and pull the tank, mimicking the pressure it would have to withstand during lift-off and flight. The SLS rocket tank is a 61-meter tall liquid hydrogen tank and is eight-meters in diameter. Its design allows it to hold over 2 million liters of supercooled liquid nitrogen.The tank will feed the rocket's RS-25 engines with cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen producing almost nine million pounds of maximum thrust. The launch vehicle is designed to carry NASA's Orion spacecraft as well as other cargo into deep space for exploration.Orion is one of NASA's next generation exploration spacecraft. It is able to carry four crew members within its crew module. NASA hopes to use it to on its first manned mission to the Red Planet.In October of 2018, NASA tested its Ignition Overpressure Protection and Sound Suppression water deluge system as part of the preparation for launching the Space Launch System rocket.The SLS rocket is one of the most powerful rockets designed by NASA. It will boost Orion at a speed of almost 40,000 kilometers per hour out of Earth's orbit. That's roughly, 11,000 kilometers per hour faster than the International Space Station travels around Earth.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  A strange space object has been a topic of debate among scientists and astronomers, with one Israeli Harvard professor claiming it is likely an alien probe, reports Israeli newspaper Haaretz.Oumuamua is a reddish interstellar object that was first seen using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii on October 2017, as it passed by Earth at 156,428 kilometers per hour.Its odd shape and unusual level of acceleration have made it an object of speculation among the astronomic community.Oumuamua, whose name comes from a Hawaiian word meaning "scout" or "messenger sent from the distant past to reach out to us", is the first interstellar object observed in the Solar System. It is 400 meters long and roughly 40 meters wide.Scientists are debating whether or not the object is an asteroid or a comet with some even suggesting it has extraterrestrial origins. According to a theoretical paper written by Israeli Harvard Professor Abraham Loeb published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, states that the object is likely a space probe that passed by our solar system.The hypothesis suggests it is powered by lightsail energy, also known as solar sail technology, and that its reddish color might be a layer of interstellar dust.The paper suggests a second hypothesis claiming the object's random trajectory might mean it is an alien probe intentionally passing by Earth's vicinity.In December 2017, astronomers attempted to listen for radio signals coming from the object but could not capture any. However, Professor Loeb is not losing hope.During his interview with Haaretz, Professor Loeb stated, "As soon as we leave the solar system, I believe we will see a great deal of traffic out there. Possibly we'll get a message that says, 'Welcome to the interstellar club.' Or we'll discover multiple dead civilizations  that is, we'll find their remains."

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA  Relativity Space's 3D printed rocket could be launching from Cape Canaveral before the end of 2020.Relativity Space made different parts for their new rocket, Terran-1, using their 3D printer Stargate, according to the company's website.The Terran-1 would take around 60 days to print. When all the parts are put together, the rocket would be around 100-feet tall. It would also be able to carry a payload of nearly 2,750 pounds.Relativity Space has also received permission from the U.S. Air Force to launch Terran-1 at Cape Canaveral in Florida.The company is hoping to launch the 3D-printed rocket by the end of 2020.If the launch is successful, the company could get to lease the site for up to 20 years, according to Business Insider.SOURCES: Futurism.com, Quartz, Business Insider, Florida Today, Relativity Space, https://futurism.com/air-force-grants-launch-site-3d-printed-rocket-relativity-spacehttps://qz.com/1526158/rocket-start-up-relativity-leased-a-launch-pad-from-the-us-air-force/https://www.businessinsider.com/relativity-space-rockets-launchpad-cape-canaveral-2019-1https://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2019/01/17/relativity-launch-rockets-cape-canaveral/2603166002/https://www.relativityspace.com/mission]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The Associated Press reports that President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a revamped missile defense strategy.In a speech at the Pentagon, Trump reportedly declared space as 'the new warfighting domain,' and says the U.S. is prepared to make use of it. The Donald claims the goal is to ensure 'Murica "can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States  anywhere, anytime, anyplace."There's no mention of Russia, China, or North Korea in the speech, but they're all countries that are developing advanced weapons systems.Russia recently unveiled new strategic weapons that can't be intercepted, like a hypersonic glide vehicle which can fly 20 times faster than the speed of sound.It's also capable of making sharp maneuvers to avoid detection by missile defense systems.According to Michael Griffin, defense undersecretary for research engineering, a network of sensors and interceptors in space will be key to detecting hypersonic missiles in their early, vulnerable stages.Voice of America reports that such technologies could detect an enemy missile launch much sooner. They can shoot it down in space or even as the missile is launching.Democratic Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey immediately raised concerns over the plan, calling it a "bad Star Wars sequel." He claims Trump's "misguided rush to weaponize space" would be expensive, dangerous, and probably ineffective.Sure, America may be facing a different missile threat environment now, but Markey says building a wall in space is not the answer.SOURCES: Associated Press, Voice of America, USA Todayhttps://apnews.com/33e12cf640a6408bb11aa3defa864966https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-unveil-space-based-missile-defense-strategy/4747188.htmlhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/17/space-force-donald-trump-missile-defense/2602115002/***]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[VANCOUVER, CANADA  Scientists at the University of British Columbia have grown a pair human blood vessels for the first time.Scientists used stem cells to grow organoids in a petri dish, according to a study published in the journal Nature.The organoids were then planted in mice and had a survival rate of more than 95 percent.The researchers observed that the organoids had developed into human blood vessels with arteries and capillaries after six months.The research team from UBC used this same technique to study the impact of diabetes on these lab-grown blood vessels, according to New Atlas.Diabetes causes the membrane that surrounds the blood vessels to expand and decreases the amount of oxygen and nutrients delivered to the cells and tissue.This in turn increases the risk of health problems such as heart attacks, kidney failure and blindness.The researchers found that none of the current anti-diabetic medications helped in curing the flawed blood vessels.However, they did find an enzyme inhibitor which could help in preventing the membrane from expanding.This discovery could be beneficial in treating diabetes in the future.The researchers say the lab-grown blood vessels could help in finding treatments and determine the cause for different vascular disease such as Alzheimer's disease, wound healing problems and diabetes.SOURCES: New Atlas, University of British Columbia news release, Nature Journal, https://newatlas.com/stem-cells-blood-vessels/58095/https://news.ubc.ca/2019/01/16/scientists-grow-perfect-human-blood-vessels-in-a-petri-dish/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0858-8]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TOKYO   Shooting stars may become a luxury product in 2020. A Japanese start-up has sent one of its test satellites into space and if all goes well we might witness the world's first artificial meteor shower.A satellite from a Japanese aerospace company called Astro Live Experiences, or ALE, has successfully entered Earth's orbit after being launched into space on Jan. 18. ALE's first satellite will gather data on the environment of the Earth's atmosphere in order to determine the feasibility of creating an artificial meteor shower.The satellite was launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency on the Epsilon-4 rocket along with six other tech demo satellites. According to The Japan Times, the cost per launch of the Epsilon-4 is $50 million.According to a press release by the company, the satellite is designed to imitate a meteor shower by firing small 1-centimeter metal pellets at high-speed into the Earth's atmosphere.The space venture company states that the pellets will not cause any damage to existing satellites or air crafts because they will completely burn up at 60 to 80 kilometers above ground. Airplanes fly at an altitude of 10 kilometers.During a meteor shower show, the pellets will travel one-fifth of the way around Earth before entering the atmosphere. On average, five to twenty pellets will be released, each of which will remain visible for roughly three to ten seconds.The company hopes to create its first artificial meteor shower show above the city of Hiroshima. According to ALE, the shower will be visible to over 6 million people in an area of up to 200 kilometers.But no matter how pretty the artificial meteor might look it raises the following question: Do we need to throw more junk into space? The answer for space debris and space junk expert Hugh Lewis is no.In an interview with the BBC, he stated, "Given the fact that we're trying to encourage good behavior in the space environment and so on, just to throw things up there because they look pretty is a bit problematic." Also, ordering a meteor shower for your date whenever and particularly, wherever you are is not as simple as the Japanese "space entertainment" company makes it seem. According to Lewis, "You could miss by an entire continent."But honestly, you don't need to be an expert to realize this is probably one of the galactically dumbest and most wasteful ideas ever.

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TIBET  The Print reports that China's various infrastructure projects in Tibet could have military implications for India.China is building the G-6 expressway to connect Beijing to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. While the Beijing to Xining portion is completed, the 546-kilometer stretch between Xining and Lhasa is still under construction.From Lhasa, a 75-kilometer long, four-lane road is also being built to provide direct access to Tsedang, via huge twin tunnels that will cut across the mountain range.The infrastructure for a Tibetan railway line from Lhasa to Nyingchi is also underway. The railway line is reportedly being laid, with stations being built in Gonggar, Dranang, Tsedang, and Nyingchi.Satellite images published by The Print also reveal an underground facility constructed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army just 50 kilometers from the Indian border and 60 kilometers from the Indian Army's forward post.The projects have strategic implications for the PLA, allowing convoys to cover the 3,725-kilometer distance between Beijing and Lhasa in four days or less.But the large number of strategic routes may negatively impact India, as they could face serious difficulties in any future confrontation with China, according to a commentary from the Observer Research Foundation.The Indian vice chief of army staff has voiced serious concerns about the lack of funding for the Army, pointing to Chinese infrastructural development along the northern borders to seek more resource allocation.]]></videoDesc>

Now even hamburgers have to follow the one China principle? You've got to be kidding me!"Twitter users also shared their thoughts on the issue with most finding the situation to be "ridiculous" and "hilarious."SOURCES: Next Shark, Taipei Times, Focus Taiwan, United Daily Newshttps://nextshark.com/mcdonalds-taiwan-china-ad/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/01/20/2003708291http://focustaiwan.tw/news/acs/201901190009.aspxhttps://udn.com/news/story/7331/3602455]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SYDNEY  Looks like our favorite same-sex penguin couple in Sydney's Sea Life Aquarium are father and father to a female penguin, according to CNN. Sphen and Magic brought the baby chick into the world in October as eyeballs around the world watched with melting hearts. The two pals are male gentoo penguins who became joined at the hip last year, right before breeding season. Since the two were always hanging out, waddling around and going for dips together, the aquarium thought they would make good prospective parents. After another couple laid two eggs, Sphen and Magic were given the chance to hatch the "backup" egg.According to CNN, it's typical for gentoo penguins to lay two eggs each breeding season, but the crazy cold Antarctic temperatures usually means only one egg can be successfully incubated and raised, so the "backup" may not make it. The best buds hatched a super-cute 91-gram penguin chick on October 19, 2018. Because both sexes look similar, it takes experts a few months and a blood test to figure out the gender of a penguin. In this case, it was a girl, who for the moment is going by the name Baby Sphengic. Don't worry, a real name is coming soon. In the meantime, Baby Sphengic has been learning to dive as well as having quite the appetite.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TAOYUAN, TAIWAN  EVA Air flight attendants were left traumatized after they were forced to wipe down an American-sized American who couldn't reach his own backside. According to Apple Daily, tons of fun first had to be wheeled onto the plane on a Walmart wagon because he's got issues with standing and gravity for the flight from L.A. to Taipei.The man then whined to be put in a row with three seats because of his slender size, which the airline allowed because the flight wasn't full. Then the real fun began when he demanded that a flight attendant help him go Number 2. The 440-pound delight then said he couldn't use his right hand because of surgery and that the economy toilet was too small for him. He then had to be escorted to the business class toilet, where he actually didn't want to shut the door because he wanted "better circulation." Thank god the flight attendant said hell no. Sunshine immediately pressed the emergency button and demanded the cabin crew pull down his pants for his, or watch him take a dump right on the floor.He then had the gall to demand they wipe him when he was finished destroying the toilet. One of the flight attendants was then forced to put on three pairs of latex gloves and going into the abyssthree times in total no less. Here's a question though, how does Free Willy normally clean himself after the bathroom? Can't be pleasant.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NORTH KOREA  NBC reports that researchers from a Washington based think-tank have discovered a secret missile base in North Korea  one of more than a dozen undisclosed sites in the Hermit Kingdom.North Korea's Sino-ri Missile Base is a seven square mile complex located 132 miles north of the DMZ.According to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the base has played a key role in developing ballistic missiles capable of reaching South Korea, Japan, and Guam.Sino-ri is one of about 20 undisclosed sites used to develop the country's ballistic missile program. It houses a regiment sized unit equipped with Nodong-1 medium range ballistic missiles.Satellite photos from December 2018 identifies entrances to an underground bunker or facility, hardened shelters, a headquarters area, and a communication facility among others.The base is supported by two nearby facilities. Sobaek-su Academy is a ballistic missile school for Strategic Rocket Forces personnel that also conducts research on "ballistic missile design and operation.The Myodu-san training area is believed to be the primary field training facility for both the missile base and the academy.CSIS previously identified 13 of the 20 undeclared missile operating sites last November.One site, the Sakkanmol missile base, reportedly had barracks and underground facilities to house transporter-erector-launches or mobile-erector-launchers.Reuters reports that the discovery comes just days after Trump announced he looks forward to discussing denuclearization with Kim Jong Un at a second summit in late February.According to CSIS, North Korean missile bases would be subject to declaration, verification, and dismantlement in any denuclearization deal. But since Sino-ri and the 19 other bases have never been declared by North Korea, they "do not appear to be the subject of denuclearization negotiations."Victor Cha, one of the report's authors, says it looks like North Korea is playing a game. Even if they destroy their disclosed nuclear facilities, they will still have operational capability.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The magnetic North Pole is moving at an alarming rate and forcing researchers to update a navigational model. According to The Washington Post, almost half of the employees from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is responsible for updating the World Magnetic Model, are on furlough due to the government shutdown, as the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives refuses to fund U.S. President Donald Trump's $5 billion border wall.Earth's poles naturally shift and change due to unpredictable flows of molten liquid iron at the Earth's core caused by the planet's rotation. This liquid's movement creates the Earth's magnetic field. However, an article posted in the journal Nature shows that the Earth's magnetic North Pole has been moving at an unprecedented rate. The movement began in the mid-1990s and it is now headed towards Siberia at roughly 55 kilometers per year.Scientists from the NOAA and the British Geological Survey study and update the World Magnetic Model every five years.However, due to the dramatic movement, the model needs to be updated earlier than scheduled. The current government shutdown has forced the NOAA to postpone the update from January 15 to January 30.This model is necessary for accurate civilian and military navigation. According to the report, the abrupt changes may be due to a geomagnetic pulse that occurred beneath South America in 2016.In 2017, Phil Livermore a geophysicist from the University of Leeds detected a high-speed jet of liquid iron beneath Canada that seemed to be weakening the magnetic field in that area. Livermore believes this could be linked to the current changes in the earth's magnetic field.SOURCES:Nature, Reuters, The Washington Post, Maritime Executive https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00007-1https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-north/shifting-north-magnetic-pole-forces-unprecedented-navigation-fix-idUSKCN1P51UEhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/01/17/north-pole-is-moving-shutdown-means-we-arent-keeping-up/?utm_term=.a7c734b372d2https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/magnetic-north-pole-shifting-rapidly-and-unpredicatably]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ATLANTA  Scientists have developed a new carbon capture system that absorbs CO2 and produces useable electricity and hydrogen fuel, according to New Atlas. Researchers from Georgia Tech and Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology designed the device using the ocean's carbon sink ability as inspiration, and published their results in the journal Science in Nov. 2018. According to New Atlas, the device is called the Hybrid Na-CO2 System and is in essence a large liquid battery. A sodium metal anode is place in an organic electrolyte, while the cathode is placed in an aqueous solution. The two liquids are separated by a sodium Super Ionic Conductor membrane, or NASICON. When carbon dioxide is pumped into the aqueous electrolyte, it reacts with the cathode, turning the solution more acidic, which then generates electricity and creates hydrogen. During testing, the system reported a CO2 conversion efficiency of 50 percent and was able to run for over 1,000 hours without damage to the electrodes. Another benefit of the system is that no CO2 is released during the process. The leftover CO2 from the electrolyte is recovered as baking soda. For carbon capture systems to become practical however, they would need to be produced at a much larger scales in order to have an impact on reducing levels of atmospheric CO2.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HOUSTON  Most of Earth's vital elements for life mostly likely came from a planetary collision that also created the moon more than 4.4 billion years ago, according to a Rice University study published in the journal Science Advances. For life to occur on a planet, volatile elements including carbon, nitrogen and sulfur must be present. According to the study, a catastrophic collision between Earth while it was still forming and a Mars-sized object with volatile elements could explain how these elements were introduced. Researchers used a combination of high-temperature, high-pressure experiments to mimic these conditions in the lab. The results were then fed into computer simulations that were able to determine the size and chemical composition of the impacting planet.  The team conclude that Earth's volatiles arrived from a collision with an embryonic planet that had a sulfur-rich core.]]></videoDesc>

One European Commission official noted in an email that it could be deployed in a smart cities approach.The Zephyr is a 'High Altitude Pseudo Satellite' or HAPS that charges its batteries via solar panels and can stay operative for weeks.Facebook and Airbus are reportedly testing the Model S, which has a 25-meter wingspan. TechCrunch reports that it operates at an altitude of 20 kilometers, and uses millimeter-wave radio to broadcast to the ground.The project is similar to Facebook's Aquila drone program, which aimed to provide internet connectivity to remote parts of the world. It was dropped in 2018 after years of development.Though it's clear that Airbus and Facebook met with the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority to discuss the test flights, it's unclear if they actually took place.A Facebook spokesperson told Netzpolitik, 'We continue to work with partners on High Altitude Platform System connectivity. We don't have further details to share at this time.' Airbus did not respond to a request for comment.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SPACE  A new study presents a new hypothesis explaining the origins of the first-ever black holes in the pre-galactic universe, according to science journal Nature.  After 13 billion years, light from the universe's first black holes is finally reaching Earth.The origin of supermassive black holes is still a mystery to humans. However, a group of scientists have used simulation-technology to present an interesting hypothesis.The new simulation-based study, conducted by scientists from various universities, found that massive black holes can be formed when galaxies assemble extremely rapidly and violently.According to the paper published in the journal Nature, the team used a 70-terabyte dataset called Renaissance Simulation. This program allows scientists to view a simulation of the early universe's evolution.In this particular study, the team used it to learn more about the regions where massive black holes were more likely to develop. The researchers found ten dark matter halos that should have become stars but only contained dense gas clouds.These regions of dense clouds were where most black holes began forming. This means that as this simulated galaxy formed quickly, star formation was disrupted leaving behind a dense gas cloud and allowing massive black hole formation to take over."Early theories of black hole formation suggest that supermassive black holes can only be formed in regions exposed to high levels of star-formation killing radiation. These new findings indicate that massive black holes are actually not that rare and do not depend solely on radiation to appear.Black holes are still one of the most ancient enigmas to exist since the beginning of time  literally  but researchers hope these simulations can continue to help unravel the mysteries of these pre-galactic giants.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BUFFALO, NEW YORK  New research claims it has successfully reversed memory loss in an animal model of Alzheimer's. New research published in the journal Brain has discovered that memory loss in Alzheimer's found in animals was linked to epigenetics. Epigenetics are alterations found in gene expressions that are not derived from DNA sequences. A team of scientists from the University at Buffalo studied mouse models that carried Alzheimer's Disease as well as post-mortem brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's.Scientists discovered that a process linked to epigenetics called repressive histone modification affected memory loss in Alzheimer's patients. The abnormal histone modifications detected reduce glutamate receptors. This leads to loss in synaptic function and memory deficiency. The animals were injected three times with special compounds made to inhibit the histone modifier that was causing memory loss.Results showed that the animals recovered glutamate receptor expression and function in the frontal cortex. These improvements lasted for a week.According to the Alzheimer's Association, every 65 seconds someone in the United States develops the disease. Currently, roughly 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's dementia.

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[PITTSBURGH  A team of researchers has successfully erased cocaine-related memories in rats using optogenetics. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine made rats addicted to cocaine by giving them an infusion of cocaine each time the rats pressed a lever. The infusion would be accompanied by a tone and a light.According to the paper published in the journal Cell Reports, the rats would then associate the tone and light with the cocaine high and would exhibit drug-seeking behavior by repeatedly pressing the lever.The team studied electrical recordings from rat brain tissue and found essential connections between the medial geniculate nucleus and the lateral amygdala. These connections created memories that associated the cocaine high with external cues.The team then used a biological technique called optogenetics to erase memories related to cocaine use. Optogenetics uses light to alter cell behavior. It allows scientists to turn neurons on or off selectively. Rats that had memories related to cocaine erased pressed the lever fewer times than those who did not go through the optogenetic procedure. These rats also resisted the drug even when placed in a different environment.]]></videoDesc>

He also has no influence on day-to-day administration, which includes distributing food and medicine to the populaceMaduro has responded to the Trump administration's support of Guaido by severing diplomatic ties with the U.S. He gave American diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, but Washington has refused to comply.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[EARTH  There are a lot of misconceptions when it comes to what are the causes and, most importantly, the effects of global warming and climate change. Here they are, explained.Welcome to 2019, where people believe the Earth is flat, vaccines cause autism and climate change isn't real… What is going on in this world? Even 'Murica's Commander in Chief's tweeted that it "wouldn't be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!" following reports of cold weather in some regions of the US. Unfortunately for The Donald, facts are facts and a cold winter does not disprove global warming, in fact, it is a result of it. Let us explain.The terms "weather" and "climate" are not interchangeable. Weather refers to daily variations in temperature, precipitation, wind etc. And, according to the NOAA, climate is the average weather conditions of an area over at least a 30-year period.Global warming refers to the gradual increase of the Earth's average temperature. The sudden rise in temperature in recent years is primarily attributed to the increasing presence of greenhouse gases caused by human activity.These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone.Climate change refers to changes in weather patterns in Earth over an extended period of time. These changes are natural, however, activities including fossil fuel combustion, land use, deforestation, and agriculture magnify these changes.Research published in 2018 in Nature Communications explained that the record-breaking cold weather and polar vortex disruptions are caused by Arctic warming.Fast flowing air currents located in the Earth's northern hemisphere called jet streams are responsible for weather fluctuations around the globe. These winds move from east-to-west and are pushed by the difference between Arctic and tropical air.Higher temperatures in the Arctic make the jetstream move further south. This fluctuation causes places located to the South of the Arctic to experience colder winters.So there you have it, folks. Human activity is unnaturally raising the average temperature of the Earth and this, in turn, affects jetstreams which are largely responsible for fluctuations in weather  hot and cold.A paper published in the journal Science Advances states that instances of extreme weather could increase by up to 50 percent in 2100.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MALAGA,SPAIN  The rescue mission to save a two-year-old boy from a well in Spain has encountered some unexpected problems.Julen Rosello, a two-year-old boy, was with his family when he walked away and unexpectedly fell down a narrow well on January 13, The Guardian reports.The well is around 25 centimeters wide and is believed to be 100 meters deep. Rescuers found the boy's bag of sweets and a cup when they lowered a camera down around 75 meters into the well.The Spanish Civil Guard stated that rescuers did attempt to widen the hole, reported NBC, citing TVE.They reportedly attempted this while also trying to dig an alternate shaft in order to connect the two tunnels and rescue the baby. The rescuers have now finished digging a second vertical shaft in an effort to reach the boy, El Pais reports. They were originally planning to go down using a cage to dig a horizontal tunnel into the first shaft.However, the cage got stuck 40 meters down the shaft. They were aiming to reach 60 meters depth. A rescue team are now planning to dig 4 meters to connect with the first shaft. Each of them will work in 40 to 60 minute shifts. It will take around 24 hours for them to connect to the first borehole, according to El Pais.Rescuers have yet to locate the boy. They have only managed to find strands of hair with DNA that matches his.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MIAMI  A young family was booted from an American Airlines flight after other passengers complained about supposed offensive body odor. According to Local 10 News, Yossi Adler, his wife, and their 1-year-old daughter were attempting to get back to Detroit, when they were escorted off the plane. According to Adler, "all of a sudden, as soon as they took us off, they closed the gate and then said 'Sorry, sir, some people complained you had body odor and we're not letting you back on.'"The Adlers were told they would get their luggage back, but that was obviously a lie considering the airline just jams all the luggage in the cargo hold. According to American Airlines, the Adlers were given a hotel room and some crappy meal vouchers. They were then rebooked on a Thursday flight.The next morning, the Adlers showed up at the airport and actually had to walk up to random people asking if they smelled. Yossi said he's frustrated and wants to know the real reason they were forced off the plane. Well, it definitely wasn't for their religious beliefs because there's no way anyone in America would ever discriminate against other people over their religion, especially on airplanes.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LYON, FRANCE  An easyJet flight from Lyon was diverted after a student pulled a bomb hoax to avoid seeing his folks, reports the Independent.EasyJet flight EZY4319 was en route to Rennes on January 18 when a bomb threat was made via an anonymous call.The plane, which was carrying 159 passengers, was forced to turn around and land back at Lyon, where it landed safely and was met by the fire brigade and the cops.The bomb threat turned out to be bogus, and police identified the caller as a 23-year-old student from Rennes whose parents were on the diverted flight. The guy was apparently trying to stop his parents from coming to visit him, and resorted to pretty stupid means to get them off his back.Needless to say, it didn't end well. He's been arrested by police and charged with "false news compromising the safety of an aircraft in flight." He's looking at up to five years in the slammer if he's found guilty, and probably a whole lotta visits from mom and dad.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  Research published in Nature Geoscience presents new evidence that debunks the existence of a correlation between solar activity and winter weather in the North.The North Atlantic Oscillation is a key driver of winter weather patterns in the Northern hemisphere. A positive NAO is linked to mild and wet winters in Europe, while a negative NAO indicates a snowy and cold winters.According to Columbia University, published research in recent years claims the NAO is linked to the solar cycle, a periodic, 11-year change during which the sun's activity increases then ebbs.The theory indicates that the connection between the two is strong enough to inform predictions of the NAO by up to a decade in advance.But using computer modeling and extended observations, scientists at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and Columbia's School of Engineering found no evidence of any correlation prior to 1960. The apparent correlation had been due to atmospheric variability, and not the sun.The correlation theory would have proven advantageous to Northern hemisphere societies, as it would have allowed them to plan for intense flooding and storms.But the research debunking the link is also important for future climate research, now that it appears the causes for decadal weather changes lie elsewhere.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CANADA  A Nazi Germany research book believed to be owned by World War 2 dictator Adolf Hitler is said to detail his plans for North America.The Library and Archives of Canada acquired the German-language book from a U.S. collector, CBC reports.Translated to English, the book's title is "Statistics, Press, and Organization of Jewry in the United States and Canada."Michael Kent, curator of the library, told CBC that information in the book "would have been the building blocks to rolling out the final solution in Canada."It reportedly contains a detailed list of Jewish populations across cities in North America.The book was written by a Nazi researcher named Heinz Kloss in 1944. Kloss lived in the U.S. for a while before World War II, CBC reports. He probably gathered his information through Nazi sympathizers and other researchers in North America, according to CBC.Kent told CBC Canada that the book was likely stored in Hitler's alpine retreat in Germany.Hitler collected between 6,000 to 16,000 books over his lifetime, according to the BBC.Another major hint that the book was Hitler's property, is that it was labeled with the phrase "Ex Libris Adolf Hitler" inside. That indicates it likely came from Hitler's collection.Kent said that the book was more than likely taken by the Allies as a souvenir when they occupied Germany.In a news release, the Library and Archives of Canada stated : "This work hints at the story of what might have happened in Canada had the allies lost World War II." They added: "It also demonstrates that the Holocaust was not a purely European event, but rather an operation that was stopped before it reached North America."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NEW YORK  Climate change is affecting Earth's hydrological cycle causing the land to lose the ability to absorb CO2 emissions.New research paper by Columbia University's School of Engineering studied how fluctuations in the Earth's hydrological cycle caused by climate change can affect the capability of continents to trap carbon dioxide emissions.Currently, the ocean and other terrestrial biospheres are absorbing roughly 50 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.According to the paper published in the journal Nature, they analyzed data from four Earth system models to look for reductions in net biome productivity caused by changes in soil moisture. Net biome productivity or NBP refers to the net gain or loss of carbon from a region over a period of time. Results from the study showed that the land was only absorbing half as much carbon dioxide as it could have been due to changes in soil moisture.If extreme weather events continue to affect the Earth's hydrological cycle, the land's ability to absorb carbon dioxide will be reduced causing even more extreme weather due to carbon dioxide overload in the atmosphere.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA  Duke University professor Megan Neely, sent an email urging Chinese students to only speak in English while they were on school grounds or face consequences. Two of Neely's colleagues told her a couple of international students were speaking in Chinese in the lounge or study areas, The Chronicle, Duke University's student newspaper, reports.This is when Neely, then director of graduate studies for the biostatistic graduate program at Duke's School of Medicine, sent an email asking first and second-year graduate students to "commit to using English 100% of the time."Neely said two faculty members had complained that the students were speaking "very loudly."They said they were "disappointed" that the students weren't using the opportunity to "improve their English."Screenshots of the email circulated on social media with one user tweeting: "Last time I checked, [the] U.S. doesn't have an official language."The school faculty also wanted to record the names of the students speaking in Mandarin Chinese, according to the email.One Chinese netizen took to social media site Weibo to complain that the incident was a case of "clear racial discrimination."Another posted on Weibo: "Why is this okay? Do Chinese universities restrict foreign students from speaking in their mother tongue once they are out of the classroom?"However, a third Weibo user took a more softer approach, writing: "Honestly, I don't think this is racism, people are being too sensitive to the issue. You should practice your English since you are overseas."Neely has stepped down as director of graduate studies at Duke University's medical school after facing backlash for her email, The Chronicle reports.She remains an assistant professor at the university.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG   Huawei is being accused of plagiarising a YouTube music video for an advert of their MediaPad M3 Lite, reports Engadget.As if having their CFO arrested in a foreign country for violating sanctions against Iran wasn't enough publicity, Huawei also decided to dabble in a bit of plagiarism.Back in 2014, musician Nigel Stanford posted an elaborate music video showing multiple copies of himself playing instruments that make fire, water, table salt, move to the beat of different audio frequencies. At one point Stanford walks around a Tesla coil wearing chainmail.The video gained traction in YouTube, racking over 24 million views on YouTube to date. Pretty cool right? Huawei thought so as well. In fact, the video is so great that the tech company decided to make its own version of it years later to promote their MediaPad M3 Lite.Only their version had scenes that were almost identical to the original video, some of which can obviously be seen in this side-by-side comparison Stanford shared on his Facebook page. According to Stanford, not only were the shots surprisingly similar but the choice in music  which Stanford had composed for his video  was similar as well.Since these allegations were made, Huawei has removed their video from their YouTube channel and reportedly told Engadget that they're "looking into this matter and will share further updates in due course."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SYDNEY  Volvo is working on what it calls Living Seawalls which mimic the structure of mangrove roots, to recreate habitats for marine life that were once supported by mangrove trees.It is building one Living Seawall in Sydney, Australia, where half of the coastline is now comprised of artificial seawalls.Volvo is working with the Sydney Institute of Marine Science and Reef Design Lab to build the Living Seawall, which will be made up of a total of 50 3D-printed tiles. The tiles will be reinforced with recycled plastic fibers.These tiles are designed to mimic the root structure of native mangrove trees in Sydney, and it is hoped they will provide a habitat for marine life that was lost when mangrove forests gave way to artificial coastlines.The artificial seawall will be able to attract filter-feeding organisms which will aid in absorbing and filtering out toxic pollutants, according to Volvo's website.The Living Seawall will be installed on the existing seawall structure in Sydney Harbor.Humans produce around 300 million tonnes of plastic waste every year, according to the UN.Australians produce 3 million tons of plastic every year  of which only 12 percent is recycled, according to WWF Australia.Items such plastic water bottles, grocery bags and straws all end up in the ocean on a daily basis, according to EcoWatch.Volvo says researchers will observe the seawall for the next 20 years as it improves biodiversity and water quality.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[NEW YORK  Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber among other top model to be subpoenaed for Fyre Festival scam, reports Billboard. The Fyre Festival was on fire alright  but more the "crash and burn" type of fire. And now two years later, things are still going down in flames.According to Billboard, Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber, Emily Ratajkowski among other models are expected to be subpoenaed as part of the festival's bankruptcy filing. Back in 2017, the models used their social media presence to sucker unsuspecting rich, gullible millennials to the chaotic music festival.Hadid, Bieber and Ratajkowski also shot a promotional video where they were seen frolicking on pristine white beaches. Meanwhile, Jenner was said to have received $250,000 in January 2017 to promote the event. She was also included in the festival's pitch to investors. In case you've forgotten, the so-called "luxury" music festival the girls were promoting promised attendees "two transformative weekends" in the Bahamas along with gourmet meals, performances by Blink-182 and Migos, modern eco-friendly accommodations... The list goes on.But what guests found upon arrival were disaster relief tents with wet mattresses, no running water, portable toilets, really sad meals, oh, and Blink-182 canceled their appearances days before the festival. According to Rolling Stone, tickets were priced between  $5,000 and $250,000.Fyre Festival organizer Billy MacFarland has since been sentenced to six years in prison in October and has to forfeit $26 million.Hulu and Netflix both recently released their own versions of the behind the scenes of the disastrous music festival.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  Scientists in China have successfully cloned monkeys with genetic disease symptoms, according to two papers published in National Science Review.Science China Press reports that researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences used the CRISPR-Cas9 method to on in-vitro fertilized monkey embryos. With no BMAL1 to help manage their circadian rhythm, the resulting monkeys exhibited "a wide range of circadian disorder phenotypes."After taking a fibroblast from the gene-edited monkey, scientists used somatic cell nuclear transfer to replace the nucleus of a monkey egg cell with the fibroblast nucleus.325 embryos were implanted in 65 surrogate monkeys. This resulted in 16 pregnancies but only five live births.All five cloned monkeys carried the altered BMAL1 gene introduced in the donor monkey. They also showed the same circadian disorder symptoms, such as reduced sleep, increased night activity, increased anxiety and depression, and schizophrenia-like behaviors.The Chinese team claims the identical specimens could be useful in studying disease pathogenesis and treatment. Cloning genetically altered animals could also reduce the number needed for research.But the experiment raises many ethical concerns, especially with regard to animal rights. A video showing the five monkeys behaving erratically has been widely described as disturbing.According to Futurism, scientists are also questioning whether insight gleaned from such research would even translate to humans, since many animal studies do not.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LONDON  McDonald's is jazzing up their Big Mac recipe in the UK by adding strips of glorious, glorious bacon.According to the Sun, it's the first time the fast food giant is changing the recipe for its iconic burger in 51 years.The Big Mac originally consists of two beef patties, special sauce, onions, pickles, lettuce, and cheese in a three-piece bun. And now it's got bacon, which no one ever complained about. For the same price too!Apart from the sexy new bacon number, McDonald's is also bringing back two Big Mac variants, which can be had with or without the extra pork.The Mac Junior is basically a baby version with just one patty, while the Grand Big Mac is its supersized sibling. The pair are surprisingly popular, and quickly sold out last time they were launched in January 2018.According to the Mirror, the Junior and Grand are only available until March 19, but the bacon Big Mac is here to stay. That's at least one piece of good news for the Brits.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Eva Air is readying itself again for the supersized 'Murican who traumatized a Taiwanese flight attendant by forcing her to wipe his truck-sized behind, according to Taiwan News.  On Jan. 19, the 450-pound plus terror was rolled onto the flight where he forced a female flight attendant to help pull down his drawers and clean his backside while using the toilet.  According to SETN, a flight attendant for the airline said the 450 pound-plus terror has booked a flight foy May 17, when he will squeeze himself onto Eva Air Flight 212 from Bangkok to Taipei, before being shipped back to L.A. On Jan. 26, Eva Air released records of Tiny's 20 previous flights with the airline whichsurprise, surpriseincluded other similar nasty behavior. In May of 2018 on an SF flight to Bangkok, the man also asked to use the business class toilet and that he be wiped down. Crew let the man use the john, but said no way to the wiping. On a flight from Taipei to Bangkok in 2018, tons of fun asked crew members to help him clean out his urine bottle, which they did while wearing gloves of course. But here's the real mystery, why would a guywho clearly has a way with peopletravel to Bangkok so many times? Must be for the Thai food.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS   Scientists have created a device that can power electronics, wearables, and other devices without the use of batteries or wires, according to MIT News.Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created a rectifying antenna, or rectenna, using a thin molybdenum disulphide semiconductor that's only three atoms thick.Electromagnetic waves like Wi-Fi are captured via the device's radio frequency antenna, and then converted into direct current.The rectenna produced 40 microwatts of power when exposed to typical wifi signals of around 150 microwatts, enough to power an LED or silicon chips.According to MIT, early applications for the technology include flexible smartphones and wearable electronics.The device can also reportedly be used to power medical implants or swallowable sensors in place of traditional batteries, which can leak lithium and be lethal to patients.Due to its flexibility, the device can be fabricated to cover large areas. Researchers believe it's possible to develop electronic systems that can wrap around highways, bridges, or office walls.Though the technology has been around for a while, most rectennas are made from rigid materials like silicon or gallium arsenide, according to Science Alert. The MIT team is the first to create a flexible rectenna that can generate a practical amount of electricity.The team's research was published Monday in the journal Nature. They are now reportedly planning to improve efficiency and build more complex systems.]]></videoDesc>

She had become trapped inside a broken elevator, The New York Times reports. Fortaliza explained to the authorities that she had been trapped since Friday evening. The owners of the house were reportedly away for the weekend.Fortaliza was saved after a person trying to deliver made contact with the property's owners, reports The New York Times.  They reportedly sent a family member to see what was going on. The family member then saw Fortaliza was stuck in the elevator and contacted the emergency services.Firefighters then made their way to the townhouse and forced open the elevator doors which is when the 53-year-old was finally rescued. Fortaliza was taken to a hospital for treatment, The New York Times reports.In a statement quoted in an Associated Press report, the family said Fortaliza had been  "a valued member" of their "extended family for 18 years."

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[COPENHAGEN, DENMARK  The BBC reports that Denmark is building a border fence to help protect Danish pigs against the deadly African swine fever.Denmark has started construction on a 70-kilometer long fence along its border with Germany, in an effort to control the migration of wild boars that may be infected with African swine fever.According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, the disease is caused by the DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family. Symptoms include high fever, redness on the ears, abdomen and legs, and diarrhea. In serious cases, it can cause death within 6 to 13 days.The Guardian reports that Denmark's electrified fence will be 1.5 meter tall, and at least 50 centimeters deep to stop boar from burrowing under.According to the BBC, there will be 20 gaps at border crossings and waterways, one gate every kilometer with steps elsewhere for humans, and 20-centimeter openings every 100 meters for small animals.Though African swine fever has not yet been seen in Denmark, the country has over 12 million pigs across 3,000 farms, and pork exports are worth billions of dollars annually.Critics say the fence is not a practical solution, citing gaps at roads due to the EU's open border scheme, and to wild boar populations that can swim across bodies of water.In Germany, the effectiveness of such a structure is also being questioned, since research has shown that the biggest risk of spreading the disease is through contaminated equipment and food.The Danish government is reportedly spending $12 million on the fence, which is expected to be completed later this year.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BEIJING  China reported that it had 15.23 million births in 2018, the lowest since 1961 when 11.87 million births were recorded, according to financial services firm Wind Info. According to the Associated Press, citing National Bureau of Statistics data, this puts China's current population at 1.395 billion for 2018. According to Business Insider, when countries fail to have enough children and have an increasing elderly population, the economy usually underperforms. China's one-child policy, carried out for more than 35 years between 1979 and 2015, resulted in an artificially slowed population growth that favored males. This has led to an over abundance of senior citizens with a shrinking young worker base to support them. Beijing is aware of the coming demographics time bomb, but so far has only used marketing and advertising to address falling fertility rates.]]></videoDesc>
