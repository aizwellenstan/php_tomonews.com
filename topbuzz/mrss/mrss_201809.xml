        <videoDesc><![CDATA[KNOCKOFF LAND  Drivers on China's Uber knockoff Didi have been banned from live streaming female passengers on China's Twitch knockoff Huya.Apparently there's been some public outcry after two creepy Didi drivers posted videos of their female customers  without their knowledge or consent. Ah, how romantic. Drivers are banned from live streaming any interaction with passengers such as prying into their privacy or endangering safety while driving," Huya said on its Weibo account. Weibo is China's knockoff Twitter. Looks like some Huya users/Didi drivers were live streaming their in-car conversations with female passengers. This comes days after another Didi driver admitted to knocking up a female passenger before he knocked her off. Looks like Didi drivers have been convicted of at least a dozen sexual assault cases in the past three-and-a-half years according to Chinese public records, so clearly the actual number is MUCH higher.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[AMERICA  With 17 states in the eastern U.S. under heat advisories, the hot temperatures along with the high humidity could be a health concern for some.According to Popular Science, when temperatures are high and the air is humid, the mechanisms the body has to cool down are not as effective.  Heat energy moves from warmer to cooler places. When outside temperature is cooler, heat leaves the body. But when outside temperatures are higher, heat can't escape as well. In high humidity, the air is full of moisture, so sweat takes longer to evaporate.As the body tries to cool down, blood is sent to the surface of the skin in order to radiate off heat. This pulls water out of the bloodstream and puts them into the sweat glands.Because of dehydration, less blood is available to transport oxygen to the brain and other internal organs. Circulation is encumbered as well because the blood has less water.    If those conditions maintain and fluids are not replenished, there is a risk of heat exhaustion. If someone appears to be confused, or starts to show other neurological symptoms, that is a sign of heat stroke.  Young children and older people are at higher risk for heat-related illnesses. It's important to stay properly hydrated in hot, humid weather. Wear loose-fitting and lightweight clothing. If possible, avoid direct sunlight. Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated drinks, which are dehydrating.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MYANMAR  Officials are investigating a ship that was found drifting off the coast of Myanmar, reports Fox News.The "ghost ship" was discovered by fishermen about 11 kilometers off the coast off Yangon, Myanmar.Officials say the empty cargo ship, named Sam Rataulangi PB 1600, was being towed by a tugboat, called Independence, to a ship-breaking factory in Bangladesh.In a Facebook post, the Yangon police said the ship had an Indonesian flag. The vessel was also reported to be more than 177 meters long, according to the Marine Traffic website.According to AFP, the bad weather caused the cables attached to the ship broke as the ship neared the Yangon River. This is when the crew decided to abandon the ship.Myanmar Navy officials decided to use coastal radar records to track down the approximate location of the two vessels, Fox News reports.Officials involved in the case are still investigating further, as the ship's last recorded location was reportedly off the coast of Taiwan before appearing in Myanmar waters.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CHINA  China has introduced robots into the classroom to teach kindergartners to tell stories and apparently to teach kids problem solving. According to the AFP, the Keeko robot is 60-centimeters tall and is equipped with tiny wheels and a large screen for a face. It only costs $1,500. The robots have been placed in 600 kindergartens around the country. Looks like the plan is to roll it out throughout China eventually and other Southeast Asians countries that are dumb enough to use it. When students answer correct questions or complete some challenge, the robot's eyes turn into "heart-shaped eyes." Yeah, that novelty isn't going to wear off in a week's time. However one of the principals of a kindergarten where Keeko is on trial said it will be sometime time before robots can completely replace humans in the classroom. Maybe they should replace the kindergartners with robots too. Think of how fast they would learn.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ATLANTIC COAST  Researchers on board the research vessel (RV) Atlantis have discovered a deep-sea coral reef about 160 miles off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. According to HuffPost, a human-operated submersible named Alvin was deployed from the RV Atlantis, and its cameras discovered enormous cold-water coral populations about 0.5 miles below the ocean surface.Scientists used Alvin to explore the reef and collect coral samples on Aug. 23 and Aug. 24. The team found large amounts of Lophelia pertusa, a branching, whitish coral found in cold waters. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), L. pertusa can survive in deep-seas by using stinging tentacles to stun its prey and guide food into its stomach.  The corals found by the Atlantis were located about 16 miles to the northwest of corals found earlier in the summer by the NOAA RV Okeanos Explorer. The coral-covered area explored by the Okeanos and the Atlantis run for an estimated 85 miles, layered with massive, rocky piles of dead coral likely accumulated over many thousands of years, according to expedition lead scientist Erik Cordes, reported HuffPost.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[USA  According to a study published in Science Advances, there is warm water trapped under the surface of the Arctic seas that could significantly melt sea ice in the Arctic.The researchers used old data from ships and new data from probes installed in the Arctic waters to calculate the "heat content."The warm water beneath the Arctic Sea is accumulating rapidly around 50 meters below the Arctic Ocean.As the sea ice started to melt, the water was exposed to the sun, and heated up.The Arctic winds then sent the warmer waters to the north, which is where they are trapped beneath the ice pack at present.Warm water is typically lighter than cold water, causing it to float. According to the CBC, the warm water doesn't float in the Arctic because its saltiness makes it sink. Instead, the colder, fresh water sits near the sea ice.However, the researchers warn the trapped hot water has the potential to "come to the surface" and "impact the ice."The researchers explain this could happen if the waters become so warm, they stop sinking and begin mixing with the cold, fresh water near the sea ice.The Arctic is already warning at twice the rate of the global average, this would only exacerbate the dire situation in the polar region.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA  A team of Australian scientists have observed wild dolphins learning a trick from a dolphin, reports The Independent.The wild dolphins reportedly learned how to tail-walk from a dolphin who had spent time in a dolphinarium.Billie, the dolphin, was rescued from a creek and sent to a dolphinarium in Adelaide, Australia.While she was at the dolphinarium, she learned the tricks of the trade by watching the other dolphins.To perform the trick, dolphins have to rise vertically out of the water and move across the surface using their tails, by either going forward or backward.When Billie was released into the wild, she began doing this regularly. This is when the other dolphins also started picking up the trick.The study found about nine wild dolphins performing the trick in 2011, although the total number of performing dolphins have since diminished.Dr Luke Rendell, co-author of the study, says this gives us "a revealing insight into the potential social role of imitation in dolphin communities."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[USA  The Ocean Cleanup, a nonprofit organization, has launched a beta cleanup system to collect plastic from the oceans, reports Forbes.According to the organization, there are about 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic on the surface of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which is located between Hawaii and California.The organization has come up with a cleanup system, called System 001,which consists of a 600-meter-long floater and a 3-meter-deep skirt to prevent the plastic in the ocean from flowing over it.System 001 would also take advantage of natural forces such as the wind, ocean currents and waves to propel the system forward and form a U-shape naturally to concentrate plastic in the center.The cleanup system is also fitted with solar powered-lights, cameras, sensors, satellite antenna along with anti-collision systems.A support vessel would come by periodically to take out the plastic gathered by the cleanup system, which would then be recycled and turned into products.This is just the first fleet; the organization eventually plans to launch 60 more fleets in an year or two.Some researchers worry the system might be harmful for marine life and could trap sea creatures as well, reports Business Insider.Meanwhile, others worry plastic parts in the ocean might be deeper underwater than the device can reach, and claim it might be a much more complex task to remove such pollutants.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Research into brain injuries suffered by U.S. diplomatic staff has been linked to suspected energy attacks on embassy workers in China and Cuba.The brain can perceive microwaves as sounds in a phenomenon known as the Frey effect. Over time, targeted microwave energy could induce head injury.A microwave weapon, according to the New York Times, could look like a satellite dish and may be handheld or fixed to a variety of transportation. Citing research, the New York Times reports that U.S. diplomatic staff in Cuba experienced intense high-pitched sounds inside their hotel rooms and homes. University of Pennsylvania brain expert Douglas Smith told CNN the injuries are like "like a concussion, but without a concussion" as patients had no previous head trauma.A senior U.S. administration official told CNN authorities suspect the injuries were caused by microwave beams, but added that they have no solid evidence.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LOS SANTOS  A Reddit user Propain58 said he met his partner, SubtleSwing, while playing golf on GTA online, all by accident.  How did they hit it off? According to Propain58, she dropped in, hit the ball a few feet and he cracked the joke, "Talk about a subtleswing".Prior to meeting up, Propain58 described how they verified that they were each the real deal. He writes that they were open and spoke with each other and each other's families via chat, Skype and phone. Propain58 wrote in the thread, "It's a bit safer bet when you can actually see the persons face in video and we were both fortunate that the other was willing to do things to prove we're legitimate people. That said a fair bit relied on trust in the other person and fortunately for us it paid off."Some users on the Reddit thread don't think the encounter is real. They find it all hard to believe, with some reckoning it's a marketing ploy by GTA creators Rockstar.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[YOUTUBE  Jake Paul is one of YouTube most famous stars. The problem is he makes horrible videos targeted at little kids.According to Paul himself, he makes videos specifically for children age 8 to 16, or 18-ish. In his videos, Jake constantly plugs his own merchandise. Sometimes he dedicates nearly half of his extremely long videos to buying his stuff. According to the Children Television Act of 1990 passed by congress, children's programming may not include commercials for products related to the program, or featuring characters from the program. So basically Paul is breaking the law in many of his videos. He also tells his young viewers to pester their parents to buy his merchandise. Another problem is Paul makes a lot of content this is sexually-charged or highly disturbing to young children.How much longer will YouTube let this go on? Probably as long as Paul keeps making them ad dollars.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ARGENTINA  Argentina has announced new austerity measures in a bid to stem its current currency crisis.This comes ahead of receiving a $50 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.  In a televised address, President Mauricio Macri said the country could no longer keep spending more than it earned.Argentina will slash spending and raise export taxes in order to tackle its budget deficit, The Guardian reports.The president announced taxes on grain exports and other products and said the nation will abolish about half of the government's ministries. The administration did not say which ministries would be closed or merged, the BBC reports.Argentina is the largest exporter of soy meal and soy oil and is also a major producer of corn, wheat and raw soybeans.Starting on January 1, those exports will be taxed four pesos for every dollar in value, while processed products will be taxed three pesos for every dollar in value.  The export taxes will be lifted once the economy has stabilized.  Argentina's goal is to achieve a budget surplus of 1 percent of GDP by 2020.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION  Russian officials have discovered a tiny leak at the International Space Station and believe it may have been caused by a human.The hole was discovered after Russian ground operators registered a dip in pressure levels in the space station, reports NPR.This led the crew to discover a hole, about two millimeters in diameter, on the inner wall of a Russian spacecraft attached to the International Space Station."The crew was then immediately instructed by ground operators to seal the hole with tape. They later used an epoxy-based sealant. This temporarily stopped oxygen from leaking from the cabin.No one onboard was in danger as a result of the leak.Originally the authorities suspected the hole could have been caused by a meteorite. However, they ruled out the possibility after traces of a drill sliding was discovered along the surface.According to the Russian News Agency, the Russian officials involved said they will find the person responsible for the accident and find out if it was on purpose or by accident.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[PHILADELPHIA  Last year, a viral GoFundMe campaign started by a New Jersey couple who raised $400,000 for homeless vet Johnny Bobbitt is apparently all gone. According to NJ.com, pro-bono lawyers for Bobbitt filed suit against Kate McClure and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico, alleging they were withholding the money raised to get the vet back on his feet.Bobbitt claims the couple spent the money on lavish trips and extravagant purchases. The couple claims they didn't give all the money to Bobbitt because he would have just blown it on drugs.  According to the Associated Press, GoFundMe says they are now working with law enforcement to make sure Bobbitt gets all the money that was raised for him. Bobbit's lawyer told the Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday that he learned the money was all gone in a call with lawyers for Kate McClure and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico. McClure and D'Amico started the GoFundMe page for Bobbitt in November 2017 after McClure ran out of gas on I-95 near Philadelphia and Bobbitt gave her his last 20 bucks for gas money. A judge has now ordered the couple to appear in court to explain where and how all the money was spent.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MASSACHUSETTS  Researchers have reached an important milestone in synthetic biology by carrying out successful trials on a group of volunteers in order to help treat people who suffer from phenylketonuria.The genetically engineered probiotic developed by Synlogic could become the first synthetic biology-based medical treatment to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according the New York Times. People who suffer from phenylketonuria, or PKU, must avoid dietary protein in foods like meat and cheese, because their bodies cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine, or Phe. The study, published on August 13 in Nature Biotechnology, showed that the probiotic can significantly lower Phe levels in both mouse models of PKU and in healthy monkeys, according to The Scientist. The treatment is called SYNB1618 and is a modified version of the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle. Researchers say treatment with SYNB1618 is a two-step process. The first step is to get patients' blood Phe under control. The second step is to relax the diet and slowly add natural protein into their diet.]]></videoDesc>

According to the Sun, Sienna Rasul became really sick the day after trying on a several new shoes with bare feet. Doctors think the bacteria may have been in the shoes. Sepsis can develop if bacteria enters the body through an open wound. According to the Mayo Clinic, sepsis occurs when chemicals released into the bloodstream to fight infection trigger an inflammatory response throughout the body. Physicians believe Sienna may have had a cut or wound on her foot that let the bacteria in.Little Sienna spent five days on an antibiotic drip in the hospital with her mom by her side. Luckily she's out of the woods and has been allowed to go home, but is still being monitored.]]></videoDesc>

We can't exactly put our nose on it, but something's snot right.Officers say a 17-year-old boy was just trying to keep his nose clean while walking through a suburb around 5 p.m. last Friday, when the suspect and his partner in crime robbed him.   According to the Metro UK, authorities blew the photo out over social media so see if the public could help pick out noseless suspect, but found a bunch boogers instead.  Two of funniest comments were probably, "I hope somebody nose something that can help," and this gem, "Surely somebody nose this man." Police didn't mention why the sketch was missing a nose, but they may want to think about sinusing up a new sketch artist.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI  A 55-year-old woman developed a case of black hairy tongue after taking an antibiotic for an infected wound.The case was published by Dr. Yasir Hamad, an assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, according to CNN. The condition refers to when papillae on the tongue grow longer than normal and turn black.Papillae are normally less than a millimeter long, but can grow to between 12 and 18 millimeters in length in patients suffering from the condition. The blackening occurs as the growing papillae trap microscopic food particles that allow bacteria and other microbes to flourish on the tongue. Black hairy tongue is an uncommon and harmless side effect of some drugs, but can also be caused by smoking, bad oral hygiene and some medical conditions. In this case, the woman was taking minocycline to treat a wound infection from a car accident. Within a week, her tongue turned black, she started feeling nauseous and developed a foul taste in her mouth. Four weeks after doctors changed her medication, her tongue turned back to its normal color.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SILICON VALLEY  U.S. companies are providing services to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on social media.As we've said before, U.S. Treasury sanctions, specifically Executive Order 13582 prohibit American companies from providing services to Syria without obtaining a license from the Treasury Department. Do they have a license? We don't know. They may well have. If they don't,  they could be breaking U.S. law.Bashar al-Assad's propaganda channel was removed from YouTube not long after we reported on it last month. Yesterday our further reporting Syrian government and media appearing on the platform garnered no comment from the U.S. government or Google, YouTube's parent company.The Syrian dictator has accounts on U.S. sites Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Syria's Permanent Mission for the United Nations links to Assad's Facebook and Twitter accounts  not to mention that now dead YouTube account and that Facebook page, links to the Assad on the Instagram.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TAMPA BAY AREA, FLORIDA  Toxic algae has wiped out droves of south west Florida's marine life.According to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, red tide algal blooms can produce neurotoxins which are lethal to fish.A red tide bloom 150 miles long was observed last month in South West Florida. It reportedly reached the Tampa Bay area over the weekend. The algae can also cause hypoxia to fish via oxygen depletion in water. It is deadly to birds, turtles, manatees and dolphins.Red tide can be harmful to humans if the neurotoxins become airborne, or by eating infected shellfish. Symptoms of infection can include coughing and irritated eyes, although individuals with respiratory conditions may suffer more serious problems.]]></videoDesc>

According to a paper published in the journal Science, the wind turbines could help to double the amount of rain in the region.The researchers say the wind turbines would work to mix warmer air from above and cooler air from below to create a "feedback loop" which would increase precipitation and vegetation growth.The large solar panel farms would absorb a larger percentage of the sunlight in the area, leading to cooler temperatures.The researchers also believe, the energy generated from the wind and solar farms could meet global energy demands.According to the author of the study, the plan "could help agriculture, economic development and social well-being in the Sahara … and other nearby regions.]]></videoDesc>

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, head lice is primarily spread by direct contact with the hair of an infected person. The most common way to get head lice is through head-to-head contact at places like school, home and outdoor sports or camp activities. Lice can also be spread when sharing personal care items like combs, brushes, towels and hats. According to the CDC, head lice should be treated with a pediculicide, a medication that kills head lice, that has an ovicidal effect meant to kill head lice eggs.]]></videoDesc>

The wooden statues of the Virgin Mary and Jesus, the Virgin and Jesus with St. Anne and St. Peter at a small church in Rañadorio were given quite a divine makeover, The Guardian reports.Apparently, one of the local residents thought the statues looked a bit drab, so she got permission from the parish priest to have a crack at them over the summer.Local shopkeeper María Luisa Menéndez told publication El Comercio, "I'm not a professional painter, but I've always enjoyed it, and these images really were in need of painting." Okay, maybe Menéndez might have gotten a bit carried away, but it's probably historically accurate that the Virgin Mary had turquoise hair. Experts aren't sure if the colorful paint can be removed, and the original polychrome paint recovered, the New York Times reports.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[JAPAN  A team of researchers from Shizuoka University plan to develop a miniature "space elevator" to connect Earth and the International Space Station with a cable.According to The Mainichi Shumbun, the researchers plan to develop an approximately 10-meter-long high-strength steel cable, with carbon nanotube being considered to be used as the primary material.They also plan to release a pair of satellites that would connect with the cable, and would measure around 10 centimeters on each side.The space elevator would be made up of six oval-shaped cars, which would be about 18 meters long and 7.2 meters wide.A camera would also be attached to the satellites which would record the elevator as it moves in space.The researchers expect the elevator to travel up to 200 kilometers per hour and carry people as well as cargo shipments into space by 2050.However, the researchers worry there might be problems such as the elevator colliding with space debris, meteorites or even the transmission of electricity from earth to space.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[STONYBROOK, NEW YORK  A young cancer survivor is still able to dance thanks to an innovative surgery. Delaney Unger, 12, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left knee in 2016, which would require chemotherapy and amputation of her knee, according to CNN. Because of the location of her Unger's cancer, doctors were able to perform a rare procedure called a rotationplasty. During a 13 hours surgery in April of 2017, she had her left knee completely amputated. Surgeons then took Unger's ankle and foot, rotated them 180 degrees and attached them to the stump of her thigh, according to Newsday. This allowed her ankle to function as a knee. In October of 2017, Unger received a prosthetic which fits over the backward-oriented foot and extends up the thigh. The prosthesis lets her walk, jump and dance.]]></videoDesc>

The previous method of transporting the fish by ground also reportedly took a lot longer than the current method.]]></videoDesc>

According to the Seattle Times, illustrations that go with the patent, which was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office in 2016, show a cage-like enclosure around a work space positioned on top of a robotic trolley. The company says it does not intend to use the technology, but said it was designed to allow humans to enter robot-only zones in Amazon's automated warehouses to make repairs or retrieve dropped objects. Amazon also said the system could be used to cut across an off-limits work space to reach a restroom. The reference to the cage transport system appears in a case study of the systems that make up Amazon's Echo ecosystem by Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler published on September 7.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[SAN BRUNO, CALIFORNIA  Two YouTube channels claiming to belong to an al-Qaeda-linked cleric have been found on the Google-owned platform by TomoNews.The man featured in both is Abdullah al-Muhaysini. According to the New York Times, U.S. government officials suspect he's in high within the ranks of al-Qaeda's Syrian group, the Al Nusra Front. He's accused of funding them, and, has been in Syria for some time fighting against regime forces. The U.S. claims he recruited 3,000 child and teenage soldiers for al-Nusra.One of YouTube channel claims to be Muhaysini's official YouTube channel. TomoNews couldn't confirm it was the real deal. TomoNews found another channel claiming to be one of his. Again, we don't know if it really belongs to him. Worryingly, this second channel contains a Jihadi training video. Looks like it's been viewed by 4,000 people and has been online since October 2016.Now we didn't see advertising on these channels, however, they're still on YouTube and that could be a problem for the Google-owned company. Muhaysini was sanctioned by the U.S. under Executive Order 13224 in 2016. This Bush-era law targets terrorists and their supporters. It bans U.S. persons from engaging in transactions and providing services to Muhaysini and several others named connected to the al-Nusra front.In other words, by this guy being on YouTube, they're technically providing a service to him. And unless they're exempt from those sanctions, that's against U.S. law. Sanctions have impacted Internet companies for providing services in the past. In 2012, when the New York Times reported that Syrian government websites were being hosted in the U.S., the State Department responded that providing services violated U.S. sanctions.In fact, the first channel we showed links to now-terminated Vimeo and Wordpress accounts. The Wordpress account says whatever was there violated their Terms of Service.A YouTube spokesperson told us by email, "We terminate accounts that repeatedly violate our Community Guidelines or that violate our Terms of Service and when we are required by law to do so." A spokesperson for the Treasury said TomoNews by email,"Treasury does not comment on investigations or possible enforcement actions, including to confirm whether one exists. However, generally speaking, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in most transactions with sanctioned individuals and entities."After we emailed both for comment, Muhaysini's channels were terminated. Both now display the text, "This account has been terminated for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[USA  According to the Washington Post, Facebook has announced plans to scan photos, videos, and articles uploaded onto the social media site in order to expand its efforts to combat fake news.The social media giant also listed a few examples of fake images found on the site such as a photoshopped image of a presidential candidate in Mexico and an out of context image of a girl in Syria.Facebook says it will be using an algorithm in 17 different countries including the U.S.Facebook will use reverse image searching as well as analyzing metadata to evaluate if videos or photos have been digitally altered.Once the algorithm identifies an altered image or video, Facebook will send the flagged posts to outside fact-checkers for further review.The new feature is equipped with "machine-learning" and was made to help reviewers quickly identify false content.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO  Officials in New Mexico are urging patients who have received "vampire facials" to get tested, reports ABC 7 News.The news comes after a client of the spa developed an infection, leading to an investigation of the salon.A "vampire facial" is a skin care treatment in which a patient's blood is drawn then reapplied to the patient's face.The procedure gained popularity when socialite, reality television star, and nude-selfie extraordinaire Kim Kardashian instagrammed herself getting it done.Officials reportedly found the salon had problems with storing, handling and disposing needles.The health officials suspect one way the infection might have spread is through "needle stick-associated transmission," which is a fancy way of saying infected needles.Health officials are urging anyone who received the procedure at the VIP Spa to get tested for HIV, and Hepatitis B and C.The beauty procedure is advertised as a way to improve skin health, reduce wrinkles and sun damage,  with apparently the possible side effects of contracting the HIV virus and liver disease.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM  Three species of translucent fish without scales have been found by a group of scientists in the Pacific Ocean.According to researchers from Newcastle University, the three fish have temporarily been named pink, blue and purple Atacama snailfish.  According to USA Today, they were discovered in the Atacama Trench, an 8,000-meter deep trench located off the west coast of South America. The fish can handle extreme pressure and are translucent with no scales. According to Thomas Linley of Newcastle University, the hardest bones in the fish are located in their inner ear to help them maintain balance and their teeth. "Without the extreme pressure and cold to support their bodies they are extremely fragile and melt rapidly when brought to the surface," Linley said in a statement.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  It looks as if Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a real big man crush for ancient Roman emperor Augustus Caesar."You have all these good and bad and complex figures," Zuck said in a New Yorker interview. "I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace."According to Zuckerberg, Augustus had to make choices, "that didn't come for free, and he had to do certain things." The Facebook king's Roman interests started in high school. He also named his second daughter August and spent his 2012 honeymoon in Rome. The New Yorker interview suggests the Augustus mindset could be why Facebook has pursued growth at all costs. This growth strategy also opened up Facebook to outside developers without putting proper safeguards in place to ensure user data was not misused  Cambridge Analytica. Looks like growth at all costs actually has quite a few costs, some that Facebook may not be able to afford.]]></videoDesc>

According to the Kansas City Star, Xavier Cunningham fell from a tree house after being attacked by a bunch of yellow jacket wasps on September 8.He then landed on the metal skewer, which went through his face and penetrated his skull, all the way to the back of his head. Xavier was rushed to a local emergency room, then transferred to another hospital, before ending up at the University of Kansas Hospital.  Surgeons were amazed that the skewer had missed his eye, brain and spinal cord. In a nerve-racking hours long surgery, the skewer was successfully removed. Xavier is now recovering in the hospital. His family has set up a GoFundMe page called the "Missouri Miracle" to help cover the medical costs.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CHINA   A post from a father mourning the death of his 24-year-old son, who suffered horrific burns at the Guangdong Xinhui Meida Nylon factory where he worked, went viral over Chinese social media a few weeks ago, reports Apple Daily.The man claims his son was asked to check an extraction tower without any protection when chemical water spurt from the tower, resulting in his son suffering chemical burns on 98.5% of his body. A warning system in place was reportedly faulty at the time.The father accused the factory for negligence, as they allegedly held meetings for an hour before they decided to send the young man to the hospital.He also accused the company, in an attempt to save money, of sending his son to a hospital where his injuries were incorrectly treated as if they were burns obtained from exposure to mere hot water.It wasn't until the family insisted the young man be transferred to another hospital, after days of the treatment not working, did the company apparently admit the injuries were actually chemical burns, and not the result of hot water alone. By then it was too late.Unfortunately, the 24-year-old passed away after 55 days due to a combination of ailments, including a lung infection and hypernatremia."And although his father's post went viral, it has since been deleted from Chinese social media.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[STRASBOURG  Last week the European Union got one step closer to neutering the Internet.Article 13 is designed to prevent copyright infringement via automated systems and filters. Critics say it's censorship by other means and that it'll end free speech as we know it.It's being pushed by German EU lawmaker Axel Voss. The man's official Twitter account has featured some parody in the past.A series of tweets labelled, "Turn of the eras in the digital age," from May 2015 show three satirical images lamenting the Internet.  In July, BuzzFeed Germany discovered a slew of copyrighted images on his Facebook and Twitter pages. Apparently, the Facebook images were deleted after the website reached out to him for comment.  According to a Google translation of the article, Voss or his staff didn't really tell the site if he had the right to use them.We've reached out to Mr Voss with some questions.  https://twitter.com/AxelVossMdEP/status/601461106742140928https://twitter.com/AxelVossMdEP/status/605037432833208320https://twitter.com/AxelVossMdEP/status/602773447207481344https://twitter.com/AxelVossMdEP/status/861669466161258496]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MADISON, WISCONSIN  Researchers have found that plants communicate distress by using their own signaling system. University of Wisconsin-Madison Professor of Botany Simon Gilroy and his lab have revealed how glutamate activates a wave of calcium that spreads across leaves to warn of danger. "We know there's this systematic signaling system, and if you wound in one place the rest of the plant triggers its defense responses," says Gilroy, according to the University of Wisconsin. "But we didn't know what was behind this system." "We do know if you wound a leaf, you get an electrical charge, and you get a propagation that moves across the plant," he added. The scientists wanted to know what triggered the electric charge, and how it moved throughout the plant. Calcium was one possibility, but the researchers needed to be able to see calcium in real time, so special plants were developed the produce a protein that only fluoresces around calcium. The team then subjected the plants to caterpillar bites, scissor cuts and crushing wounds and used video to track the responses.In response to each type of distress, videos show the plants lighting up as calcium spreads from the site of damage to other leaves.

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[EUROPE  The European Union Commission used memes in tweets over the summer to respond to questions if they were banning them under new copyright rules.If Article 13 of the EU Copyright Directive was law when they posted these, they could very well have been scrubbed by Twitter. This wants tech companies to filter out copyrighted content from uploads and websites via automation.That'll largely leave algorithms as the judge and jury of what uploads are copyright infringement and what are not. The EU guarantees freedom of expression, but can a bot tell the difference between a rip off and legit fair use of a work?]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM   The reason why there is an increase of spiders appearing in people's' home is because it is mating season from September until October, the BBC reports.Professor Adam Hart, an entomologist who conducted research on the behavior pattern of spiders and how they are affected during different seasons, found that 82% of the spiders seen in houses are male.He explained female spiders are usually seen in webs formed in garages or window sills while the male spiders generally wander around looking for a dry place to mate.Professor Hart suggested keeping doors and windows closed and keeping the house clean to deter spiders.The researcher also said the public should ignore "old wives' tales" such as using peppermint oil, citrus fruit and even ostrich eggs to prevent the spread of spiders around the house.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[US/PHILIPPINES  Two powerful storms have been causing destruction on opposite sides of the earth, one in the southeastern coast of China and one in the east coast of the U.S., but both have been wreaking havoc in different ways.Typhoon Mangkhut had winds of 165 miles per hour, compared to Hurricane Florence which only had winds of 90 miles per hour when it hit North Carolina's coast, according to the weather channel.However, Hurricane Florence was deadly in terms of the amount of rain it produced,  causing water damage.Typhoon Mangkhut formed farther south in the western Pacific where water is warmer, which gave the typhoon the "perfect environment to intensify."In comparison, Hurricane Florence formed near Africa, and was out of the tropics by the time it made landfall, which caused the hurricane to be weakened by the dry air in the region.Experts say that both are "storms of the same type," but those that occur in the Pacific west of the International Date Line are called typhoons instead of hurricanes.They also expect Typhoon Mangkhut to be the deadlier storm, as it has already caused death and destruction in the Philippines, and is now heading for China's southeastern coast.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[TOKYO  Experts are warning of a possible market crash as a now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange is set to finally payout its creditors.Fortune reports that in 2014, 850,000 bitcoins then valued at $473 million were stolen from Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox, in one of the biggest digital heists in cryptocurrency history.Mt. Gox has since filed for bankruptcy, but is now set to finally payout 160,000 bitcoins at current valuations to its customers.A former Mt. Gox trader who "spearheaded the investigation into the exchange's bankruptcy" told the Telegraph that it's likely those who get their coins back will want to immediately sell them off, potentially causing supply to outstrip demand.And with the value of bitcoin already plunging in recent months, there are fears that the flood of payouts could lead to a price drop that would ultimately crash the market.Mt. Gox customers who lost money in the heist can file their payout claims until October 22, after which coin distribution is expected to begin.]]></videoDesc>

On the show, Willman tricks a stranger into thinking he's invisible by getting all the people around him to already be in on the joke. Now the joke is being played on unsuspecting little brothers and sisters with pretty hilarious results  depending on who you ask.

A new study has found that chemicals in skincare products can negatively affect women's hormones, and may even lead to infertility or breast cancer.According to the George Mason University study published in the journal Environment International, beauty products often contain environmental products such as parabens, which are antimicrobial preservatives, or benzophenones, which serve as UV filters.Researchers collected over 500 samples from 143 women aged 18 to 44 who had no chronic health conditions and didn't use birth control.Analysis of the samples indicate that those with the chemicals present in their system produced abnormal amounts of the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone, reports the Independent.Too much estrogen has been linked to fibroids and irregular periods, but too little prevents eggs from maturing. Excessive progesterone, meanwhile, is associated with breast cancer and unusual vaginal bleeding.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[USA  A new study published in Current Biology determined BPA-free plastic products aren't necessarily safer.Twenty years ago, when the researchers conducted the experiment for the first time, BPA was found to give rise to chromosomally abnormal embryos in mice, leading the researchers to believe the same could be happening to humans.BPA was found to interfere with the endocrine system in the body which regulates everything from fertility to brain development.In this new study, researchers used BPS, a bisphenol which is used to replace BPA, and found the mice in the study all began to develop reproductive problems even though they were kept in BPA-free cages  similar to their previous study.BPA was found to affect the developing brain, heart, lungs, as well as other organs in the body.The researchers are warning the public about the dangers of different types of plastics used in consumer products as they could ultimately affect the body.A researcher involved in the study said plastic containers should never be put into the microwave or dishwasher because this causes the chemicals in the container to leak.]]></videoDesc>

According to Divorce Online, the online game has been named in over 200 divorce cases in the U.K. alone, CNN reports.According to the site, that's around 5 percent of the 4,665 divorces filed since the start of the year. But the thing is, Fortnite is widely popular all over the world, so the number of divorces caused by the game could actually be much higher. In June, the WHO listed gaming addiction in general as a potentially harmful tech-related behavior.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ST. LOUIS  A Missouri man suffered giant boils on his neck after contracting a rare, infectious disease from his feline friend.The 68-year-old had gone to the doctor after a weeklong fever followed by two months of painful swelling on his right of neck and face, according to The New England Journal of Medicine.The man's cat died two days before his symptoms began, supposedly from feline leukemia, though no laboratory testing confirmed this.Doctors now suspect a misdiagnosis, saying it may have instead been infected with toxic Francisella tularensis bacteria, which was likely transmitted to the man via bites or scratches while he was administering medication.The man later tested positive for tularensis and was diagnosed with glandular tularemia, for which he was put on antibiotics for four weeks.The painful swelling improved in just five days, and was completely gone in three weeks.Tularemia is more commonly known as "rabbit fever," since rabbits, hares, and rodents are especially susceptible. Pets typically contract the disease when they consume infected prey.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  Global warming is affecting hurricanes by making them wetter with more energy that intensify faster. According to the Associated Press, storm surges are more dangerous because of rising sea levels, with storms moving more slowly, thus increased levels of precipitation. The Associated Press spoke with 17 meteorologists and researchers who study climate change, hurricanes or both.Dean of the environment school at the University of Michigan Jonathan Overpeck said, "Florence is yet another poster child for the human-supercharged storms that are becoming more common and destructive as the planet warms."Several months after Hurricane Harvey, studies found climate change significantly increased the chances for Harvey's record rain falls. Scientists say that for every degree the air warms, it can hold almost 4 percent more water and feeds more energy into the storm. University of Exeter climate scientist Peter Stott said the warmer air and water also make storms more intense or stronger. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Jim Kossin and Overpeck also mentioned that studies have shown storms intensifying more rapidly than before.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[CHINA  Doctors in China discovered something unwelcome in a man's brain after he had an undercooked meal, reports The South China Morning Post.Apparently the man, identified as Mr. Liu, loved to eat grilled food, and was in good health until recent months when he suddenly started having epileptic fits.He went to the doctor and took a blood test, which is when they found out a tapeworm had taken up residence in his brain.Obviously the next step was to pull the thing out, which they did, all 10 centimeters of it, which is when they found out it was alive.Apparently the worm was springy and white and could swim.The doctors said the worm might have made its way into Mr. Liu's system after he ate undercooked or contaminated food.They also explained that the possibility of a worm reaching the brain and staying there is higher than finding its way to other organs, as the brain receives almost a quarter of body's blood supply.The doctors said once the worm is in the brain, there is a chance it could reproduce and further damage brain function, causing problems such as nausea, epilepsy and the bleeding from the blood vessels.Well, that's why you should be very careful of what you put in your mouth.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ALBERTA, CANADA  Commonly used household disinfectants and multi-surface cleaners could be making children overweight by affecting their gut bacteria, according to a study published on Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.  Infants living in households where antimicrobial disinfectants were used at least once a week were twice as likely to have elevated levels of the bacteria Lachnospiraceae at ages 3 to 4 months than children whose homes did not use disinfectants frequently, according to CNN. According to Anita Kozyrskyj, lead author of the study, higher levels of Lachnospiraceae in animal studies have been associated with higher body fat and insulin resistance. Researchers collected stool samples from 757 infants and analyzed their body mass index, BMI, at older ages in addition to parental use of disinfectant products.Scientists found that around 80 percent of Canadian households use disinfectant products at least once a week.  While the team found an increase in Lachnospiraceae with increased antimicrobial disinfectants, they did not find the same association in disinfectants without the bacteria-killing ingredients or eco-friendly cleaners. "These results suggest that gut microbiota were the culprit in the association between disinfectant use and the overweight," said Kozyrskyj, according to CNN. Though the results show connection between disinfectants and the gut microbiome, that does not imply causation. According to Kozyrskyj, further studies need to be carried out to establish a causal relationship.]]></videoDesc>

On average, we fart anywhere from 5 to 15 times a day, according to the UK's National Health Service.But say you're on that date and are holding one in. Then what? Apart from the obvious discomfort, the pent-up gas can get reabsorbed into circulation and emerge out of your mouth as gross fart breath, reports a study published in Digestive Diseases and Sciences.Hold it in too long and the intestinal gas could build up to a point where it just shoots out of you in a massive, uncontrollable fart.So next time you feel the urge, it's best to just let er rip.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[IPSWICH, UNITED KINGDOM  A family in the English village of Ipswich lived in constant terror after being tormented by the sounds of ghostly singing.The Ipswich Star reports that almost every night for nearly a year, a mom and her two kids were awakened by the disembodied voice of a little girl singing "It's Raining, It's Pouring."When the singing didn't stop, the woman reached out to the local town council. They found it difficult to believe, but nevertheless asked her to contact them the next time it happens.So when the singing started up again around midnight on September 12, she called the council, and together they traced the eerie music to an industrial building- being played through a loudspeaker.Turns out the creepy nursery rhyme was an alarm meant to stop thieves and trespassers, and was only supposed to be heard on the property.It was triggered by an over-sensitive motion sensor, and was constantly being set off by itsy-bitsy spiders crawling across the lens.The site has since apologized for the disturbance and adjusted the volume, which means the poor woman and her kids can finally get a good night's rest.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA    Researchers found that ingesting just one piece of plastic could increase the chance of a sea turtle to die by 22 percent, according to a study published in the Scientific Reports.The researchers found younger turtles have a higher risk of dying from plastic than adult turtles as they tend to float with the ocean currents where most of the small lightweight plastic lies.Adult turtles in comparison tend to be choosier with what they eat, choosing instead to eat sea grass and crustaceans.The researchers explained a even a thin, flimsy piece of plastic could block the intestine, resulting in blockage in the long run. While harder pieces of plastic could cause internal injuries, which could ultimately lead to death.The study also found that about half of the sea turtles on Earth have already consumed plastic.Dr. Hardesty, one of the authors of the study, said we should "rethink our relationship with plastic" and work to reduce the turtles' exposure to plastic.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LIVINGSTON,TEXAS  The mayor of Livingston, Texas decided to take matters into her own hands and shot dead an alligator she believed ate her miniature horse, reports The Houston Chronicle.Judy B. Cochran believes the 12-foot-long, 580-pound alligator could have eaten her miniature horse several years ago as it was much larger than other alligators in the area.She used a dead racoon as a bait for the alligator, caught it and hooked it up.After that, Cochran fired a single shot straight into the gator's head.The grandmother did receive some negative comments for killing the gator, but she believed it would have become a nuisance to another person if she didn't handle it.She promised the alligator wouldn't go to waste as parts of it would be prepared into meat for food, and boots to wear.Apparently, Cochran isn't the first in her family to kill an alligator. Her grandson apparently killed an even bigger alligator when he was just 5 years old.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[READING, UNITED KINGDOM  Microplastics could be entering the food chain through mosquitoes, researchers have discovered.This, in turn, threatens birds and other creatures that consume the flying insects.Scientists from the University of Reading fed microplastics to mosquito larvae, and discovered the plastics remained inside the insects after they became adults. The study was published in the journal Biology Letters on Wednesday.Researchers used Culex pipiens mosquitoes because of their prevalence around many global habitats. The team found the larvae consumed fluorescent microplastic particles that were 0.0002 centimeters in size.  According to The Guardian, as the larvae matured into the pupa stage and then into adult mosquitoes, many of the particles were transferred as well. This means that creatures that eat the mosquitoes  such as birds, bats and spiders  are also ingesting the plastics. The lead author of the study, Amanda Callaghan, a biological scientist at Reading told the AFP, although the research was carried out in a lab, it was "highly possible" this process was also occurring in the wild.  "It's a very major problem and those plastics already in the environment are going to be with us for a very, very long time," Callaghan said.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA  Taking a daily low-dose aspirin may have no benefit, or might actually be harmful to healthy, older adults, according to a new study. The study followed more than 19,000 people ages 65 and older in the United States and Australia for an average of 4.7 years, according to NPR. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Sunday. Participants were given 100 milligrams of aspirin daily or a placebo. According to NBC News, at the end of the trial period, 90.3 percent of the aspirin-treated patients were still alive, compared with 90.5 percent of those given placebos. The rates of physical disability and dementia were similar in both groups, while the rates of coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes were also similar. "We found there was no discernible benefit of aspirin on prolonging independent, healthy life for the elderly," said Anne Murray, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis, who helped lead the study, according to NPR. The study found a significant risk of internal gastric bleeding in the aspirin-treated group, as well as a slight increase in cancer deaths within the same group.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[AMSTERDAM  In an extremely rare case, four patients developed cancer after receiving organs from the same donor, with three succumbing to the disease.When doctors harvested the kidneys, lungs, heart, and liver of a 53-year-old organ donor, she had no known medical conditions, and no malignancy was detected, according to a case report published in the American Journal of Transplantation.Breast cancer cells were later found in the lung, left kidney, and liver recipients, with DNA analysis showing they came from the donor. The tree died after the cancer metastasized.A fourth organ recipient survived following removal of the donated right kidney, stopping immunosuppression drugs, and chemotherapy.The study suggests the donor has micro-metastases, which are groups of cancer cells that spread from their site of origin, but are too small to be detected.Organ donations are not allowed for anyone with an active malignancy, as cancer transmission can occur during transplantation.This rare medical occurrence, however, is believed to be the first case of breast cancer being transferred.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA  Scientists have found a way to successfully synthesize sodium as a viable replacement for lithium-ion in batteries.As the rare lithium used in most batteries is fast becoming scarce, scientists are looking into sodium, which is more abundant, and can service large power facilities at a lower cost, according to a Purdue University report.The problem with sodium is that it explodes when exposed to water. Sodium ions in a battery also tend to stick to the anode, building up into a solid electrolyte interface that can grow too large and hamper charging ability.To make sodium functional, Purdue University scientists used ultrasonic dispersion to melt it into a purple liquid. Once cooled into a powder, it is suspended in hexane for even particle distribution.A few drops of the suspension liquid on cathode or anode electrodes allows a sodium-ion battery to function with more stability, and at a higher capacity.According to Purdue assistant professor of chemical engineering Vilas Pol, adding in the sodium requires only minimal modifications to the battery production process, making it both promising and practical.]]></videoDesc>

The move would target grocery stores like Krogers, convenience stores like CVS and 7-Eleven, and big-box retailers like Target and Walmart. According to Bloomberg, shoppers use a smartphone app to get into the store. After scanning their phone at a turnstile, they can grab whatever garbage they want and walk out without stopping at a register. Sensors and computer-vision technology track what shoppers select and bill them automatically. Say goodbye to checkout lines  and human workers. Amazon is still experimenting with what it wants to offer at the Go locations such as a convenience store that sells ready-to-go meals with some groceries, or something like a fast food joint.]]></videoDesc>

The shift in Earth's tilt is what causes the change in  seasons.During the equinox, day and night will be balanced to about 12 hours around the world.The Autumn equinox usually takes places on September 22, 23 or 24 in the Northern Hemisphere.After this, the days will start to get shorter while the nights get longer as it enters the winter season.The term "equinox" comes from two latin words meaning equal and night.This occasion is celebrated in different parts in the world, with some cultures the event by spending time with loved ones.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[USA  Pandas are able to identify one another by their calls, according to a study published in the Scientific Reports.Pandas have a more than a dozen distinct vocal sounds they make but when it is time for mating season, there is a distinct sound that both male and female giant pandas use, a husky, rapid vibrato known as a bleat.The bleat helps to alert other pandas if there is a mate available in the area. It also contains information such as the size and identity of the panda.Pandas have a short mating season as the female pandas only ovulate once a year and are able to conceive for only a few days in an year, according to the New York Times.The researchers recorded the bleats of giant pandas and tested how well the sound would travel through dense bamboo thickets.However, the researchers found that the bleat works best if a potential mate is less than 10 meters away.The study could help conservationists trying to encourage pandas to breed as their population continues to dwindle.]]></videoDesc>

Carrie was featured on the program several years ago, and at the time had been drinking her own Number 1 for four years. If she's still at it, that mean she's been doing this for a decade.She apparently downs 80 ounces of her own Country Time Lemonade every day  sometimes by the glass, sometimes through her nose with a Neti pot. According to Fox News, one doctor said Carrie suffers from a type of Pica disorder where people enjoy eating inorganic things like dirt or wood.

She's eaten only small pieces of fruit since high school, and has become dangerously underweight as a result.The 26-year-old is so skeletal she weighs only 17 kilograms  the same weight as a 4-year-old child.Her plight got public attention after reality TV star Maria Kokhno started an online campaign to raise money to fly her to a specialist for treatment.Kokhno had previously battled with the disease, and arranged for Karyagina to see the same no-nonsense doctor who helped her get better.In one appointment, he brutally asked the girl if she ever considered playing a living corpse in a horror movie- an approach which may be working, since she's started to eat more than just tiny bits of fruit.It's but one milestone on a long road to recovery, but both Karyagina's mom and Kokho are hopeful that she will make it through.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[USA  SpaceX's Mars-colonizing Big Falcon Rocket spaceflight system has undergone a redesign.It will consist of two parts, a spaceship and a rocket booster, standing 118 meters tall at launch, 11 percent taller than their previous design, reports NBC News.Instead of placing six Raptor engines onto the spaceship, SpaceX now plans to add seven Raptor engines to power the BFR spaceship.The spaceship will also now include two movable fins near its nose and two larger fins near its tail. SpaceX's founder and CEO Elon Musk says this will help the vehicle maneuver its way to safe landings.The previous design didn't include any front fins.He also explained the vehicle will land like a skydive rather than an airplane, landing vertically after slowing its descent.Musk said he believes this design might be better than the previous one. He also added it "looks beautiful."]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ANTARCTICA  Scientists have proposed a crazy plan to build a wall around the Antarctic ice sheets in a bid to slow their collapse.As the planet heats up due to global warming, the world's ice sheets are rapidly melting and causing sea levels to rise at an alarming rate.To prevent this global catastrophe, scientists proposed constructing artificial undersea mounds to catch the ice as it flows forward, thereby allowing it to reground, according to new research published in The Cryosphere.A second idea aims to address the threat of warm water currents, which have been known to thin ice shelves.According to the research, building a long, continuous wall or sill across the front of the glacier will block warm water from seeping under the ice shelf.The study authors found that smaller structures would have a 30% success rate, and that larger walls may be even more effective.However, some scientists warn that such geoengineering is simply a band-aid for the real problem, and offers no real solution to reversing global warming.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[BOSTON  Popular low-carb diets like keto may be all the rage these days, but new studies have found that they may not be good for you in the long run.Business Insider reports that the ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low carb plan where healthy fats make up 80% of a person's daily calories, and protein 20%. Only 50 grams of carbohydrates are allowed a day, compared to the USDA recommendation of 225 to 325 grams.The idea is to go into a state of ketosis, in which the body burns fat instead of carbohydrates for energy.But while a ketogenic diet helps reduce sugar and processed food intake, according to a study of overweight men published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, it doesn't necessarily burn more body fat.Dieters tend to eliminate healthier carbohydrates like bananas, legumes, or oats, and with them nutrients like magnesium, calcium, and potassium. Some of the findings suggest going low-carb could lead to glucose intolerance or even diabetes, though more research is needed to confirm this.Research that looked at eating patterns of U.S. adults found that those who ate a moderate amount of carbs were more likely to live longer than high or low carb eaters.A third study that surveyed Europeans' eating habits revealed that those who ate fewer fresh vegetables, fruits, and nuts are more likely to develop deadly cancers.Diets sure are tricky. But it seems there's no big secret to eating healthy except for what we've been told time and time again: more greens, less meat, and no junk!]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS  The world's first fully-functional floating dairy farm is set to begin operations in the Netherlands. According to Business Insider, the three-level, 89-by-89 foot complex will be floating in the water in Rotterdam. The floating dairy will have 40 cows and can produce around 211 gallons of milk daily. The bottom level of the facility will house the processing and packaging machinery, with the cows and milking robots on the second level, while the third floor will grow clover and grass for the cows to eat.  According to Minke van Wingerden, co-leader of the project, who spoke with Business Insider, the farm will try to recycle as much as possible. Cows will be fed leftover food waste from the city. The cows' manure will be processed and sold as fertilizer. She also said the floating farm can be made to be hurricane-resistant. Van Wingerden said Beladon is currently in talks with another Dutch city for a second farm. She said they are also interested in opening farms in Singapore and China.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[EARTH   There are three reasons why our planet wobbles: glacial rebound, melting of ice and mantle convection, according to a study published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.Earth's shape and weight distribution isn't perfectly even, due to the mountains and glaciers on Earth's surface. Large glaciers, such as Antarctica or the Arctic, compress the earth which causes the sides of the planet to bulge outward.As the glaciers start to melt, the land would gradually start to regain its original shape. This process is referred to as glacial rebound and was found to only be responsible for about 3.5 centimeters of axis wobble each year.Scientists used to believe glacial rebound was the main reason why Earth would wobble.NASA found the melting of the ice, fueled by the release of greenhouse gases, accounted for one third of Earth's wobble.Mantle convection also affects the planet's spin as molten rock rises and falls and can redistribute Earth's mass.NASA says the planet's wobble will continue to increase as the combination of these three factors continue to affect Earth.However, they added the wobble isn't large enough to impact ecosystems...for now.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[FRANCE  France has begun removing 25,000 car tires it dumped into the Mediterranean in the 1980s off the French coast.The move comes after officials failed to restore marine life and instead began polluting the water. According to the AFP, beginning last week, divers and a specially rigged boat have begun hauling out hundreds of old rubber tires about 500 meters from the coastline between Cannes and Antibes. The original idea was to have the tires serve as a sanctuary for marine life and as a foundation for coral to grow. According to Denis Genovese, head of an association of local fisherman, talking to the AFP, sedentary creatures did not use them, while "grouper fish, conger eels and sea bream swim around them." A University of Nice study in 2005 discovered that the tires were leaching toxic chemicals, including heavy metals, into the water.Another concern now is that after 40 years, the tires will break down into smaller pieces putting nearby seagrass meadows at risk. In 2015, 2,500 tires were removed to show that the clean up could be done safely. Around 10,000 tires are scheduled to be removed over the next few weeks, with the remaining 12,500 set to be pulled in the second quarter of 2019. The tires will be sent to recycling centers where they will be broken down into smaller pieces to be used in construction.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[LAKEWOOD, NEW JERSEY  The internet went ballistic over the weekend after a baby was photographed crawling across a New Jersey street.The Lakewood Patch reports that Cory Cannon had been driving through Lakewood Saturday night when he spotted what he thought was a toy in the middle of the road.It wasn't until it moved that he realized it was a real-life baby crawling across the street on all fours.He immediately stopped his truck to block traffic, and snapped the now-controversial photo as proof before picking up the baby and calling the cops.A neighbor later came out and took the baby back to his parents, who only then realized their kid wasn't in the house. They say the whole incident was an accident, and that the tiny tot might have crawled out through an open door left open by an older sibling.Authorities are currently investigating what happened with the help of the New Jersey Department of Child Protection and Permanency.Still, there's no reassuring angry netizens, and the viral shot has since sparked a flurry of comments about bad parenting.Even Cannon is getting flak for snapping a photo before rescuing the baby, which he claims was only meant to protect himself as a black man in America.Had he picked the little dude up and drove to the police station, another driver might assume kidnapping and call it in  and we all know how that pans out.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[USA  Researchers have tested a new technique using electrical stimulation on the spinal cords of paralyzed patients to help them walk again.A device called the epidural stimulator was implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord, according a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.The device itself does not move the legs for the person, however it enables the neurons and nerves to be stimulated and receive signals the brain used to send before the patients became paralyzed.The device has the ability to be turned on and off by a touch of a button.The patients were also required to undergo intensive physical therapy along with electrical stimulation, and were taught how to train their bodies and minds on how to move again.A participant of the study says the stimulator helped restore functions of the body such as bladder control and regaining muscle mass. A researcher told The Washington Post, the study shows that the brain "has the capability of relearning to walk in the right conditions."The study was conducted with 14 paralyzed patients, with only three being able to regain the ability the walk.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA['MURICA  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says puppies are to blame for spreading a drug-resistant bacterial infection to more than 100 people across the country.  According to CNN, the CDC says puppies have caused more than that one-hundred people to become ill in at least 18 states from campylobacter bacteria.It's a common bacteria that causes diarrhea, stomach pains and fever. The main problem is that it is normally resistant to antibiotics. According to the CDC, puppies from six pet store chains between January 2017 and February 2018 were responsible for the outbreak. No deaths have been reported, but at least 26 people were hospitalized. Samples from all patients showed that the bacteria was resistant to all forms of antibiotics. Without treatment, patients normally recover from a campylobacter bacterial infection in around five days. According to the CDC, 95 percent of the patients say they had come into direct contact with a pet store puppy.    The CDC reminded the public to wash and sanitize hands before and after handling new animals.]]></videoDesc>

Locals say the woman also thought her husband was ugly, which only made things worse.Reports say the couple had only just patched up after an argument when the wife kissed him, and then deliberately bit off nearly half of his tongue.The man has since undergone surgery, but doctors can't say if he'll ever be able to talk again.His pregnant wife was later detained after her father-in-law reported the incident to the police.She already confessed to committing the bizarre act. But as to whether it was pregnancy hormones, long-simmering hatred, or just the crazies that pushed her to do it is anyone's guess.]]></videoDesc>

Officials plan to examine the artifacts and believe there is still more to be discovered at the site.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ONTARIO, CANADA  Doctors in Canada used 3D-printing technology to replace a dog's skull with titanium following major cancer surgery.According to an article released by the University of Guelph, a 9-year-old dachshund named Patches had a large tumor growing into her skull, pushing dangerously close to her brain and eye socket.Using an innovative new approach, University of Guelph researchers used rapid prototyping to print out a 3D model of Patches' head and tumor.This enabled veterinary surgeons to do a test run of the tumor removal, and create a custom fitted titanium plate to replace the parts of the skull that would be lost.Because of the technique, what would have been a lengthy surgery took only four hours, with Patches waking up just 30 minutes after the procedure.The procedure is believed to be the first of its kind in North America, and marks an advancement in veterinary medicine that researchers say can also be useful in human medicine.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[FINLAND  There is an alternative to patients with appendicitis who don't want to get surgery, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.In the past, appendicitis was considered a medical emergency, with surgeons removing the appendix immediately as they feared there was a possibility it would burst.However, the researchers found that nearly two-thirds of patients with appendicitis don't have to fear their appendix would burst and can choose to take antibiotics instead.Only 7 percent of patients who received antibiotics were found to have some kind of complications, with the authors saying the success rate for the antibiotic treatment was almost 64 percent.However, 36 percent of the patients eventually needed surgery to remove their appendix.The author of the study says antibiotics instead of surgery is a "feasible, viable and a safe option" for those who have an uncomplicated appendix, meaning they don't need to worry about their appendix bursting.In an editorial accompanying the study, the deputy editor of the journal said the treatment has a high chance of success, but that the public could also choose to get surgery if don't want to worry about appendicitis coming back again.]]></videoDesc>

According to a statement from an airport spokesman, "they were engaging with Ryanair staff at the gate and the male passenger was becoming agitated," BBC reported. Kehoe then started banging on the window to try to get the aircraft to wait  hold up  that didn't work? That's when Kehoe took matters into his own hands by breaking through a locked door and rushing onto the tarmac  with his suitcase under his arm  so he could chase the plane down himself. Everything was going according to plan until Ryanair workers stepped in and retrained Kehoe. Airport police showed up after that and introduced Kehoe to some pavement and handcuffs.Kehoe was charged with criminal damage to a door lock and granted bail. He was released on his own bond and is scheduled to appear in court again on November 8.]]></videoDesc>

According to KFGO, Myron Schlafman was making sausage in his garage on Aug. 17.According to AP, he went to remove a chunk of meat from the machine, when he accidentally stepped on the power pedal, pulling his left arm into the machine. Myron said the bone was severed but that his hand remained attached by some skin, nerves and tissue. Talking to KFGO, Schlafman said, "when my arm went in there, that must have been instant shock. I just looked and knew I was in big trouble. When I cut off my arm, I could feel my nerves jumping. If I would have hesitated, I would have stood right there and bled to death."Schlafman also credited two responding officers for saving his life by quickly applying a tourniquet. The 69-year-old Vietnam veteran was then transported to the hospital, were he spent nine days and underwent three surgeries. After his arm heals, Myron will be fitted with a prosthetic.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[HANOI, VIETNAM  In a twist absolutely no one was expecting, two contestants on the Vietnam version of the Bachelor ditched the titular lead and left to be together.If you need a refresher, "The Bachelor" is a reality dating show that has women compete for the affections of one supposedly swoon-worthy male.The rose ceremony is basically elimination night, where the man gives a rose to whoever he wants to keep on.But in possibly the wildest moment in show history, one woman confessed that she'd fallen in love not with the bachelor, but with a fellow contestant, and begged to leave together.Even more shocking is that she actually agreed, and went to return her rose. The emotional scene ended with both women walking away.Sadly, that love story ended pretty quickly. In yet another plot twist, Next Shark revealed that straightness prevailed and the bachelor managed to convince his runaway lady to come back and win his love.Female relationships springing from the Bachelor isn't entirely new. The Australia edition previously saw two women start dating after the show ended, though they've since broken up. However, it might be the first time a pair of ladies struck up a romance while still doing the program.]]></videoDesc>

        <videoDesc><![CDATA[ALASKA  Researchers have discovered a lake in Alaska that is bubbling due to methane emissions. Due to increasing temperatures from global warming, ground that used to be permafrost in the Arctic is now thawing and releasing trapped greenhouse gases into the air, thereby accelerating climate change. According to the Washington Post, Katey Walter Anthony, an associate professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Esieh Lake is bubbling because of methane gas.  The gases are geological in origin. The researchers say there are fossil fuels buried close to the bottom of the lake, and in combination with the melting of the permafrost, represent a source of greenhouse gases. The lake emits around two tons of methane gas daily  the equivalent of methane emissions from 6,000 dairy cows. Scientists will need to do further research to see if this phenomenon is occurring in other Arctic lakes.]]></videoDesc>
