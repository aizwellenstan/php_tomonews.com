      <title>New high-speed railway from Moscow to Beijing will take just two days</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Russia is reported to be building a new high-speed rail line that would take just 48 hours to travel from Moscow to Beijing, replacing the iconic Trans-siberian railway, according to reports cited by the International Business Times.Moscow has reportedly awarded the contract for a new Moscow to Beijing high-speed rail line to Chinese state-run railway company China Railway High-speed.The high-speed rail line looks set to replace the aging 9,000 plus kilometer Trans-Siberian railway. The new, roughly 7,000 km line will be around 3 times longer than the current longest existing high-speed railway line from Beijing to Guangzhou.According to reports the 8-day journey time of the old railway would be cut to just two days.Reports said that the new rail line has become a top priority for the two countries.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s biggest ship used to tear down oil rigs in days</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The world’s largest crane ship, the Pieter Schelte, can remove abandoned oil rigs in days, a significant improvement when compared to existing processes, which can take months, or even in some cases, years, according to a BBC report.The vessel measures 124 meters width and 382 meters in length, roughly as long as the Empire State Building is high.The ship is designed to install and remove offshore oil and gas rigs.To remove the top part of an oil rig, the vessel approaches the structure until it stands between its hulls. Eight arms then slide out from the ship’s decks and grab the topside of the structure, previously separated from its legs. To remove the rig’s jacket, or the legs supporting it, the vessel uses a pair of lifting beams, 540 feet in length. As the attached beams tilt up, the entire jacket can is tilted up and levered onto the deck, according to a report by Popular Mechanics.Allseas, the Swiss company that commissioned the Pieter Schelte, says plans to build an even larger ship are in the works.]]></description>

      <title>Captain takes control of UK&#x2019;s biggest-ever aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The commanding officer of Britain’s latest aircraft carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, has taken control of the vessel at Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland.“As a naval officer I always want more ships and more aircraft carriers, but I can't see in the foreseeable future two more ships of this scale being built in the United Kingdom,” Captain Jerry Kyd told the BBC.The 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is longer than the House of Parliament and has a 4.5-acre flight deck which is roughly the size of four football pitches.The Queen Elizabeth was designed primarily to carry the F-35B, which can take off on short runways and land vertically. It has two aircraft lifts, each of which can move two F-35s from the hangar to the flight deck in 60 seconds.It can accommodate up to 36 F-35B jets and four AW101 Merlin helicopters. In addition, it can also carry Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and Apache gunships.The carrier will begin sea trials next year and is expected to be deployed in 2021. Its sister ship, the Prince of Wales, is still under construction in Rosyth and is expected to be completed in 18 months.The carriers will be the second-largest in the world, after USS Nimitz-class carriers.]]></description>

      <title>Approaching asteroid, 2004 BL86, the largest to come this close to Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A half-kilometer-long asteroid will fly past earth on Monday (January 26), approaching as close as 1.2 million km from the planet, about three times the distance from earth to the moon. The asteroid, designated 2004 BL86, was discovered on January 30, 2004 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project in New Mexico.Monday’s fly-by will be the closest such a large asteroid has been to earth until asteroid 1999 AN10 passes earth in 2027. Asteroid 1999 AN10 is expected to pass the earth from an even closer distance of one lunar distance. NASA scientists say that asteroid 2004 BL86 poses no threat to Earth, but hope NASA will be able to learn more about asteroids from this event because of asteroid 2004 BL86’s relatively large size and close proximity during the flyby.The asteroid will be so bright and so close to earth on Monday night that even amateur astronomers with small telescopes or strong binoculars will be able to spot it. NASA scientists will observe asteroid 2004 BL86 by directing microwave beams at the asteroid and collecting the radar pulses that bounce back off the target. Using the collected data, NASA scientists will be able to determine the make-up of the asteroid and how the asteroid was formed, as well as what the asteroid looks like. It is likely that this will be the closest asteroid 2004 BL86 will get to earth for at least the next 200 years. If asteroid 2004 BL86 were to hit earth, it would create a crater of approximately 10 km in diameter, causing global firestorms, acid rain and an enhanced greenhouse effect.]]></description>

      <title>New class of potentially powerful antibiotic discovered by U.S. scientists</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S. scientists have discovered a new class of antibiotic that can kill many kinds of drug-resistant pathogens, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Nature.Many pathogens have evolved to resist antibiotics developed from bacteria that can be grown in labs. So the scientists developed the new drug, known as Teixobactin, by screening 10,000 bacterial strains from soil that cannot be cultured in labs.To grow germs from soil bacteria, scientists filled a device containing several hundred dotted chambers with cells from different bacterium. The device, which they call the iChip, was then placed in soil to allow the bacteria to grow.Once the bacteria were cultivated, they were placed in a petri dish and covered by a target bacteria, called Staph. Empty zones in the petri dish signalled that the bacteria below had released an antibiotic that inhibited the growth of the target Staph bacteria.The newly discovered antibiotic, Teixobactin, kills a class of bacteria called gram-positive bacteria by binding to the building blocks they use to construct their cell walls and causing the cell walls to break down. It is especially effective against bacteria that cause certain types of tuberculosis and pneumonia, and Staphylococcus aureus, which causes MRSA.Teixobactin, however, does not work against gram-negative bacteria, including bacteria that cause cholera and gonorrhea.]]></description>

      <title>Automakers fail to fully protect connected cars from hacking</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Automakers have done little to address a cyber security loophole made prevalent by ever more common wireless connections featured in new vehicles, according to a report prepared by U.S. Senator Ed Markey. The senator’s staff reached out to 16 automakers and inquired about their cyber security policies. However, only two of the responding companies said they could react “in real time” to a potential security issue. Nearly all new vehicles come with wireless communication technologies. Drivers and passengers can connect their smartphones to on-board WiFi and some rear-view mirrors allow drivers and passengers to connect their smartphones through bluetooth. GPS navigation has also become a feature drivers increasingly rely on.Taking advantage of security vulnerabilities, hackers can gain access to stored driving data, posing a risk to the privacy of drivers.Cybercriminals can even take control of a driving vehicle by, for example, activating its horn or tampering with the readings on its speedometer or oil gauge. In worst-case scenarios, drivers can even lose control of their vehicle’s braking system.]]></description>

      <title>Chinese spacecraft enters lunar orbit in test for Chang&#x2019;e-5 lunar mission</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The service module of China’s unmanned test lunar orbiter began orbiting the moon on Tuesday, state-run Xinhua news reported.The service module is currently flying in a 127-minute orbit at an altitude of 200 km above the moon’s surface. The module completed three circles around the second Lagrange point, or earth-moon L2, and left for lunar orbit on January 4. The module is collecting data for China’s Chang’e-5 lunar mission to be launched in 2017.Chang’e-5 is expected to make a soft landing on the moon and collect at least 2 kg of rock and soil samples. If the mission succeeds, China would become the third country to complete such a mission after the United States and Russia.China is reportedly looking to mine the moon for helium-3, a rare helium isotope that could be used to power clean fusion plants, according to a report in the International Business Times.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon submits &#x2018;pay by selfie&#x2019; patent</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Online retailer Amazon is employing ‘selfie’ technology to help secure purchases.The Seattle-based company has filed a patent application for technology that will soon allow customers to pay by taking a photo of themselves instead of keying in passwords.“As people are utilizing computing devices for an increasing variety of tasks, there is a corresponding need to improve the security available for these tasks,” Amazon’s patient abstract explains. “While many conventional approaches rely on password entry for user authentication, these passwords can be stolen or discovered by other persons who can impersonate the user for any of a variety of tasks.”The company hopes the technology will simplify authentication for its users.  When a customer is ready to make a purchase, the Amazon app will prompt the launch of mobile cameras and ask for a photo or video of the user completing a requested action. For instance, the app might ask a user to upload an image of him or her winking. It will then employ the special facial recognition technology to verify the user’s identity.The company’s abstract does note one potential hiccup: “Such a process provides only a certain level of additional protection, however, as the facial recognition process can often be spoofed by holding a picture of the user in front of the camera, as the resulting two-dimensional image can look substantially the same whether taken of the user or a picture of the user.”]]></description>

      <title>Study finds giant squid could be bigger than a school bus</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A new study shows the size of giant squids may be bigger than imagination, that they could reach the size of 20 meters in total length.The study analysed the data of beak size and the mantle length to standard and total length of the squid, estimating that squid can grow as big as 20 meters in total length, which is even longer than a school bus.The squid beaks are often found in the digestive system of sperm whales, which is the squids’ prime predator. “I am extrapolating here, and extrapolation can sometimes be a bit sketchy. But I think these are fairly safe extrapolations. I genuinely think that giant-squid size has been underestimated,” Charles Paxton, the author of the study and a fisheries ecologist and statistician at the University of St Andrews in Scotland told Live Science.According to Live Science, Paxton examined 164 measures of squid mantle length, 39 measures of standard length, 47 measures of total length as wellas 46 measures of beak or mouth size in relation to mantle length. The study was published in the Journal of Zoology.]]></description>

      <title>How to survive a rip current</title>
      <description><![CDATA[If you’ve ever gone swimming in an ocean, you’ve seen warnings about rip currents. According to AccuWeather, rip currents account for 100 deaths each summer in the United States. Swimmers who have been pulled offshore by rip currents often drown when they are unable to keep themselves afloat and swim back to shore.Last month, rip currents off the coasts of New Jersey and Long Island claimed the lives of three people within the span of three weeks. On June 21, a West Point cadet drowned off a beach in Southampton on Long Island while trying to save another swimmer who was caught in a rip current. On June 18, a 24-year-old woman died in Long Beach Township, New Jersey after being swept out into the middle of the ocean. And on June 5, also in Long Beach Township, a father died of a heart attack after saving his son from a rip current.Rip currents are powerful, narrow channeled currents of water, usually occurring near underwater sandbars, that flow away from the shore.They are strongest near the surface of water. Rip currents form when waves break near the shoreline. As water returns to the sea, a rip current forms to funnel the water back out.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, rip currents can be as narrow as 10 or 20 feet in width, although they may be up to 10 times wider. The NOAA advises swimmers who have been caught in a rip current to remain calm and not to fight the current. Instead, swim across the current in a direction following the shoreline. When out of the current, swim and angle away from the current and towards shore.]]></description>

      <title>LED street lighting may pose health risks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On June 14, physicians at the American Medical Association’s annual meeting issued guidelines on how communities can choose LED streetlights to “minimize potential harmful human health and environmental effects.”Converting conventional street light to energy efficient LED lighting leads to cost and energy savings, as well as a lower reliance on fossil-based fuels. But some LED lights can pose health risks.The American Medical Association recommends that outdoor lighting at night, particularly street lighting, should have a color temperature of no greater than 3000 Kelvin. According to the American Medical Association, LED street lighting has two problems. LED streetlights that appear white to the naked eye emit a large amount of blue wavelength light, which is estimated to be five times more effective at suppressing melatonin at night than the high pressure sodium lamps that have been the mainstay of street lighting for decades. Melatonin suppression is a marker of circadian disruption, which includes disrupted sleep.Blue light also scatters more in the human eye than the longer wavelengths of yellow and red. Sufficient levels of blue light can damage the retina. And LED light is concentrated, which can cause severe glare, resulting in pupillary constriction in the eyes.]]></description>

      <title>Experts say cyberthieves may soon start targeting our cars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A grim report on vehicle cybersecurity published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in March details the threats faced by drivers of both new cars and later-model vehicles. The various computerized gadgets inside modern cars may make driving safer, but also provide ample ways for hackers to target vehicles. In fact, the GAO report states that the more lines of code within a vehicle’s software, the more vulnerable it is to cyberattacks. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, a modern vehicle can contain as many as 100 million lines of software code  15 times more than a Boeing 787 Dreamliner.A hacker may gain remote access by breaking into a car’s bluetooth, radio and Wi-Fi systems. By doing so, the attacker could affect systems critical to driver and passenger safety, including the car’s brakes and engine.Once these systems are compromised, it may affect the car’s ability to maintain cruise control and the collision prevention feature, so that sensors on the vehicle can’t engage the brakes when they foresee a crash. Sensors that help keep the car within its own lane may also be impaired due to a cyberattack.Cyberattacks on vehicles won’t be happening immediately since such attacks remain difficult, according to the Washington Post. However, that doesn’t mean attacks on vehicles won’t happen in the future. Automakers and government agencies have already started working together to combat future attacks. Attacks could be prevented by securing communication between a vehicle’s devices, and firewalls could restrict communication between networks in case one system is compromised. However, while these technological solutions can be built into new cars, they can’t be installed in older cars, meaning that many vehicles will remain vulnerable in the short-term.]]></description>

      <title>Before Harambe shooting, gorillas had a history of protecting children who fell into their enclosures</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The 4-year-old boy who fell into the gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo isn’t the first child to find himself face to face with one of nature’s most powerful beasts.Harambe, a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla, was shot and killed on Saturday after dragging the boy around a moat because zookeepers feared for the child’s life.The incident sparked a public outcry and brought our relationship with these magnificent endangered creatures into focus. Critics who argue Harambe was in fact protecting the boy can point to two historical precedents to back up their claims, the New York Daily News reported.In 1986, 5-year-old boy Levan Merritt fell into the gorilla enclosure at Jersey Zoo in the U.K., breaking an arm and fracturing his skull, according to archive footage posted to YouTube.With the child lying unconscious, a male silverback named Jambo stood over the boy and protected him from other gorillas. Zookeepers and a paramedic then rescued the boy, and he was pulled out of the enclosure.In 1996, an unnamed 3-year-old boy fell nearly 20 feet into the gorilla enclosure at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. He was picked up by an 8-year-old female gorilla named Binti Jua, which had recently become a mother. Binti Jua carried the boy to a door in the enclosure and guarded him from other gorillas, helping paramedics to retrieve the child. The boy had a broken hand and cuts to his face, according to WGNTVWhile these stories have happy endings, the same can not be said for Harambe, as the uproar over the killing of the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla continues to be heard.]]></description>

      <title>1000-foot high &#x2018;Skyslide&#x2019; opens to public in LA</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A glass slide suspended 1000 feet above ground in Los Angeles has just opened to the public last Saturday.Known as the Skyslide, it is positioned between the 70th and 69th floor of the U.S. Bank Tower in Downtown Los Angeles. The U.S. Bank Tower is the tallest building in California and the 12 tallest in the U.S.The slide itself is 45-feet long and 4 feet wide. It is made of 1.25 inches thick three-ply glass. It was airlifted to the top of the building by helicopter before it was fixed to its position by construction workers using a complex pulley system.The slide is said to be able to resist hurricane-force winds up to 110 miles per hour and strong enough to hang two blue whales.“The Skyslide boasts a safe, thrilling experience unlike any other in the world. Guests of all ages will have the opportunity to transform their view of Los Angeles as they glide down, gazing at unparalleled views of the city,” Lucy Rumantir, President & Chief Executive Officer of OUE Americas said in a statement. The current price for one adult to enter the viewing deck and one ride on the Skyslide is $33.]]></description>

      <title>Watermelon snow is melting Arctic glaciers at an alarming rate</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A recent study published by scientists in Europe found that algae within Arctic snow is making the Arctic’s glaciers melt faster.“Watermelon snow” is triggered by a type of green algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis, which lies dormant during the winter under piles of snow.When temperatures rise above freezing in the spring, the surface melts and the meltwater bring nutrients to the dormant algae cells, stimulating germination.The cells then release green swimming cells with two flagella to propel them to the surface of the snow and daylight.The algae propagate further as more snow is melted. In order to protect themselves from the increased UV light, the algae produce a red carotenoid pigment that changes their colors to pink and red.“Imagine wearing black instead of a white T-shirt in the sun. It feels much hotter. It is the same for the snow: More heat means more melting.” Stefanie Lutz, lead author of the study and a geobiologist at GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences wrote to the New York Times in an email. Ice and snow have a high reflectivity, or albedo, but the red algae darkens the snow and causes it to absorb more sunlight, reducing the albedo of snow by as much as 13 percent.Scientists estimate that at least 50 percent of the snow surface in the Arctic will be covered by algal bloom during the summer. In addition to the Arctic, watermelon snow can also be found in places including Antarctica, the Himalayas and the Rocky Mountains.]]></description>

      <title>Microsoft creates new smart mirror that can read human emotions</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Microsoft unveiled a smart mirror at a technology conference held in Singapore last month that allows users to view both their reflections and relevant information like the time, weather and traffic directions.Microsoft's Magic Mirror is a one-way mirror with a 23.6-inch LCD-lit screen behind it that displays white UI elements on a dark background. The device runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 microcomputer and uses Windows Hello technology to conduct facial recognition.The Magic Mirror’s facial recognition system can recognize eight different emotions, including anger, happiness and surprise. Microsoft’s Cognitive Services Face API matches a person’s face to their profile, and allows the mirror to display information relevant to that person’s mood. Besides displaying information like the time and the weather, the mirror would also be able to tap into the Internet of Things and provide information like the fastest route to work.The facial recognition feature could also provide real-time information to advertisers on how people are reacting to an advertisement displayed on the smart mirror, Izzat Khair, a member of Microsoft Singapore’s development team, told CNBC.The mirror is still in its demo stage and no commercial release date has been announced, but Microsoft has released the application source code and bill of materials for the device on GitHub for those interested in building one for themselves.]]></description>

      <title>Smart tampons allows you to detect STDs at home</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A U.S. startup company called NextGen Jane is developing smart tampons that can let users test themselves for STDs and other reproductive illnesses.“I was trying to develop a way for women to monitor their own fertility at home, and those kinds of diagnostic tests require a lot of blood. So I was thinking about women and blood. When you put those words together, it becomes obvious. We have an opportunity every single month to collect blood from women, without needles,” Ridhi Tariyal, a Harvard graduate and the CEO of NextGen Jane told the New York Times.Menstrual blood contains cells from the ovaries and uterus. NextGen Jane uses a 3D-printed prototype that extracts the blood from a tampon before medical tests are conducted outside the body.The tests may be able to detect chlamydia, a disease that blocks the fallopian tubes and prevents fertilization. The device can also test for the human papilloma virus, which causes genital warts and cervical cancer.  The company is also experimenting with testing the genomic changes in menstrual blood to examine polycystic ovarian syndrome, uterine fibroids and endometriosis, which is traditionally diagnosed by laparoscopic surgery.The company is currently conducting clinical trials and a final product is expected to be completed in the next year.]]></description>

      <title>Fish found to prefer eating microplastic over plankton</title>
      <description><![CDATA[About 8 million tonnes of plastic are leaked into the ocean annually, and its impact on the fragile underwater ecosystem has scientists worried.The BBC reports that a new study from Sweden’s Uppsala University has found that young fish are eating microplastic like junk food  and it’s killing them.Microplastic particles result from the fragmentation of large plastic waste, or from tiny manufactured plastic, such as microbeads in cosmetic products. Measuring less than 5 millimeters across, the particles flow through waterways and into the ocean, accumulating in shallow coastal areas.Larval perch that normally feed on plankton have been found to be actively choosing the microplastic as food. This has resulted in their stunted growth and sudden disregard for the smell of predators. The ability to respond to the smell of predators and flee is typically innate in young fish.When placed in tanks with their natural predator, perch that ate plastic were preyed upon four times faster than those that did not. All were dead within 48 hours, reports the Deccan Chronicle.Scientists warn that the harmful effects of plastic is not limited to fish, and may be felt throughout the food chain.The study, published in the journal ‘Science’, is an important step in understanding the silent threat that plastic wastes poses on marine creatures.According to Chemistry World, the U.S. has already put a ban on the production of microbeads in personal care products, effective July 2017. Pressure is building for other countries, especially in Europe, to follow suit.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ever wondered where the flight attendants or even pilots rest during those long haul flights? Here are the secret rest spots for the crew on a plane.On a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the flight crew rest cabin is usually positioned behind the cockpit and above the first class compartment.The stairway to the flight crew rest cabin is disguised behind a security-coded door. The cabin usually has one business class seat and two bunk beds, separated by thick curtains to give the pilots a small amount of privacy.The rest cabin for flight attendants is usually located at the rear of the plane and just above the economy passenger compartment. Depending on the design of each plane, but a compartment can usually accommodate at least five flight attendants.Even though some crew members complain that it feels like sleeping in a coffin, other people are wondering if similar rest cabins can be designed for passengers as well.]]></description>

      <title>Nonprofit hopes to build a permanent colony on Mars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The race to Mars has begun. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has announced that the company will send people to the red planet by 2024 and that he would reveal plans for colonization in September, the Los Angeles Times reported.Meanwhile, a nonprofit group also aims to establish permanent Mars colonies, sending the first group of astronauts by 2026.After Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system. It has similar natural resources, a temperate climate and an adaptable gravitational pull on its surface. Mars One  a non profit foundation founded in 2011 with a team of ambassadors and advisors including an astronaut, Nobel Prize laureate and the former NASA Chief Technologist  has developed a mission plan to colonize Mars. Mars One has already selected six teams of four individuals. The first team will begin training next year, according to the Mars One website.In 2020, Mars One will launch a communications satellite to the red planet. Between 2022 and 2025, a series of rovers will land and assemble the habitats. The colony will have livable habitats, a life support unit and a communications system.The Living Unit will house an inflatable living section and an airlock used by astronauts when leaving the sealed, habitable settlement. The unit will include materials for the construction of rooms, floors and electrical outlets, and comes equipped with shower and kitchen areas. Additional units will arrive and be constructed as new teams join the colony.The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is rigged with extra technologies which capitalize on the natural resources available on Mars. Thin film solar photovoltaic panels will be included to generate electricity. The ECLSS will be equipped with heating units to boil and extract water from ice in the planet’s soil, according to the Mars One website.The ECLSS will be connected to the Living Unit through a tube which will feed nitrogen and argon gas, extracted from Mars’ atmosphere, into the habitable space as inert gases. Once the astronauts have landed, it will also be in charge of the water purification and removal of waste gas such as carbon dioxide from the Living Unit atmosphere.The Mars colony’s communication system will involve two orbiting satellites: one around Mars and one around the sun. The satellite orbiting Mars will only be interrupted when Mars is positioned between it and Earth. To counter the lapse, the second satellite orbiting the sun will intercept and relay the transmission, allowing almost 24/7 communication with Earth. The colony will lose transmission only when the sun is between Mars and Earth and Mars is between its satellite and Earth simultaneously. Mars One will launch a team of four every two years starting in 2026. It will take a year after departing Earth for a team to land on the surface of Mars. The organization hopes to train and send new teams, even after the initial six have colonized the planet.]]></description>

      <title>Magma build-up under New Zealand town could signal start of volcano formation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Scientists using GPS data and satellite images claim to have found a huge buildup of magma under a town in New Zealand.The researchers say there is enough magma located 10 kilometers beneath the town of Matata on New Zealand’s North Island to fill 80,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, according to a study published in the journal Science Advances.The scientists say the magma has caused a 400-square-kilometer area in the Taupo Volcanic Zone to rise 40 centimeters since 1950, and probably also triggered thousands of small earthquakes in recent years that were previously attributed to tectonic shifts.The magma could cause a volcano to form, but the process would take hundreds or thousands of years.

      <title>Scientists aim to grow human organs in pigs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A team of scientists from the University of California, Davis are attempting to produce human-pig embryos in order to grow human organs in pigs.To grow a human organ such as a pancreas in a pig, one must first remove the DNA that is responsible for growing a pig pancreas from a fertilized pig embryo using a technique known as CRISPR gene editing.A void is created after the gene editing, and human induced pluripotent stem cells are then injected into the embryo to fill up the void. Human induced pluripotent stem cells are adult cells that have been reprogrammed into stem cells. They can develop into any tissue in the human body, including corneas, lungs, hearts, livers and kidneysThe human-pig embryo, known as a chimera, is then implanted into a sow and is allowed to develop for 28 days. Then the pregnancy is terminated and the tissue removed for analysis.“Our hope is that this pig embryo will develop normally but the pancreas will be made almost exclusively out of human cells and could be compatible with a patient for transplantation,” Pablo Ross, lead researcher on the project and assistant professor at the Department of Animal Science at UC Davis told the BBC.However, the idea of growing human-pig embryos remains highly controversial, with the U.S. National Institutes of Health imposing a moratorium on funding such experiments. Ross told the BBC that the main concern is that the human stem cells might migrant to develop in the pig embryo's brain, which would make the pig somewhat human-like.Others are worried that growing human organs in pigs may lead to a new source of animal abuse, despite the fact that it may help to ease the shortage in organ donations in the U.S.]]></description>

      <title>Mosquitoes use six needles to suck blood and leave saliva that spreads viruses like Zika</title>
      <description><![CDATA[An outbreak of the Zika virus is giving scientists added impetus to understand how mosquitoes are so effective at biting us and passing on disease.As of last month, 48 countries and territories had reported active Zika outbreaks, according to Reuters. Infection with the virus in pregnant women causes the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies.Scientists at the University of California, Davis, hope research into how mosquitoes bite us will lead to new repellents that can arrest the spread of viruses like Zika, NPR reported.Researchers told NPR that the mouth of a mosquito has a sheath that protects six needle-like mouthparts, known as stylets.When a mosquito bites, the sheath moves backwards, and two stylets lined with tiny, sharp teeth saw through the skin. As these maxillae cut through the skin, two mandibles thrust into the tissue and hold it apart.Another needle, called the hypopharynx, drips mosquito saliva into the skin to keep blood flowing, causing an itchy welt to form and spreading diseases like Zika.Receptors in a sixth needle, the labrum, help guide it to a blood vessel. Blood is then sucked up through the labrum like a straw. As blood fills the mosquito’s gut, it filters and excretes the water content to absorb more nutritious red blood cells.Public health experts recommend using insect repellent, checking screens on doors and removing standing water around homes to reduce the spread of mosquito-borne viruses, according to NPR.]]></description>

      <title>Plague detected in flea on chipmunk near California&#x2019;s Lake Tahoe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Visitors to California’s Lake Tahoe have been warned to stay away from rodents after plague was detected in the area.Health officials said a flea taken from a chipmunk in the South Lake Tahoe area on May 18 tested positive for plague on June 2, USA Today reported. The disease is perhaps best known as the deadly bacterial infection which killed millions of Europeans in the 14th century during the Black Death.Plague is naturally present in California. It is spread by rodents including squirrels and chipmunks, and their fleas, according to CBS News.Humans can contract the disease through close contact with an infected rodent, or a flea bite. The disease can be fatal if not caught early and treated with antibiotics.Symptoms usually occur within two weeks of initial contact, and include fever, nausea, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes.Plague is most commonly found in rural areas of the western United States. An average of seven human cases are reported each year, CBS News reported, citing the Centers for Disease Control.Warning signs have gone up near the Fallen Leaf Campground in South Lake Tahoe, where the plague-carrying flea was taken from, according to CBS News.Health officials advised visitors to cover up, wear insect repellent, and keep pets at home, CBS News reported.Two people were infected with plague in California last year after exposure to rodents in Yosemite Valley, according to CBS News.]]></description>

      <title>Gulf of Mexico &#x2018;dead zone&#x2019; to be as big as Connecticut</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S. researchers forecast the annual summer hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico to be roughly the same size as Connecticut.The hypoxic region known as “dead zone” forms after the Mississippi River flows downstream from farmland across the central U.S. into the Gulf of Mexico during the spring and early summer.The water contains high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus which triggers the algae growth.Algae sink to the bottom when they die, where they decompose and consume the oxygen in the water.The nutrient-rich water stays on top of the Gulf water, blocking oxygen from getting into the bottom of the water unless stirred by a tropical storm or hurricane.The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force tried to reduce the extent of the Gulf hypoxic zone to 1,950 square miles by 2015, but has made little progress so far.“And while the latest forecast calls for an average-size dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, it is important to recognize that these averages are unacceptable. The bottom line is that we will never reach the action plan's goal of 1,950 square miles until more serious actions are taken to reduce the loss of Midwest fertilizers into the Mississippi River system,” Don Scavia, aquatic ecologist and director of the Graham Sustainability Institute at the University of Michigan said in a statement.]]></description>

      <title>California startup set to get approval for first private mission to the moon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A California space startup is poised to gain government approval for the first private mission to the moon.Moon Express, a startup from Mountain View, California, is reportedly on the verge of U.S. approval to land on the moon in 2017. The green light would pave the way for commercial ventures outside Earth’s orbit.In October, the startup announced a contract with Rocket Lab USA for multiple lunar missions between 2017 and 2020, and has been working to clear federal approval to send its MX-1 lander to the moon. The small vehicle would deliver scientific hardware to the lunar surface.The company hopes to be able to send a series of robotics to the moon for further exploration and the harvesting of resources. Moon Express’ MX-1 lander consists of a solar panel, pressurant tanks and a payload deck. The unmanned launches  three of which are firmly on the books, with the other two optional at the moment  will send the MX-1 lander into space aboard Rocket Lab’s 52.5-foot-tall (16 meters) Electron rocket. The goal is to test out the MX-1 and its systems, making sure the spacecraft can land softly on the moon, move about the lunar surface, grab samples and return them to Earth.Moon Express is looking to discover and mine resources from the moon including platinum, titanium and other rare materials, including helium-3.Helium-3 is a light, non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron, in contrast with two neutrons in common helium. A unique aspect of helium-3 is, in nuclear fusion reactions, it produces clean energy. As opposed to nuclear fission, which splits an atom's nucleus in half, nuclear fusion combines nuclei to produce energy. While nuclear fusion has already been tested with the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, those reactions give off the majority of their energy as unsafe radioactive neutrons. Helium-3, on the other hand, is perfectly safe. A reaction that uses two atoms of helium-3 to create helium and two protons doesn’t produce any pollution or radioactive waste and poses no danger to surrounding areas.Helium-3 doesn’t occur naturally on Earth, but it has been emitted from the sun for billions of years and has been accumulating on the lunar surface.Just 2.2 pounds (one kilogram) of helium-3 combined with 1.5 pounds (0.67 kilograms) of deuterium produces 19 megawatt-years of energy. Roughly 25 tons of the stuff could power the United States for an entire year.If Moon Express is successful, not only would the company pave way for for-profit businesses to take advantage of space resources, the startup would also be placed in a position to win the Google Lunar XPRIZE, a $30 million competition to land a privately funded robotic spacecraft on the moon by the end of 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Network of medieval cities discovered beneath jungle in Cambodia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A vast network of previously undocumented medieval cities has been discovered near Cambodia’s Angkor Wat temple.Researchers using LIDAR scanning technology found multiple cities beneath the jungle, the Guardian reported.The cities had complex urban landscapes and were linked by roads and canals. They range from 900 to 1,400 years old and would have been part of the largest empire on earth in the 12th century.LIDAR is a detection system similar to radar, which uses lasers instead of radio waves. It is used with GPS to produce 3D models and maps.Last year, a helicopter mounted with LIDAR technology scanned a 734-square-mile area near Angkor Wat, according to the Guardian.The data revealed the true scale of the lost city of Mahendraparvata, which was previously believed to be much smaller. In fact, Mahendraparvata was about the same size as Cambodia’s present capital Phnom Penh.The scans show the ancient cities had sophisticated water management systems built hundred of years before it was believed the technology existed, the Guardian reported. Geometric shapes thought to be gardens were also discovered.Historians told the Guardian the groundbreaking discovery would help us understand more about Angkorian civilization and the decline of the Khmer empire.]]></description>

      <title>Danish company creates hugging machine for people with Autism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A Denmark-based company has developed a hugging machine called OrbisBox to help calm people with autism.The device is 163 centimeters tall, 85 cm wide and 223 cm in length. It can be transported to different locations and contains side plates covered with polyurethane foam.The device is said to be a commercial model based on Dr. Temple Grandin’s invention of the “hug machine.” Dr. Grandin is a world renowned spokesperson for autism, who created the device when she in college.Once the user is inside the OrbisBox, the side plates will start to move in and press against them, mimicking the sense of a hug. The weight of the pressure can be adjusted from 10 kg to 30 kg.The box has built-in speakers to play soothing music. Lighting can also be changed to make the user feel more relaxed.Autism is a complex brain development disorder which scientists say likely affects boys five times more than it does girls. Signs of autism may include difficulties in social interaction, strange attachment to objects and unawareness to danger.Due to their hypersensitivity, people with autism are often uncomfortable or unable to seek comfort from other people.Autism is a growing developmental disorder in the U.S. that it currently affects roughly 2 percent of teenage boys, or 1 in 42 boys, according to Autism Speaks.]]></description>

      <title>Rolls-Royce develops fleet of autonomous ships</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Rolls-Royce has unveiled plans for a fleet of unmanned, remote controlled ship to hit the seas in 2020.The Advanced Autonomous Waterborne Applications (AAWA) Initiative, led by Rolls-Royce, is a €6.6 million project funded by Tekes (Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation) that will provide preliminary specifications and designs for next generation advance ships.To begin, the ships will carry freight and be controlled from a central control center by a small crew of seven to 14 people. The crew will use interactive smart screens, voice recognition systems, holograms and surveillance drones to monitor what is happening both on board and around the ships. The ships can operate in two main modes: remote control and autonomous mode. When in remote control, ships can be controlled using a device similar to a joystick. In this mode, the operator controls speed and direction and is privy to the boat’s relative position to objects nearby.When in autonomous mode, ships will execute planned missions, like navigating to the next waypoint, on their own. In this mode, the operator is limited to receiving data such as location, speed, headway and ETA to end point. In this mode, operators are able to monitor more ships at one time. Additionally, more information will be provided should a ship stray from its original plan due to unforeseen circumstances. Different levels of operator interaction will be requested depending on various scenarios. In a white paper published in June, researchers concluded that drone ships should operate on a hybrid of both remote control and autonomous mode. The technology required to create such ships are already in existence. Currently, researchers are working on a concept demonstration to be completed by 2017 and a full scale development for commercial use to be completed by 2020.]]></description>

      <title>How shark repellant wristbands work</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Sharks are widely feared as the ocean’s deadliest predator, but advancements in shark repellent technology are making the water a safer place for divers and surfers.Scientists in New Jersey have developed Sharkbanz, wrist and ankle bands that utilize the magnetism of the Earth to ward off inquisitive sharks. Sharks have receptors, located in their facial region, that allow them to detect electromagnetic energy. They have the most sensitive electromagnetic sense of all known animals. Sharks use this unique advantage to judge distance, shape, as well as heart rate in other animals. Sharkbanz do not require batteries, as they draw power from the magnetic field of the Earth. As a shark swims within one to two meters away, magnetic waves coming from the band disrupt its electro-receptors. When submerged in water, it is advised that divers place the band over their wrists, so they can direct the magnetism when sharks swim towards them. The technology has been proven to repel small creatures such as the nurse shark and southern stingray, as well as the more aggressive, predatory-type animals such as tiger sharks and bull sharks, who are known for their attacks on people.Sharkbanz aren’t likely to protect band-wearers from the advances of great whites, as those sharks tend to be ambush predators who attack their prey from long distances at high speeds. However, if one happens to be casually investigating, it may very well deter them from further inquiry.]]></description>

      <title>ATM skimming - how to spot ATM skimmers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This animation explains the practice of automatic teller machine (ATM) skimming, a common form of fraud that involves a compromised ATM that allows criminals to access bank accounts. According a survey published in April 2016, such incidents increased 546% from 2014 to 2015 in the United States. The data came from financial analytics company FICO and FICO Card Alert Service software, which also states that 60% of the incidents took place at non-bank ATMs.ATM skimming usually employs two separate components. First, a fake card reader is fitted onto the ATM’s card slot. It scans and stores the information on the card’s magnetic strip as it slides through.Then, a pinhole camera hidden on or near the ATM records the PIN entered on the keypad. Alternatively, a fake keypad is placed on top of the real one to record the digits entered.To avoid becoming victim to skimming fraud, one must check for any objects mounted on the ATM or near it.  Comparing the ATM being used to another nearby can help spot suspicious differences. Examine any mounted parts by pulling them to see whether they are securely attached. Feel the keypad for its sensitivity and check whether it was placed on top of a real one.The research also reports that 60% of incidents took place at non-bank ATMs. You might want to avoid using ATMs in malls, for instance, and stick with those located outside or inside your bank.According to PCMag, one should examine any mounted parts by pulling them to see if they are securely attached.

      <title>Jupiter&#x2019;s great red spot heats planet&#x2019;s atmosphere</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Mankind is beginning to unravel the mysteries of our solar system’s biggest planet, starting with its atmosphere.Reuters reports that Jupiter’s atmosphere has roughly the same temperature as that of Earth, despite being fives times farther away from the sun.Scientists have dubbed this the planet’s energy crisis, and have long been puzzled by this detail, until now. New research published in Nature has found that the mystery of Jupiter’s super-heated atmosphere is related to one of its most iconic features  the infamous great red spot.The great red spot is a massive hurricane that has been raging for centuries. The diameter measures 10,000 miles, with winds of up to 400 miles per hour.The atmospheric temperature in Jupiter generally reaches 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit. But the area directly above great red spot is several hundred degrees hotter at 2,420 degrees.These findings, made using an infrared telescope, suggests a link between the planet’s upper and lower atmospheres, despite being separated by a vertical distance of 500 miles.The heat is likely caused by high-energy acoustic waves shooting up from the storm. The waves cause atoms in the air to move around, resulting in a raised temperature.Scientists are still unsure about why the great spot is red, but NASA expects to gather more information from the Juno spacecraft, which is now in orbit around Jupiter.]]></description>

      <title>Britain set to renew nuclear weapons system</title>
      <description><![CDATA[British politicians this week voted to continue with the country’s nuclear submarine fleet.British Parliament voted 427 to 117 on Monday to renew the UK’s fleet of Trident submarines, the country’s sole nuclear weapons system.One of Britain’s four Vanguard-class submarines constantly patrols the the world’s oceans. According to the Guardian, the vessels are virtually undetectable because they use a nuclear powered reactor.The submarines can be armed with up to 40 nuclear warheads, host 132 crew and numerous torpedoes. Each measures around 150 meters in length. Nuclear missiles in Trident submarines have a range of up to 7,500 miles, potentially allowing the UK to strike most of the world.The fleet operates out of the Faslane Naval Base in Scotland, with one submarine always on patrol around the world.The British government estimates the cost of Trident to be around $40 billion dollars, Reuters reported. However some say that could rise to more than $200 billion over the project’s lifetime.]]></description>

      <title>Australia develops cattle-herding robots</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Australian researchers have developed a special robot that can herd cattle in large, rugged terrain that may eventually replace farmers and herding dogs.The robot is known as the SwagBot. It is a battery-operated, omnidirectional ground vehicle developed by Australian Centre for Field Robotics.The SwagBot can move as fast as 20 kilometers per hour on smooth terrain. During its first field test, the robot demonstrated that it can also navigate through rugged terrain.“The trial has been very successful so far, so it’s given us the confidence to move to the next phase,” Salah Sukkarieh of the University of Sydney, the leader of the trial told New Scientist.The team is working on algorithms that will allow the SwagBot to detect changes in body temperature and postures of the cattle in order to monitor their health. It will also be equipped with colour and shape sensors to identify a good pasture land for the cattle.According to the New Scientist, the Swagbot will be the first robot in the world to be able to monitor the health of livestock if the algorithms are tested successfully.]]></description>

      <title>China completes the world&#x2019;s largest radio telescope</title>
      <description><![CDATA[China has officially completed its 1.2 billion yuan radio telescope, which could be the world’s largest for next one to two decades. The cost of its production is equal to roughly US$180 million.The 500-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope is located in a natural basin in Pingtang county of Guizhou province.The telescope’s reflector is made of 4,450 triangular aluminium panels and is the size of 30 football fields.It is the largest in the world, followed by Puerto Rico’s Arecibo Observatory and Germany’s Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope.The Chinese telescope is also capable of forming a parabolic mirror, which allows it to listen to anything within 40 degrees from its zenith, whereas the Arecibo can only listen to radio waves in one direction.With a working frequency range of 70 MHz to 3.0 GHz, Xinhua said the researchers aim to use the telescope to search for strange objects and listen for extraterrestrial life in the universe.More than 9,000 people were removed from their homes to create an isolated environment for the telescope. Each was paid roughly 10,000 yuan in compensation, or about US$1,500.]]></description>

      <title>Alaska&#x2019;s most active volcano will erupt soon, experts say</title>
      <description><![CDATA[One of Alaska’s most active volcanos will be erupting soon, according to experts.Warnings have been issued by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) of the imminent eruption of Pavlof Volcano, located on the Alaska Peninsula. The AVO is an organization formed to study and monitor volcanic activity in the state.The AVO increased an alert level for the volcano from “normal”  green, to “advisory”  yellow on July 1.The volcano erupted earlier this year in March triggering a red alert, the highest of four levels.That eruption sent an ash cloud as high as 37,000 feet into the atmosphere and covered villages to the northeast  including Nelson Lagoon  with a layer of ash that was as much as two-thirds of an inch thick.Reports from nearby scientific and coast guard observers suggest that the eruption produced volcanic mud flows and lava flows. The eruption was the first for Pavlof since November 2014 and noted by the AVO as the most energetic since 1996. Pavlof is one of the most consistently active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc. It has erupted six times since 1996 and 21 times in the past 50 years.]]></description>

      <title>NASA's Juno probe nears Jupiter</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, were listening for a series of tones on Monday night that will inform them whether the Juno spacecraft, has successfully performed a maneuver that will allow it to be pulled into orbit around Jupiter.The flyby for the Juno spacecraft, launched in August 2011, was designed to bump Juno's speed from 125,500 kph relative to the sun to 140,000 kph.Juno was launched via an Atlas V rocket, which also provided half of the boost it needs to reach Jupiter. By performing a so-called 'gravitational slingshot', Juno will gain the rest of the speed it needs for the long trip to Jupiter from Earth's gravitational field. A 'gravitational slingshot' involves the use of the relative movement and gravity of a planet to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft in order to save propellant and time. It can be used to accelerate and re-direct the path of a spacecraft.Juno is scheduled to arrive at Jupiter in this month after a journey 2.74 billion kilometers. The probe's major objectives are to understand the formation and evolution of Jupiter by determining the amount of water and ammonia present in the atmosphere, observing the dynamics and Jupiter's upper atmosphere and mapping the planet's magnetic and gravity fields to learn more about its deep interior.]]></description>

      <title>Your car&#x2019;s side window may be making one side of your body age faster</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A study has shown that while the windshields of cars may block a majority of harmful rays from vehicle drivers and passengers, side windows aren’t as effective. The study, published in JAMA Ophthalmology, found that car door windows offered varying levels of protection from the rays that are tied to cataracts and skin aging.Brian Boxer Wachler, of the Boxer Wachler Vision Institute in Beverly Hills, analyzed the ultraviolet protection provided by the glass in 29 cars from 15 different automobile manufacturers made from 1990 to 2014.Boxer Wachler’s research found that while front windshields blocked an average of 96 percent of UV-A rays, side windows only blocked 71 percent. Overall, only 14 percent of the cars offered a high level of side-window UV-A protection.UV rays account for a small portion of the sun’s rays but are the most damaging to human skin. UV-A rays are not filtered by the ozone layer and can penetrate through the second layer of skin.Because drivers in the U.S. have their left side exposed to sunlight, UV rays have been blamed for the increased number of cataracts and skin cancers that occur on the left side. Boxer Wachler believes the insufficient protection provided by car side windows could be a contributing factor.]]></description>

      <title>Giant helium reserve found in Tanzania</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Researchers have uncovered a helium gas field in the Tanzanian East African Rift Valley, which they say could address the increasingly critical shortage of the element.Widely known as the element that is lighter than air and commonly used to fill party balloons, helium has other important uses, including in welding, industrial leak detection, nuclear energy and, notably, MRI scanners. MRI scanners use powerful magnetic fields to map the human body. The superconducting magnets need to be kept at freezing temperatures, which are achieved with the use of liquid helium. The same concept is used in the Large Hadron Collider to accelerate particles to near the speed of light.The United States produces most of the world’s helium, as a byproduct of drilling for oil and gas. But U.S. government reserves of helium are running low, and little effort has been made in the country to develop new sources, resulting in a global shortage. That may be about to change. A research group from Oxford and Durham universities, working with Helium One, a helium exploration company headquartered in Norway, has found a massive source of helium underground in the Tanzanian East African Rift Valley, a highly volcanically active area in Africa.Volcanic activity in the rift valley provides an intense heat that has released helium from ancient deep rocks and trapped it in shallower gas fields.Independent experts have calculated a probable resource of 54 billion cubic feet in just one part of the rift valley. The amount is enough to fill over 1.2 million medical MRI scanners, and more than double the amount of helium held by the United States Federal Helium Reserve.But, if the helium reserves are too close in proximity to a volcano, they run the risk of being contaminated by carbon dioxide. Researchers are now looking into finding what they call a “goldilocks-zone,” somewhere between the ancient crust and the modern volcanoes, where the balance between helium release and volcanic dilution is “just right.”The study is a giant step towards creating a viable model for helium exploration.]]></description>

      <title>What you need to know about flesh-eating bacteria</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On June 28, 50-year-old Texas man Brian Parrott had to have his leg amputated after he contracted a flesh-eating bacterial infection from swimming in the Gulf of Mexico.The flesh-eating, hook-shaped bacteria is called vibrio, of which there are about a dozen species. The bacteria is known to survive in warm, coastal areas of brackish or salt water. Even the slightest of open wounds exposed to contaminated water allows the bacteria to enter the body. Species of vibrio are also known to invade the body through the consumption of bottom dwelling, bacteria-collecting seafood and shellfish, such as oysters.If the bacteria manages to enter the bloodstream, it can develop into vibriosis and lead to mild symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting, or severe symptoms such as skin lesions, septic shock, or even death. Those with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 80,000 cases of vibriosis develop each year, with roughly 65 percent of cases resulting from contaminated seafood. The bacteria most commonly spreads during the summer months from May to October. The Texas Department of State Health Services notes that most people who come into contact with the bacteria through open waters do not develop infection.]]></description>

Named the “blue whirl,” the tornado in controlled conditions could be the most efficient way to burn hydrocarbon fuel.Unlike yellow flames, a blue flame is a sign of a more complete, near-perfect burn with far fewer emissions.A fire tornado that burns in a blue-violet color has never been created before, but now researchers know how to start one. In a round glass tank with slits in its side, researchers placed a liquid fuel, n-heptane, onto a pool of water. When lit, the fire sucks out the oxygen in the air, as slits in the tank cause the fire to whirl; this creates a normal, yellow-burning fire tornado. To tame the yellow fire tornado, the engineers injected a slow, steady stream of fuel into it from below. And as the flame feeds off the fuel, it shrinks and burns blue. While there is still much to be learned about the flame, researchers did note they were able to maintain the flame for extended periods. The blue whirl offers an more efficient option for burning oil off water’s surface.]]></description>

      <title>MIT students designs &#x2018;smart&#x2019; tattoo that can control your phone</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A group of PhD students from MIT Media Lab, in collaboration with Microsoft Research, have developed a ‘smart’ tattoo that can remotely control your gadgets while looking pretty.The technology is called DuoSkin. According to the official website, there are three types of tattoos available. One version of the smart tattoo has an input function using capacitive touch sensing. The gold leaf functions as electrodes, and is attached to a touch controller that filters all raw data. Once the tattoo is applied onto the skin, the user can swipe or click on the tattoo as a trackpad.Another type of smart tattoo uses skin as a display. A layer of thermochromic ink is added into the tattoo, which changes colour when exposed to high temperatures. The third type of tattoo contains an NFC chip that connects to a coil made of gold leaf, which allows users to exchange data through near field communication.The technology will be presented at International Symposium on Wearable Computers 2016 in Heidelberg, Germany in September.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists discover Earth-like planet Proxima b</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Scientists have discovered a planet orbiting the star closest to our own sun. If that’s not remarkable enough, the planet lies in the star’s so-called Goldilocks zone, meaning it’s possible the planet’s surface supports liquid water, and perhaps even life.The exoplanet, named Proxima b, is believed to have a rocky surface and its minimum mass is 1.3 times that of the Earth. It is 4.2 light years, or 25 trillion miles away from our own planet, very close in cosmic terms.“We know there are terrestrial planets around many stars, and we kind of expected the nearby stars would contain terrestrial planets. This is not exciting because of this. The excitement is because it is the nearest one,” the New York Times quoted Guillem Anglada-Escudé, an astronomer at Queen Mary University of London and the leader of the team that made the discovery as saying.It orbits the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri within its habitable zone, at a distance less than 5 percent the distance between the sun and mercury. A full orbit --meaning a planetary year-- takes about 11 days.The planet is tidally locked, meaning one half of the planet is always bright and the other is always dark. The temperature of the planet’s surface could be around minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If it has an atmosphere, the temperature could reach as high as 86 degrees Fahrenheit on its light side, meaning it could be warm enough to hold liquid water, the Washington Post reported.]]></description>

      <title>President Obama sanctioned $400 million cash delivery to Iran</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe Wall Street Journal recently revealed that U.S. President Barack Obama sanctioned the $400 million delivery of cash to Iran in January of this year. The cash was delivered on the same day Tehran released four American prisoners, although U.S. officials maintain that was merely a coincidence and the money was not in exchange for the Americans’ release.The Obama administration says the money is the first part of a $1.7 billion Hague Tribunal settlement between the U.S. and Iran from an arms dispute dating back to 1979.The transfer consisted of Euros, Swiss Francs and other currencies, obtained from central banks in Switzerland and the Netherlands, CNN reported. It was placed on on wooden pallets before being delivered to Iran aboard an unmarked cargo plane.Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, President Obama said there was nothing “nefarious” about the payment. He explained it was delivered in cash because the U.S. has no banking relations with Iran.Some Republicans and other critics of the payment claim the exchange amounts to paying ransom for the Americans. They argue the money will be used by Tehran to sponsor terrorism.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s first human head transplant: Surgeon says possible scientific breakthrough is just two years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The world's first attempt to transplant a human head will be launched this year at a surgical conference in the United States. The procedure was first proposed  in 2013 by Sergio Canavero of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group in Italy to help extend the lives of people suffering from muscle and nerve degeneration or those who have advanced cancer. Canavero said the surgery could be ready as early as 2017.The procedure begins with doctors cooling the patient’s head and the donor’s body so their cells do not die during the operation. After the neck is cut through, major blood vessels are linked up using thin tubes, and the spinal cord cut cleanly with a sharp surgical knife to minimise nerve damage.The head is then moved on to the donor’s body, and the spinal cords can be fused together using polyethylene glycol to encourage the fat in cell membranes to mesh.Once the neck is sutured, the recipient will be kept in a coma for three or four weeks while implanted electrodes provide regular electrical stimulation to the spinal cord.Finally, when the patient wakes up from the coma, they will be able to feel their face and speak but will need a year of physiotherapy before they can walk.The first successful head transplant was carried out in 1970 by a team led by Robert White at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. The team transplanted the head of one monkey onto the body of another. They did not join the spinal cords, so the monkey was unable to move its body. But it was able to breathe with artificial assistance. The monkey died nine days later when its immune system rejected the head.Many neuroscientists are wary of the idea, calling it too outlandish to be a serious consideration and note there are many ethical implications related to the surgery.]]></description>

      <title>Pistorius murder trial: Prosecution's version of events</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This animation portrays the prosecution’s version of events on the night Reeva Steenkamp was shot to death by Oscar Pistorius. The prosecution rested its case against Oscar Pistorius on March 25th, the 15th day of his trial for the shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.  Through the testimony of numerous police and civilian witnesses, the prosecution has tried to paint Pistorius as violent, impulsive, and infatuated with guns. In prosecutor Gerrie Nel’s version of events, Pistorius and Steenkamp had an argument between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Valentine’s Day, 2013.  The argument was sufficiently intense to wake neighbors. Around 3 a.m., Steenkamp locked herself in the separate toilet room inside their bathroom. Pistorius, walking on his stumps rather than on his prosthetics as the defense claims he did, took his 9mm handgun into the bathroom. Neighbors heard a female scream, which the prosecution says came from Steenkamp inside the toilet room. Pistorius then fired the first shot, which traveled through the toilet room door, and broke Steenkamp’s hip. Police ballistics expert Captain Chris Mangema testified that Steenkamp would have still had sufficient time to scream after the bullet struck her hip. Neighbors heard that second scream followed by three more gunshots in quick succession, the last of which was fatal.Pistorius said he fired in self-defence after he mistook her for a home intruder who had entered through the bathroom window.If convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists discover 1000-year-old monk inside Buddha statue</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A CT-scan of an ancient Buddha statue has led to the unique discovery of a mummified Chinese monk, dating back to the 11th century and preserved in the same position as its exterior statue. The Buddha statue, which was on display at the Drents Museum in the Dutch city of Assen, was analyzed at the Meander Medical Center in Amersfoort.A team of scientists and doctors tested the statue using CT-scan imaging and an endoscope. Amsterdam resident Erik Bruijn headed the project, according to the NL Times online.  The mummified body has been identified as Master Liuquan, a Buddhist monk who likely practiced Sokushinbutsu, or self-mummification. Radiologist Ben Heggelman took bone samples to confirm the mummy’s identification with DNA testing. The statue, which is currently visiting Hungary, will be on display in Budapest until May 2015.]]></description>

      <title>Oscar Pistorius trial: pathologist gives different sequence of bullets</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Pathologist Jan Botha, the first defence witness, presented a different sequence of bullets to the court from the prosecution’s on day 17 of Oscar Pistorius’s murder trial. Botha told the court that Reeva Steenkamp would not have screamed, as Oscar Pistorius could have fired four shots within four seconds. She would have been in a state of pain, shock and fear. Botha believed that Steenkamp had been standing close to the toilet door. The first bullet hit her right hip, making her lose her balance.The second shot hit her in the right arm.The third shot injured Steenkamp’s left hand and then ricocheted off the wall.The prosecution established that Steenkamp had eaten at 1:00 a.m., two hours before her death. But Botha argued that ‘gastric emptying’ was not a scientific way to determine time of death.Botha said the bladder fills at a rate of 60ml an hour. If Steenkamp's bladder was empty, it meant that she had urinated before the shooting.Pistorius began vomiting as Botha was describing grisly details on Steenkamp’s wounds.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[German authorities said the man who stabbed four people at a train station near Munich early Tuesday did not appear to be part of an Islamic network.According to local media, the suspect is from the western city of Hessen. He took a train to Munich on Monday morning. He then stayed there until he boarded a train to Grafing that evening and spent the night at the station.The suspect confessed that he had taken drugs at the time of the attack. His first victim was a 56-year-old man on the train that leaves for Munich from Grafing. He allegedly shouted ‘God is the Greatest’ in Arabic before stabbing the man, who later died at the hospital.He then stabbed another man on the platform and two cyclists, who were rushing to help the victims in the front yard of the station.Police arrested the suspect outside the station shortly after the attacks. He was barefoot and had a knife in his belt.Authorities said the suspect had given very confusing statements and he might be referred to a psychiatric institution.]]></description>

      <title>Police accidents: Florida cop dies protecting woman from collision with wrong-way driver</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A Hillsborough County, Florida police officer has been hailed a hero after sacrificing his life to save a woman from a speeding SUV.The Tampa Tribune reports that Sarah Geren was on her way home with her boyfriend around 2:45 a.m. on Saturday, driving from Ybor City to Valrico on the Selmon Expressway in Tampa.An SUV driven by Erik McBeth, 31, had entered the same highway through an exit ramp and was heading west on an eastbound lane. Geren spotted the car’s headlights coming toward her and panicked. She flashed her lights repeatedly in an attempt to warn the other driver.As the SUV continued to barrel forward, Geren decided to pull her car as far right as she could. But Deputy John Kotfila, 30, who was driving behind Geren, sped past her then and was hit by the speeding vehicle. Geren witnessed the crash, the impact from the collision sending debris from both cars flying. She called 911 to report the wreck.Kotfila, a six-year veteran with the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Department department, was taken to the hospital where he died from his injuries. McBeth died on the spot. Authorities are investigating whether he was driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident, according to WFLA.]]></description>

      <title>Plane catches fire during takeoff at Florida airport</title>
      <description><![CDATA[More than a dozen people were injured after a plane suddenly caught fire while it taxied for departure on Thursday afternoon at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida.The fire occurred on a Venezuela-bound Dynamic International Airways flight carrying 101 people. While the Boeing 767 was taxiing for departure, its left engine began to leak fuel and the engine burst into flames at around 12:30 p.m. Before the fire occurred, the pilot of an aircraft traveling behind the Dynamic flight reported the incident to the pilot of the leaking plane, who then tried to turn back to the airport. Seconds later the air traffic control tower caught one of the pilots on the Dynamic flight saying, “Engine’s on fire. Engine’s on fire.” Three of the four emergency chutes were immediately deployed after the engine caught fire. All of the passengers on the aircraft were safely evacuated within six minutes. Fifteen people sustained minor injuries during the fire although one person did have serious burns, according to CNN. Dynamic International Airways says it is investigating the matter and plans to operate a normal schedule beginning on Friday.]]></description>

      <title>Airbus to equip jets with ejectable black boxes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Airbus is looking to install ejectable flight recorders on its long-haul A380 and A350 passenger jets, which would make it easier to locate them in the event of a crash over the ocean.“Airbus is working with EASA ... and other stakeholders to advance the approval of such a solution industry-wide,” said a spokesman for the European planemaker told Reuters.An ejectable flight recorder combines both cockpit voice and flight data recorders. Located at the rear end of the plane, it would automatically eject in the event of a crash. It is equipped with an airbag system that allows it to stay afloat, and can emit satellite distress signals, with details of the location of the crash.Divers retrieved the cockpit voice recorder from AirAsia Flight QZ8501 on Tuesday, a day after recovering the flight data recorder. The Airbus A320 lost contact on December 28 while flying to Singapore from Surabaya.]]></description>

      <title>Voyager 1 hangs on the solar system's "heliocliff"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Voyager 1, the U.S. spacecraft launched into space 35 years ago, is on the verge of breaking out of our solar system and into interstellar space, according to scientists. Members of the Voyager 1 project team describe the probe as being on the edge of a "heliocliff". This region of the heliosphere, the magnetic "bubble" that encapsulates the solar system, exhibits very weak influence from the sun and very high levels of cosmic rays, NASA says. These rays, which are high-energy particles such a protons and Helium nuclei, come from interstellar space beyond the heliosphere.Voyager 1 has registered higher and higher levels of cosmic rays, with a marked increase in the last few months. Scientists believe the probe will have made it through into interstellar space when it starts to detect a change in the direction of magnetic field lines. The project team is not certain when this will happen, nor do they know what to expect when Voyager 1 finally does leave the solar system.]]></description>

      <title>US launches first drone from aircraft carrier</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The U.S. Navy successfully launched an unmanned jet from the deck of an aircraft carrier on Tuesday, making aviation history, according to a Reuters report.The X-47B, a bat-winged experimental drone the size of a fighter jet, was launched from an aircraft carrier off the coast of Virginia.The radar-evading drone has a 62 foot wingspan and a length of 38 feet. The wings can be folded for easier storage on aircraft carriers.The jet is fully autonomous, but human operators on board the aircraft carrier standby in the event of a malfunction.Designed to fly farther and stay in the air longer than existing aircrafts, it has a range of more than 3,400 km and can reach an altitude of over 40,000 feet.The drone has yet to land on the deck of an aircraft carrier, but the navy expects it to complete this more complex task later this year.The test flight, which had been years in the making, is being seen as a milestone in drone technology.]]></description>

      <title>Mars mission would expose astronauts to dangerous levels of radiation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[U.S. space agency NASA will have to find creative solutions to overcoming the hazards of space radiation for future manned missions to Mars.Radiation readings from the Curiosity rover en route to and while on Mars have revealed levels dangerous to humans. Exposure to solar radiation would be highest during the 180 to 253 day journey to the red planet. Current spacecraft radiation shielding is insufficient for such long journeys. Walls filled with hydrogen-rich water offer one solution. Electromagnetic shields could provide even more protection. Astronauts would need this protection to survive the mission. An average CT scan gives a dose of around 10 millisieverts, whereas a round-trip to Mars would expose a human to 554-770 of radiation.Excessive exposure to radiation can cause cataracts, cancer of the thyroid glands, lungs and stomach, and sterility.NASA aims to send humans to Mars sometime in the 2030s.This animation depicts some technical solutions to the hazard of radiation and its effects on astronauts.]]></description>

      <title>Japan successfully extracts gas from offshore methane hydrate</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Japan's state-run energy company Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp (JOGMEC) says it has successfully extracted gas from offshore methane hydrate deposits.Methane hydrate consists of methane trapped in crystalline structure of frozen water, and it is being explored as a future source of natural gas, due to the large deposits trapped under oceans and permafrost around the globe. It is viewed as a clean energy source, as carbon dioxide can be injected into wells during the extraction process. According to Reuters, "A Japanese study has estimated the existence of at least 40 trillion cubic feet (1.1 trillion cubic meters) of methane hydrates in the eastern Nankai Trough off the country's Pacific coast, about 11 years of Japanese gas consumption.Japan used depressurization to turn methane hydrate to methane gas, a process thought by the government to be more effective than using the hot water circulation method the country had tested successfully in 2002."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Billionaire philanthropist Elon Musk, often likened to Iron Man's Tony Stark, has hinted at a new high-speed transport he is working on that could put planes and trains out of business. The new technology would be a travel tube with Concorde-like seating inside. The travel tubes would be launched by a rail gun type launch power. The tube would shoot through an underground tunnel, using a maglev like system, like the "floating force" of an air hockey table.The tubes would be at least three times faster than a bullet train and twice as fast as an airplane. Powered by solar technology, the transport would also be cheaper than conventional methods. The "Hyperloop" could undertake a journey from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 30 minutes.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A student from MIT has invented alcohol-aware ice cubes, which flash in sync with ambient music and sounds, and are able to detect how much alcohol someone has consumed. Each cube comprises an LED, accelerometer, IR transceiver and a battery that has the capability to track how often the glass is raised to someone's lips. A timer monitors the sips and helps to estimate how drunk the person is. The LED inside each cube will change color from green, to orange and finally red to indicate how much alcohol a person has consumed. It can also send a text message to friends telling them when someone is intoxicated.]]></description>

      <title>ESA's Proba-V satellite becomes first to pickup aircraft tracking signals</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The European Space Agency's Proba-V satellite, launched to map global vegetation in May is being put to some interesting uses.Commercial aircraft have traditionally relied on radar for positioning and air traffic control data. But over vast oceans it is of limited use. Newer aircraft use ADS-B  signals to transmit speed, position and altitude data, but the signal is weak. The Proba-V is the first satellite to use these signals to track aircraft over remote expanses like oceans and deserts where receivers are scarce. Continuous tracking by satellite means more efficient routes, better safety and better fuel economy for aircraft.The satellite, which is smaller than one cubic meter, will still be used mainly for it's primary mission - mapping vegetation around the planet every two days.This animation explains the benefits of continuous satellite-based aircraft tracking and depicts the satellite tracking aircraft.]]></description>

      <title>Orionid meteor shower to peak Sunday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Orionid Meteor Shower will light up the early morning sky on October 21. The Orionid Meteor shower gets its name because of its close proximity to Betelgeuse, the second-brightest star in the Orion constellation. During the shower, meteors created by tiny bits of rock and metal can be seen streaking across the sky as the earth passes through the debris left behind by Halley's Comet. According to experts the peak of the meteor shower will bring 20 to 30 meteors an hour.]]></description>

      <title>34th America's Cup: A guide to the AC72 boat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The 34th America's Cup gets underway in San Francisco on Sunday when Team New Zealand, Luna Rossa and Artemis will battle for the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series, with the winner going on to contest the America's Cup with reigning champion Oracle.This year's event will use the revolutionary AC72-class catarmarans, which have a crew of 11 and stand 40 meters tall.These 22m long, high tech twin-hulled boats are constructed of composite materials and feature rigid sails and foils to maximise speeds.The rigids sails work like aircraft wings, creating unequal pressure zones that can see the vessels achieve speeds more than twice the windspeed.While the foils enable the boat to lift out of the water at high speed, eliminating drag and pushing the top speeds up to  around 40 knots, or 74 kilometers per hour.But with added speed comes risk. The boats have been known to pitchpole, when the stern pitches forward over the bow.An incident in May when the Artemis boat pitchpoled resulted in the death of British Olympic gold medallist Andrew Simpson.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Nissan Motor Co plans to equip some of its models with "steer-by-wire", a computerized engine technology, to control steering electronically. The system works by sending signals generated by the driver's inputs to a computerised control unit that then instructs an actuator controlling tire movements. Using the electronic signal, the tires can quickly move in accordance with the steering wheel. The technology can also adjust the steering to control wandering caused by rough roads and crosswinds and a front camera recognizes road markings.]]></description>

      <title>Russia superhighway: NYC to London by car a reality or pipedream?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Driving from London to New York City would be possible if Russia succeeds in building a superhighway spanning across the country with links to western Europe and Asia. Russian Railways head Vladimir Yakunin unveiled an ambitious plan for a super highway and railway link from the United Kingdom to the United States during a March meeting with the Russian Academy of Science.If the plan, dubbed the Trans-Eurasian Belt Development, is realised, motorists will be able to drive from London to New York. Russia hopes the development will spur the economies of remote cities and towns. The Trans-Siberian Railway is about 9,000 kilometres long. According to CNN, a road trip from London to New York would cover about 20,777 kilometers. Yakunin said other infrastructure such as oil pipelines, power plants and water supply facilities will be built alongside the highway and high-speed railway. The mega highway system will face a multitude of difficulties, one of them being the connection to Alaska across the Bering Strait. Either a long bridge or a undersea tunnel would be needed. Money is likely to be another challenge. Russian Railways said the construction cost would amount to trillions of dollars.]]></description>

      <title>First round-the-world solar flight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Swiss pilots Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg will attempt to fly around the world in a solar-powered plane, in a bid to prove that such a flight is possible without the use of fossil fuels.The Solar Impulse 2 will take off from Abu Dhabi in late February or early March. The solar-powered plane has a wingspan of 72 metres, larger than that of a Boeing 747, but weighs only 2.3 tons, about as much as a family car.More than 17,000 solar cells on the wing power lithium-ion batteries in four electric motors. The airframe makes use of carbon fiber, which is three times lighter than paper, to keep the plane as light as possible.The two pilots will take turns in an unheated, unpressurized one-man cabin that contains six oxygen bottles for high-altitude flight. An ergonomic seat in the cabin allows the pilot to take naps, with a wrist-mounted buzzer to alert him in the event of an emergency. There is a toilet in the seat and a liferaft and parachute in the seat back.The plane will take off at night at 35 kmph and ascend to 8,500 metres during the day at a top speed of 140 kmph as it stores solar energy. At night the plane will descend to 1,500 metres and slow down to conserve power.The 35,000 km flight is expected to take about five months, with stops in Oman, India, Myanmar, China, the United States, and in Southern Europe or North Africa depending on the weather. The Solar Impulse 2 is expected to land back in Abu Dhabi in late July or early August.Piccard, an airplane and glider pilot, flew around the world in a balloon in 1999 and pioneered ultralight aircraft in the 1970s. Borschberg, an engineer and graduate of MIT’s Sloan School of Business, joined the Solar Impulse project after two years in the Swiss air force.]]></description>

      <title>Cluster bombs: an explainer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Human Rights Watch has accused the Syrian government of using cluster bombs on civilian areas in its fight against rebels. The use of cluster munitions is banned in 77 countries under an international convention which Syria has not signed. Online video footage has shown cluster bomb dispensers and unexploded submunitions. The weapons have been identified as Russian-made RBK-250 cluster bomb dispensers and AO-1SCh fragmentation bomblets. Cluster bombs can be dropped by planes. They explode in the air delivering hundreds of submunitions over an area roughly the size of a football field. Some fail to detonate on initial impact thus becoming landmines that can threaten civilian populations. This animation demonstrates how cluster bombs work.]]></description>

      <title>New wind generation technology produces 6 times more energy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A wind power company, SheerWind, from Minnesota USA has announced its new Invelox wind power generation technology. The company says its turbine could generate six times more energy than the amount produced by traditional turbines mounted on towers. Invelox does not rely on high wind speeds. It captures wind at any speed, even as low as 2 miles per hour. The wind captured is then funneled through a duct where it picks up speed. The resulting kinetic energy will drive the generator on the ground level and produces electricity.Invelox is said to be able to generate higher power with reduced generation costs.

      <title>Curiosity Mars rover to look for signs of life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Mars Science Laboratory was launched from Cape Canaveral on Nov. 26, 2011 and is scheduled to land the Mars Curiosity rover on August 5. The chief goal of the $2.5 billion mission is to look for signs of life.The Curiosity Mars rover can drill to a depth of two inches. At two inches, complex organic molecules, better signs of past life than simple organic molecules, are destroyed by cosmic rays after a few hundred million years.If the rover finds complex organic molecules, it will likely do so in a crater that's less than 10 million years old.]]></description>

The device acted as a high-tech dead letter drop. An asset would upload information to the rock and an agent would then later download the information. Russian security found and monitored the device's activity before seizing it. In 2006, Moscow revealed it had captured the device, but the UK didn't claim responsibility until now.]]></description>

      <title>Mars manned mission: Mars Direct plan for Mars colonization</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A manned mission to Mars could be launched using technology that is currently available. This animation describes the Mars Direct plan for sending a manned mission to Mars, which was envisioned by engineer Robert Zubrin and the Mars Society and subsequently used by NASA as a "design reference mission."According to the Mars Direct plan, an Unmanned Earth Return Vehicle, or ERV, would be launched to Mars to prepare a base for astronauts. The ERV would land on Mars eight months later and deploy scientific rovers to explore the area around the landing site and a telerobotically driven truck with a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor. The truck would deploy the nuclear reactor, which use 6 metric tons of liquid hydrogen brought from Earth to produce 108 metric tons of methane-oxygen fuel.Roughly two years later, a second ERV as well as a manned spaceship would be launched to Mars. The manned space ship would carry four astronauts, habitation modules, a pressurized rover and provisions for the manned mission.Six months later, the manned mission would land on Mars near the first ERV and use 12 metric tons of the methane-oxygen fuel produced by the first ERV to power their exploration mission. The second ERV would land several hundred kilometers away from the first ERV and begin to prepare a site for a second manned mission.Eighteen months later, the first four astronauts would return to Earth in the first ERV. The return trip would be powered by 96 metric tons of the methane-oxygen fuel generated on Mars.The process would repeat itself as subsequent ERVs and manned spaceships land on Mars, resulting in a string of bases on the planet.]]></description>

      <title>Mars manned mission: MIT professor developing cheaper, more practical space suit</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A skin-tight suit designed being developed by a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an Italian motorcyclist gear company could be a cheaper, more utilitarian alternative to today's bulky gas-filled space suits.The BioSuit applies pressure to the body mechanically with form-fitting fabric made from elastic polymers and a "skeleton" of filaments that maintain the structure of the suit while allowing for natural movement. Current space suits use gas to maintain a pressurized environment, which makes them bulky and hard to move around in. An astronaut on the surface of Mars would need to wear a pressurized suit to survive, because Mars' atmospheric pressure is less than 1 percent of Earth's. Without a pressurized suit, blood in the astronaut's body would congeal and tissue would expand.Current space suits cost as much as $20 million. The BioSuit could cost one-tenth that amount. The BioSuit is being developed by Dava Newman, a professor of aeronautics, astronautics and engineering systems at MIT, with a grant from NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts. Newman is working with industrial designers Trotti & Associates, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and motorcyclist gear company Dainese, of Molvena, Italy.]]></description>

      <title>UK to build commercial spaceport by 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The UK government has said it plans to build a spaceport in the country by 2018. It will be the first of its kind outside the US.According to the BBC, eight aerodromes have been shortlisted and Scotland is home to six of the potential locations. The spaceport will be built at a remote site where regular air traffic is low. It will require a longer-than usual runway of up to 3,000 metres or more because spaceplanes travel at far greater speeds than standard planes and need more room to land, New Scientist reported.The spaceport could be used to launch satellites as well as for commercial spaceflights. The government hopes that the port will be a part of Virgin Galactic’s space tourism business, according to the Independent. Virgin Galactic’s first flights are scheduled to take off from a spaceport in New Mexico at the end of the year. The £120,000 trip will allow passengers to travel to a height of around 100 km and allow them to experience about six minutes of zero-gravity in a tiny spacecraft.Virgin says it wants to open spaceports in other countries and has already had talks with Scottish ministers about developing a site at Lossiemouth, the Guardian reported.]]></description>

      <title>NASA using converted spy planes to collect polar data</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NASA is using a converted Cold War era U2 spy plane to study Alaskan and Arctic Ocean ice pack conditions and diminishing summer sea ice.The ER-2 aircraft, a high-altitude research jet, is a refashioned spy plane received from the Air Force in 1971, Tech Times reported. Its light frame allows it to climb to a very high altitude; maximum of 12.5 miles.Between July 12 and August 1, two pilots, Denis Steele and Tim Williams, will take turns in piloting the ER-2. According to News Miner, one of the two pilots will pilot the aircraft and collect data, the other will stay on the ground to assist during landing and takeoff, and to facilitate communication between the aircraft and the ground crew.Sea ice data is collected by a laser altimeter which measures ice depth. The device, the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), is housed in the aircraft’s nose.Data collected will allow researchers to develop computer algorithms to analyze the information and ice depth readings collected in the future by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 or ICESat-2, due to launch in 2017. According to NASA, the ER-2 is one of the few powered vehicles in the world capable of gathering data similar to that collected by satellites. Each of the ER-2 six missions will last eight hours, for a total of 48 hours of flight time, NASA said.]]></description>

      <title>Airbus unveils new A350 XWB family to compete with Boeing 777 and 787</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Airbus recently launched a world tour for its newest aircraft, the A350 XWB. The planes are designed to replace the company’s 330 and 340 models and directly compete with Boeing’s 777 and 787 models. A350 XWB (extra-wide-bodied) are twin engine long-range planes that fly long-haul routes with a range of up to 15,300 kilometers. There are three variants: the A350-800, the shortest model; the A350-900, the standard model; and the A350-1000, the extra-long model. According to reports, Airbus may offer an even larger A350-1100 model in the future. The aircrafts feature 5.61 meter-wide cabins, which positions them between Boeing’s 787 and 777 cabins. Airbus claims wider cabin width allows for wider seats and more headroom for passengers, as well as more panoramic windows. The A350 family is also the first Airbus design to have carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) fuselage and wings. Airbus says greater fuel efficiency and larger passenger capacity  between 276 to 369 passengers  makes the planes 25 percent more cost effective than their competitors.]]></description>

      <title>Seismic activity near Icelandic volcano: authorities raise code orange flight alert</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A cluster of earthquakes at and around the Bardarbunga volcano have been recorded from August 16, prompting Iceland to raise its volcano alert to code orange. Code orange is the second-highest level of risk, indicating that the “volcano is exhibiting signs of elevated unrest above known background level,” according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.Seismic activity may cause the volcano to erupt, although so far there are no indications that magma has reached the surface.The eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano in 2010 shut down much of Europe’s airspace for six days, affecting the flights of 10 million people.Volcanic ash consists of rocks, ash, sand and other particulates that are harmful to the plane engine. Glass melts when passing the combustion chamber, which has a temperature as high as 1,500 degrees Celsius.The molten glass particles then stick to the turbine blades and bring them to a standstill. This can cause the engines to stall.The particles in the ash can also block the pitot tubes, which act as airspeed sensors. The blockage will give the aircraft false airspeed readings, which could be unnoticeable by the pilots.]]></description>

Bush took the Ice Bucket Challenge, and challenged former President Bill Clinton to do it next.The viral Ice Bucket Challenge campaign has raised more than $40 million for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig’s disease, to the ALS Association, which will go toward finding treatments and a cure for ALS as well as for providing support to people with the disease.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. ALS attacks the motor neurons that provide voluntary movements and muscle power, according to the ALS Association.The exact cause of ALS has not yet been determined but glutamate poisoning is a popular theory suggested by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Glutamate is an amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter, allowing motor neurons to communicate with one another. Glutamate is supposed to be cleaned by a cell membrane protein after transmitting a message. Researchers suggest ALS patients don’t have enough of that protein. Glutamate clogs the space between the nerve endings, causing motor neurons to degenerate over time. As motor neurons degenerate, they can no longer send impulses to the muscle fibers, causing muscles to atrophy.Initial symptoms of ALS often include increasing muscle weakness, especially the arms and legs. Patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.This animation explains how ALS affects the human body.]]></description>

      <title>Costa Concordia salvage: worst-case scenario</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Salvage work is expected to begin soon on the Costa Concordia, currently resting in shallow waters off the island of Giglio but precariously close to a 70-meter drop. The stricken Italian cruise ship weighs 114,500 tons and is holding 2,400 tons of fuel oil. In a worst-case scenario, tides or a storm surge could cause it to slide and sink to the depths below. If the oil spilled, it would hamper salvage work and devastate Europe's largest cetacean sanctuary.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[At least six people are dead after the Costa Concordia hit rock off the Tuscan coast around 9:30pm on Saturday. The Concordia quickly started to take on water and began to list badly. It is believed the captain decided to head for the harbor of Giglio. Once near the shore and in shallow water, the wash from the Concordia may have been deflected back toward the hull, causing it to roll. It has settled at a 90° angle on its starboard side.]]></description>

      <title>Navy tugboat USS Conestoga discovered after 95 years lost at sea</title>
      <description><![CDATA[After nearly a century of trying to uncover the mysterious fate of the U.S.S. Conestoga and its crew, scientists can finally offer an explanation as to what happened.On March 25, 1921, the USS Conestoga set sail from Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, carrying 56 officers and crew members on board. Bound for Pearl Harbor, then Tutuila, American Samoa, it was intended to operate as a station ship. Unfortunately, it never made it to its destination.Weather logs indicate that at some point along its ill-fated journey, it met with a vicious storm, rough seas and dastardly winds likely damning the Navy tugboat and the men on board.In 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was conducting a hydrographic survey to measure the depths of the seafloor using multibeam sonar technology, when it discovered what appeared to be a shipwreck.An investigation followed in 2014 using remotely operated vehicles and robots. Roughly 185 feet below the water’s surface, scientists found a ship 170 feet long and 26 feet wide, complete with a steam engine, steering gear, and a naval gun to match those of the once-vanished Conestoga. Based on the location of the wreck, the Conestoga barely managed to travel just 24 miles after departing from California’s Golden Gate Strait, sinking within the first 24 hours of the expedition, roughly three miles from Southeast Farallon Island. While many questions have been answered, what became of the crew is still anyone’s guess. No traces of the sailors’ bodies were ever recovered.]]></description>

      <title>Train derailment in Canada: conductor missing, oil spilled into river</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A train engineer is missing after his train derailed on Thursday morning into the Moisie River in Quebec. The train was towing three locomotives and 240 railcars, many of them empty, CBC News reported, when a landslide is believed to have pushed it off the tracks and caused it to plunge into the river.According to the Quebec Environment Ministry’s emergency team, the accident also caused the locomotive to spill diesel into the Moisie River for hours after it ran off the tracks. The locomotive’s reservoir could carry up to 18,000 litres of fuel, but it is not clear how much fuel was in the tank at the time of the accident. CTV News Canada said an oil spill extended for about 20 kilometres out from the shore.Divers were sent to the scene to search for the missing operator, the Ottawa Sun reported. The name of the man has not been released.Rio Tinto said all railway traffic has been suspended until further notice.]]></description>

      <title>How Hong Kong police may clear pro-democracy protest site</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A former high-ranking Hong Kong police officer briefed Next Media on possible tactics police in the city may use to clear pro-democracy protest sites in Admiralty, where protesters have blocked the major roads near the government headquarters for more than a month.According to the former police officer, the first step would be cordoning off the protest area in Admiralty with 1,000 police officers.Separately, groups of police officers would board MTR trains from different stations after the system has closed for the night to avoid attracting attention.About 3,000 police officers would then exit at the Admiralty MTR station through different exits and swiftly converge on the protesters sometime between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.Police would press the protesters on the ground, tie their hands and feet, and arrest them.It has been rumoured that the Hong Kong Police Force will clear pro-democracy protest sites with more force, possibly as early as Wednesday, after the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit ends in Beijing on Tuesday.Hong Kong’s acting chief executive on Tuesday warned students to clear protest areas or face arrest.“To those who are unlawfully occupying the roads, we call for you to leave the areas quickly and peacefully,” said Carrie Lam, who is acting chief executive while Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying attends the APEC summit.]]></description>

      <title>Rosetta mission: lacking sunlight, Philae lander enters deep sleep</title>
      <description><![CDATA[After landing in a bad spot atop the surface of Comet 67P, the Rosetta mission’s Philae probe has now entered deep sleep as sunlight is unable to reach its solar panels.The landing took an unexpected turn when the probe bounced twice after its first touchdown on Comet 67P on Wednesday. The probe rested on its side against a cliff. Despite not having much energy, Philae managed to transmit important data about Comet 67P back to Earth before its batteries died on Saturday.ESA mission controllers sent commands to the probe to rotate its body in an attempt to expose a larger portion of it to sunlight, but the rotation happened too late to charge the batteries and the lander has since fallen silent, the Guardian reported. Conditions may change as comet 67P moves closer to the sun, which could make it possible for the lander to charge its secondary battery, according to CNN. When it awakes, the Philae may be able to send more data and photos back to Earth.Comet 67P is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on August 13 2015, a distance of about 185 million kilometers, roughly between the orbits of Earth and Mars.]]></description>

      <title>NASA&#x2019;s inflatable heat shield may could one day be used to land astronauts on Mars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NASA is developing an inflatable heat shield it plans to test in 2016 that could one day be used to send astronauts to Mars.Designed by NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, the IRVE 3, or Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment, could help overcome the difficulties of landing on the Red Planet, where the atmosphere is too thin for modern rockets or parachutes to safely land large spacecraft.The heat shield was inspired by a children’s toy, the stacking ring of donuts. Inside the heat shield are inflatable segments covered in thermal blankets.Upon entering the Martian atmosphere, the rings would be inflated with nitrogen into the shape of a mushroom, and the heat shield would slow the descent of the spacecraft in an atmosphere that is 100 times thinner than that of the Earth’s.The technology will be tested on the next flight of the Antares rocket in 2016.Because the heat shield is inflatable and lightweight, it would free up more room inside a spacecraft. It would also allow for spacecraft large enough to carry humans to land on Mars, unlike current heat shields which can only land rovers.]]></description>

      <title>Ice jams prompt flood warnings in Pennsylvania</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A flood warning remains in effect across parts of North America including Armstrong and Clarion counties in Pennsylvania through Monday as the Allegheny River may give way to ice jams, causing an overflow of water in the surrounding area.Ice jams usually occur in spring when river ice starts to thaw. An ice jam, alternatively called an ice dam, is formed when a river’s flow is blocked by downstream ice floe.This leads to an increase in water level, which causes flooding when the flowing water overcomes the dam of river ice or the river banks. River ice jams pose a great danger as they are unpredictable and can lead to more rapid and deeper flooding.A resident of Clarion County said that ice jams occurred along the Allegheny River around the same time in 1959.]]></description>

      <title>Self-driving car to begin coast-to-coast road trip</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Delphi Automotive hopes their self-driving car will travel across the country on Sunday. The Audi SQ5 will travel 3,500 miles from San Francisco, California to New York City, New York. It is the first coast-to-coast trip by an autonomous vehicle, and arguably the longest automated drive ever attempted.The luxury SUV is making the journey in order to test Delphi's advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), vehicle-to-infrastructure wireless communications, as well as automated driving software. The Audi SQ5 will be subject to a variety of driving conditions, from changing weather and terrain, to potential road hazards. Delphi will test its advanced driving assistance systems while the vehicle makes its way through busy intersections, highways and maneuver past cyclists.The navigation system, cameras and sensors are all controlled by intelligent software that enables the vehicle to make complex, human-like decisions. The vehicle features functions like Delphi's Traffic Jam Assist, Automated Highway Pilot with Lane Change (on-ramp to off-ramp highway pilot), Automated Urban Pilot, and Automated Parking and Valet features will all be put through tests during its 10-day journey.]]></description>

      <title>Germanwings crash: what happened in the cockpit</title>
      <description><![CDATA[French investigators have said that the co-pilot of the Germanwings jet intentionally plowed the plane into the French alps after examining data retrieved from the plane’s cockpit voice recorder.German police searched co-pilot Andreas Lubitz’s flat in Dusseldorf and his parents’ residence in Montabaur and were seen taking bags of evidence and a computer. Authorities said they made a “significant discovery” but said there was no evidence to suggesting the 28-year-old co-pilot was a terrorist. Germanwings Flight U49525 was at a cruising height of 38,000 feet around half an hour into its flight at 10:27 a.m. on Tuesday,The cockpit voice recording shows that pilot Patrick Sonderheimer and co-pilot Andreas Lubitz were chatting without incident before the pilot left the cockpit.After a short while, the pilot tried to re-enter the cockpit. He used the intercom system to ask Lubitz to open the cockpit door, but received no answer. The pilot the started knocking on the door but Lubitz did not respond. Sonderheimer then attempted to use an emergency code to regain entry to the cockpit, but Lubitz overrode the codes, locking the cockpit door from the inside. Lubitz then put the plane into a controlled descent at approximately 10.29am, the pilot can later be heard trying to break the door down.Recordings show despite audible alarms sounding inside the cockpit, the co-pilot was breathing calmly before the jet crashed.Currently, European airlines allow one pilot to remain in the cockpit alone. The crash will likely prompt a change in cockpit rules for international airlines.]]></description>

      <title>Germanwings crash: French authorities release preliminary timeline</title>
      <description><![CDATA[French authorities on Wednesday released a preliminary report on the March 24 Germanwings crash, using the flight recorders and recordings of radio communications to provide the most detailed picture to date of what happened inside the plane in the moments before its copilot is suspected of crashing it into the Alps.According to the French Bureau d’Enquetes et d’Analyses accident investigation agency’s preliminary report, shortly after Germanwings flight 9525 reached a cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, the captain left the cockpit. About half a minute later, copilot Andreas Lubitz set the plane’s autopilot to fly the plane to the lowest possible altitude, 100 feet, and increased the rpm in both of the plane’s engines. After a short while, the pilot tried to re-enter the cockpit. He used the intercom system to ask Lubitz to open the cockpit door, but received no answer. The pilot started knocking and can then be heard trying to break the door down. The plane crashed less than a minute later, killing all 150 people on board.]]></description>

      <title>El Chapo prison escape: Overview of the drug lord&#x2019;s escape from Altiplano prison</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman escaped from a prison in central Mexico on Saturday night, embarrassing Mexican officials who had promised that El Chapo’s 2001 escape, achieved with the help of prison guards, would not be repeated.Guzman escaped from Altiplano Federal Penitentiary at around 8:52 p.m. local time on Saturday by crawling through a series of tunnels located right underneath the shower of his prison cell. The longest tunnel, a 1,500-metre-long horizontal tunnel included lighting and ventilation, and ended at an isolated house in the nearby neighborhood of Santa Juanita.Mexican authorities have begun a manhunt in the area and are holding at least 30 employees for questioning, including the head of the prison.In 2001, Guzman paid prison guards to help him escape from the high-security Puente Grande prison in the Mexican city of Guadalajara. After he was finally recaptured in 2014, President Enrique Pena Nieto said that another El Chapo escape must “never happen again.”]]></description>

Ryan Orellana-Moczynski, 25, from St John, Indiana, was swimming on a boogie board about a block away from the 2nd Avenue Pier around 7:45pm when a shark bit him. Beach Patrol Sergeant Phillip Cain said sharks typically feed around dusk and advised people to not swim at that time. Orellana-Moczynski may have swam into a school of fish that the shark was feeding on. He was sent to Grand Strand Regional Medical Center and had successful surgery Saturday night.]]></description>

      <title>US security: US - Mexico border fence unrealistic, Israel company to build digital wall</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Ahead of the 2016 United States presidential election, a number of Republican hopefuls have again made US border protection a key issue and several have suggested that border walls are a key solution. The history of U.S. border protection, however, shows how unfeasible the idea of a bricks-and-mortar wall is. The construction of the so-called 2,000-mile-long “Border Wall” began in 1993 between San Diego and Tijuana. However, by 2006, only 14 miles of the fence had been completed at a cost of $39 million dollars. By 2011, 646 miles of the fence was scattered along the southwest border, with 299 miles of the existing wall made up of vehicles barriers built at an approximate cost of $1.7 million per mile and 350 miles of pedestrian fencing, built at an estimated cost of $6.5 million per mile.The project proved too expensive to finish.That same year, under the Obama administration, a virtual wall using mobile surveillance and unmanned drones covering the entire 2,000-mile border, was announced at a cost of over $7 billion. A pilot program with 53 miles of virtual surveillance was launched in Arizona. After $1 billion was spent, that project was also abandoned due to its inability to meet standards for viability and cost effectiveness.But the problem is not only financial. Physical walls have not deterred immigrants from making the trip across the border.Instead, the walls have caused a rise in migrant deaths as migrants still attempt the crossing, but in more remote and risky border areas. While doing little to prevent illegal immigration, walls create many environmental problems such as the erosion of mountains, the dumping of erosion waste into rivers and consequential flooding. A physical wall along the entire US-Mexico border is unrealistic and is not a viable solution to the United States’ immigration woes. And equally costly, virtual walls both eliminate some of the environmental issues with building a physical wall, but also invite new questions regarding the privacy rights of Americans as well as health concerns.]]></description>

      <title>Utah-Arizona flood: Flash flood kills eight and sends two vehicles downstream</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Flash flooding ravaged a Utah town best known as the former home base for imprisoned polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs. The town of Hildale on the Utah-Arizona border was hit by a flash flood that swept away two vehicles, killing at least eight people and leaving five missing. On Monday evening, the canyons above Hildale received intense rain and, within minutes, Hildale was flooded. Witness Chris Wyler told CNN the flash flood happened very quickly, within half an hour. A full-size van and an SUV carrying a total of 16 people, mainly women and children, were hit by a wall of water that sent the two vehicles hundreds of yards downstream.

      <title>Volkswagen scandal: 11 million cars worldwide affected by emissions test-beating cheat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Automobile manufacturer Volkswagen has admitted to cheating on emissions tests, which in turn has affected 11 million cars worldwide.Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency say Volkswagen has installed an algorithm in vehicles that switches the emissions-control on and off when one of their diesel-powered cars undergo emissions testing.Diesel engines are more durable, while diesel fuel is also cheaper and can have up to 30 percent more mileage in a gallon of fuel than petrol-powered vehicles. However, isel engines emit more nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which could result in smog formation, according to VOX Explained.According to VOX Explained, an independant group  International Council on Clean Transportation  joined forces with researchers from West Virginia University when they noticed varied emission rates during field-testing of two Volkswagen vehicles. Volkswagen admitted to tampering with the emissions test when the EPA reportedly threatened to not approve the 2016 line of diesel-powered vehicles.According to the EPA, the algorithm tracks steering wheel position, pedal movements and atmospheric pressure to determine whether the vehicle is in a lab for testing. Full emissions control will be turned on during testing and off during normal driving conditions to maximize engine performance.The cheat has resulted in vehicles emitting up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides than what is considered standard, the EPA said.Volkswagen may be fined up to US$18 billion for violating the Clean Air Act.]]></description>

      <title>Pope Francis in the US: Pope opts for a modest Fiat and Jeep Wrangler as his popemobiles</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twPope Francis will be travelling in a newly modified Jeep Wrangler for most of the duration of his trip in the United States. However, the pontiff started his U.S. tour this Tuesday in a black Fiat 500L that was waiting for him on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews, reported the Telegraph.The modest Fiat tops at 100 miles per hour, about 60 miles per hour less than the Mercedes-Benz Pope Benedict used when he was in the U.S. in 2008.The Pope has opted for the Jeep Wrangler to be an open-sided vehicle so that he can be closer to the people. However, this also puts the pontiff at greater risk. The bottom of the vehicle is reportedly fitted with blast-proof technology to protect him in case there are explosives on the road, according to the International Business Times.Pope Francis had also compared the feeling of being inside a traditional Popemobile with a bullet-proof glass enclosure to being stuck in a ‘sardine can,’ and prefers the open-sided popemobile to get closer to his ministry, reported La Vanguardia, an Italian paper.“It’s true that anything could happen, but let’s face it, at my age I don’t have much to lose,” Pope Francis said to a Barcelona newspaper. “I know that something could happen to me, but it’s in the hands of God.”Over the course of his papacy, Pope Francis has used modified Mercedes, Toyotas, Kias, and Hyundais among others as modes of transportation. The Pope will continue his U.S. tour to the Capitol on Thursday.]]></description>

About half a minute later, copilot Andreas Lubitz set the plane’s autopilot to fly the plane to the lowest possible altitude, 100 feet, and increased the rpm in both of the plane’s engines. After a short while, the pilot tried to re-enter the cockpit. He used the intercom system to ask Lubitz to open the cockpit door, but received no answer. The pilot started knocking and can then be heard trying to break the door down. The plane crashed less than a minute later, killing all 150 people on board.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Amtrak engineer hit emergency brake before train derailed in Philadelphia, NTSB says</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAn engineer used an emergency brake moments before Amtrak Train 188 derailed in Philadelphia on Tuesday night at more than 100 miles per hour, according to National Transportation Safety Bureau official Robert Sumwalt, as reported by NBC.At least seven people were killed and more than 200 injured in the derailment.According to Sumwalt, the train was placed into engineered-induced braking moments before the derailment, meaning engineers applied the full emergency braking application. While the maximum speed at the curve was 50 mph, Sumwalt said the train was traveling at 106 mph when the engineer induced the brake application. Three seconds later the train speed was at 102 mph after the brake was applied and then it fully derailed, according to Sumwalt.Amtrak’s Northeast Regional Train 188 derailed Tuesday at around 9.30 p.m. in Philadelphia’s Port Richmond section along the Delaware River. The train was en route from Washington, DC to New York. The accident disrupted services along the Northeast Corridor, which runs from Boston to Washington and is the busiest and most congested passenger railroad in the United States. The Northeast Corridor served 11.6 million passengers in 2014 and has more than 2,200 commuter and freight trains operating from Boston to Washington each day.The train was heading into a bend in the track near Frankford Junction when it went off the tracks at a point where a 70 mph stretch turns into a 50 mph curve.

He then stole a pickup but was caught almost 12 hours later after leading police on a 40-kilometre high-speed chase, Australia’s ABC News reported.Jamieson had been in segregation after being identified as a suspect over the discovery of a 60-cm-deep hole in the prison’s floor, which was found earlier in August.According to the Australian, on Wednesday morning, another prisoner, Beau Wiles, 25, escaped from the Goulburn Correctional Centre around 10 a.m.after he jumped one of the prison’s fences.Wiles was serving an 18-month sentence for shoplifting, assault, robbery, car theft and driving while disqualified.Goulburn Correctional Centre is a maximum and minimum security institution for males located in the Southern Tablelands, 197 kilometers southwest of Sydney.SOURCES: United States Patent and Trademark Office, Quartz, News.com.auhttp://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&docid=20150274298&IDKey=0410F6F462F7&HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPG01%2526S1%3D20150274298%2526OS%3D20150274298%2526RS%3D20150274298http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/enjoy-the-space-on-planes-while-youve-got-it/story-fn6yjmoc-1227559525929***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFrench airplane maker Airbus has filed patents in Europe and the United States for split-level passenger seating configurations  an idea which has been likened to stacking passengers like blocks.In the document, published with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on October 1, several illustrations depict possible futures wherein flyers would be arranged in alternating rows on upper and lower levels. The document presents the idea as a way to make better use of unused “upper lobe” space in wide-bodied models such as the A380.The economic benefits to airlines are obvious. The proposed seating configurations would allow airlines to fit more people into a plane than they do currently. And with what it calls mezzanine seating, more passengers could recline to a flat-lying position, a setup the patent application suggests would be “suitable” for use in business class sections.But flyers may not be ready for these controversial ideas.

      <title>Flight MH17 shot down by Russian-made Buk missile, Dutch report says</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twMalaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine by a Russian-made Buk missile, the Dutch Safety Board concluded on Tuesday in its final report on the crash in July 2014 that killed all 298 people on board. The board however did not point the finger at any group or party for firing the missile. At the time of the crash, a war was raging in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces when the aircraft was downed. “A 9N314M warhead detonated outside the airplane to the left side of the cockpit. This fits the kind of warhead installed in the Buk surface-to-air missile system,” said the Safety Board head Tjibbe Joustra. Russia disputes that a Buk may have been used. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov responded to the findings by saying there had been “an obvious attempt to draw a biased conclusion, and carry out political orders,” according to Russian news agencies. The makers of the Buk said their tests had shown that the aircraft could not have been hit by a missile launched from rebel-controlled territory. The safety board’s report said that a 9N314M warhead had exploded to the left of the plane’s flight cabin, sending shrapnel towards the aircraft with “tremendous force.”The detonation killed three crew members in the cockpit instantly and caused the breakup of the plane, which exploded when it hit the ground tail-first. The report said shrapnel fragments all pointed to a ground-launched Buk missile. Joustra said it was likely that passengers not killed by the impact of the missile would have been rendered unconscious very quickly by the sudden decompression of the plane and the lack of oxygen at 33,000 feet.

      <title>Russia and the ESA set sites on permanent moon colony with planned landing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe European Space Agency and its Russian counterpart are sending a lander to the moon’s south pole as part of their plan to settle humans permanently on Earth’s closest neighbor.In one of a number of missions led by the Russian Federal Space Agency, it and the ESA hope to land the Luna 27 probe on the moon’s South Pole Aitken Basin in 2020. The spacecraft’s mission is to assess whether or not there is enough raw material on the moon’s surface to support human life during future missions. As parts of the south pole are shielded from the heat of the sun, the region is darker and colder than other sections of the moon. The environment has allowed water to collect and freeze at the surface of the moon and scientists say that this water could be used as a potential resource for the future.The ESA already has ideas about what these future missions may be as the agency hopes to build lunar habitats in the lunar south pole as early as 2024. The agency plans to deploy inflatable domes on the moon’s surface as shelter for astronauts. 3D-printing robots will be sent to the moon and will be used to build a layer of dirt around the domes.The ESA says the lunar base they hope to build within the next decade could replace the International Space Station as the new base for astronauts to experience life in space. Scientists also hope that the moon base will help astronauts prepare for later missions to Mars. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Location of the probe landing site on the moon2.

      <title>White House has plan to counter catastrophic solar storms</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNo internet. No mobile phones. No electricity to power refrigerators, run the vacuum cleaner or keep the lights on. No respite for weeks or possibly months. No Netflix. This is what would happen should a massive solar storm hit Earth, the threat of which the White House is taking seriously.In October, the White House published a 19-page paper outlining preparations and responses to massive solar electromagnetic pulses (EMP) that could potentially cripple key infrastructure.Dubbed the “National Space Weather Strategy,” the document calls for more studies on potential effects of space weather on power grids; more research to better model and predict space weather; and more cooperation among scientists and agencies at the international level, among other proposals.Scientists for years have warned of the potential dangers of solar EMPs. In 2013, insurance company Lloyd’s of London estimated the economic fallout as high as $2.6 trillion should a massive storm hit.Space weather can be traced to coronal mass ejections, or huge bursts of gas most often associated with solar flares. These solar storms send huge quantities of electromagnetic radiation toward Earth. That’s not good for power grids. A solar EMP could take entire power grids offline, plunging the world into darkness. In 1859, one of the biggest solar storms ever recorded hit Earth, in what scientists now call the Carrington event. Society before the start of the Civil War didn’t depend on electricity as we do today. So the impact was limited to disrupted telegraph lines and shocked telegraph operators. But the world today wouldn’t get off so easy. In 1989, a much smaller solar storm caused the collapse of Hydro-Quebec’s electricity transmission system, resulting in a nine-hour power outage.In 2012, we got lucky. Scientists observed a solar storm believed to be as big the Carrington event. Fortunately, because the sun rotates on its own axis, Earth was facing away from the storm and missed it by about nine days.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of coronal mass ejection2.

Her airbag failed failed to deploy properly, instead exploding with shrapnel and causing damage to her neck and head.Earlier this year several car manufacturers, including Honda, recalled nearly 34 million cars over problems with Takata airbags. Inside airbags is an inflator, which is filled with propellant granules and propellants, reported Reuters. Unlike most brands, Takata-designed propellants are made from ammonium nitrate.  If exposed to high humidity, the propellants can end up damaged, which causes them to produce excess pressure inside the inflator, making it crack and explode.During the crash Johnston’s trachea was severed and vocal chords damaged by a piece of shrapnel, reported the Salt Lake Tribune. As a result she cannot currently speak and is suing several corporations including Takata and Honda for her injuries.Johnston can only communicate by writing on a notepad and her family are uncertain if she’ll ever get her voice back, reported KUTV.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twMysterious debris surrounding a star that scientists earlier this year posited may be an alien megastructure is actually likely to be just comets, according to NASA.The space agency used its Spitzer Space Telescope to observe infrared light data from the star, KIC 8462852, to test for other possibilities of what the debris maybe. NASA explained that if planetary impact or an asteroid collision was the cause of the debris, there would have been excess infrared light surrounding the star.

      <title>Graphene solar panels could generate electricity from raindrops</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twScientists in China are producing solar panels that can produce energy from the last source you’d expect  rainwater.In a study published in the journal Angewandte Chemie, researchers in China introduced a new type of solar panel that adds a layer of graphene, or carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure, to dye-sensitized solar cells. A flexible layer of indium tin oxide and plastic is included underneath.Graphene has unusual properties that allow electrons to move freely throughout the entire layer. According to the researchers, rainwater contains positively charged ions like ammonium, calcium and sodium. When water binds to the panel’s surface, a double-layer of positive ions and negatively charged electrons is created, which ends up producing a voltage and current.Tests of the new solar panels have been able to produce hundreds of microvolts, which is small even compared to a standard AA battery, reports Quartz. The solar-to-electric energy conversion stood at about 7 percent, which is much lower than the 20 percent energy conversion achieved by the best solar panels on the market. So there’s a long way to go before the new solar panels become more widely used. But more efficient future versions could mean big things for the solar industry.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Radiation still a concern 30 years after Chernobyl blast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThirty years after a botched experiment resulted in a catastrophic nuclear disaster, engineers are still working to contain the radiation.Reuters reports that on April 26, 1986, an explosion tore through a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Pripyat, Ukraine. It sent deadly clouds of atomic material into the air and is considered to be the world’s worst nuclear accident.Months after the blast, a concrete sarcophagus was built over Reactor 4 to contain the radioactive material inside. Years later, radiation is still present. A recent investigation carried out by the Associated Press showed that milk from nearby farms contained a radioactive isotope 10 times higher than the allowed limit.With the sarcophagus having since deteriorated, engineers are currently building a giant stainless steel arch more than 350 feet high and 500 feet long to replace it, according to the Wall Street Journal. Called the New Safe Confinement, the 36,000-ton structure will be wheeled in place upon its completion in 2017, effectively sealing the sarcophagus.Giant hover cranes in the arch will then disassemble and clean up the exploded reactor contained inside, reports National Geographic.More than 40 countries donated funding for the arch, which is expected to prevent further leaks for the next 100 years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Aerospace firm patents solar window shade that can charge electronic devices</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twB/E Aerospace has filed a patent for a solar window shade that can charge electronic devices in an airplane.The device is designed with solar panels on the outer surface to receive sunlight, which would convert solar energy into power. The shades, which would be equipped with wired or wireless charging ports, would allow passengers to directly plug in their devices.The high tech window shade weighs only slightly more than an ordinary window shade (29-50 grams), according to B/E Aerospace. The company also claims it will actually “generate more energy than the extra fuel required” to carry it.B/E Aerospace says a single 737 making six 1000 nautical mile trips everyday would save around $22,000, conserve over 7300 gallons of fuel per year, and reduce 154,000 pounds of CO2 emissions.Modern planes that are equipped with traditional power points or USB outlets are powered by the plane’s internal electrical system. These systems require long lengths of wiring and interconnections, which add significant cost and weight to the interior construction of the plane, B/E Aerospace says.B/E Aerospace’s patent filing states the shade could easily be adapted for use on current airplanes or other aircraft, and requires no change to the rest of a cabin’s components.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>California may end observance of daylight saving time</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twCalifornia may soon join Arizona and Hawaii as the only states without daylight saving time.A bill to end the state’s observance of daylight saving time has cleared its first committee. Assembly Bill 385 needs to gain approval by a two-thirds majority of both houses of the California Legislature and be signed by Governor Jerry Brown. The measure would then be put before the public for a referendum, asking voters whether or not the state should eliminate the practice.Proponents of the bill say that altered summertime hours lead to a higher risk of health issues stemming from interrupted sleep cycles.According to a study presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 68th Annual Meeting in April, overall rate for stroke was 8 percent higher in the two days after daylight saving time. Cancer victims were 25 percent more likely to have a stroke during that time, and people older than 65 were 20 percent more likely to have a stroke. A study conducted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that the changing of clocks in spring for daylight saving time is associated with a 10 percent increase in risk of heart attacks.Opponents of the bill argue the practice saves energy, which was one of its original intended purposes.A Department of Energy report released in 2008 found that U.S. electricity use was decreased by 0.5 percent for each day of the extended DST, resulting in a savings of 0.03 percent for the year as a whole. Those savings amount to 1.3 billion kilowatt-hours, enough to power about 122,000 average U.S. homes for a year. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Daylight saving time: spring forward2. Daylight saving time: fall back3. Hour and sunlight differences4. Energy savings5. Health risks6. Areas that observe daylight saving timeVOICEOVER (in English): “Daylight saving time was introduced to conserve energy during wartime. In spring, clocks are turned one hour forward,""so that the evening lasts one hour longer without sacrificing normal sunrise times. During the fall, clocks are readjusted back one hour to normal, standard time.” “The practice allows for more natural sunlight hours, thereby reducing the need to use electricity to power lights in the evening.”“Supporters of daylight saving time say the practice conserves energy. A Department of Energy report released in 2008 found that due to daylight saving time, the U.S. saved 1.3 billion kilowatt-hours, enough to power about 122,000 average U.S. homes for a year.”“Opponents of daylight saving time argue that altering clocks lead to greater health risks. Studies show that in the days following daylight saving time, the overall rate for stroke  was 8 percent higher. The rate for heart attacks was 10 percent higher. The rates correspond to the effects of sleep deprivation.”“Only 70 countries and 48 states currently observe daylight saving time.

      <title>Survival Capsule designed to save lives during tsunami</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA new emergency shelter, the Survival Capsule, was designed to help save lives during a tsunami.The 2011 tsunami off Japan’s coast that was triggered by the Tōhoku earthquake, killing almost 16,000 people and injuring 6,000 more, was what inspired Julian Sharpe and Scott Hill to create the Survival Capsule. Sharpe and Hill designed to capsule with the less-mobile  the elderly, the infirm, and the young  in mind.The Survival Capsule team entered the concept in a May 2011 NASA Tech Brief competition and placed ninth out of 350 entries. In emergency situations, the survival capsule could act as a safety shelter for those who have problems evacuating, especially on last-minute’s notice. The capsules are spherical metal cages sheathed in aircraft-grade aluminum shells to absorb impact. The internal walls are lined with ceramic thermal blankets to protect passengers from extreme heat. Each capsule is equipped with 60-minute air tank in case it is submerged under water. Tsunami waves typically move at around 25 mph, but the Survival Capsule’s tests have found that the capsule can withstand impacts from objects at up to 75 mph.Capsules are available for pre-order in five different capacities ranging from two to 10 people each, with varying seating designs.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twAustralian researchers have developed a special robot that can herd cattle in large, rugged terrain that may eventually replace farmers and herding dogs.The robot is known as the SwagBot. It is a battery-operated, omnidirectional ground vehicle developed by Australian Centre for Field Robotics.The SwagBot can move as fast as 20 kilometers per hour on smooth terrain. During its first field test, the robot demonstrated that it can also navigate through rugged terrain.“The trial has been very successful so far, so it’s given us the confidence to move to the next phase,” Salah Sukkarieh of the University of Sydney, the leader of the trial told New Scientist.The team is working on algorithms that will allow the SwagBot to detect changes in body temperature and postures of the cattle in order to monitor their health. It will also be equipped with colour and shape sensors to identify a good pasture land for the cattle.According to the New Scientist, the Swagbot will be the first robot in the world to be able to monitor the health of livestock if the algorithms are tested successfully.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Luxury cruise ship Crystal Serenity prepares to enter Arctic waters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twHigh-end tourism came to one of the last wildernesses on the planet on Tuesday, when a huge luxury cruise ship entered Arctic waters.The Crystal Serenity is 82 feet long and weighs more than 68,000 tons. The ship is carrying around 1,000 passengers, who have each paid upwards of $22,000 for a trip only made possible by the melting of ice in the notoriously treacherous waters of the Northwest Passage linking the Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans.The ship left Seward, Alaska last week and docked in the city of Nome on Monday, its last stop before entering Arctic waters, Crystal Berg reported.The ship’s sold-out voyage has raised concerns among the green lobby, who believe it is taking advantage of climate change and could lead to environmental damage in the Arctic by opening the gates to more cruise ships.The Crystal Serenity is accompanied by an ice-breaking boat and two helicopters. The ship is expected to stop in Greenland as it makes its way through the Northwest Passage to New York.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Crystal Serenity carrying 1,000 tourists paying at least $22,000 each2.

      <title>Your car&#x2019;s side window may be making one side of your body age faster</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThis animation was originally published in May 2016.A study has shown that while the windshields of cars may block a majority of harmful rays from vehicle drivers and passengers, side windows aren’t as effective. The study, published in JAMA Ophthalmology, found that car door windows offered varying levels of protection from the rays that are tied to cataracts and skin aging.Brian Boxer Wachler, of the Boxer Wachler Vision Institute in Beverly Hills, analyzed the ultraviolet protection provided by the glass in 29 cars from 15 different automobile manufacturers made from 1990 to 2014.Boxer Wachler’s research found that while front windshields blocked an average of 96 percent of UV-A rays, side windows only blocked 71 percent. Overall, only 14 percent of the cars offered a high level of side-window UV-A protection.UV rays account for a small portion of the sun’s rays but are the most damaging to human skin. UV-A rays are not filtered by the ozone layer and can penetrate through the second layer of skin.Because drivers in the U.S. have their left side exposed to sunlight, UV rays have been blamed for the increased number of cataracts and skin cancers that occur on the left side. Boxer Wachler believes the insufficient protection provided by car side windows could be a contributing factor.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Range of cars that were analyzed in new study2.

      <title>Perlan Mission II set to take flight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twAn Oregon-based company is on the verge of sending the first aircraft to sustained flight at 90,000 feet, higher than any other winged aircraft has flown.The not-for-profit Perlan Project partnered with Airbus Group to launch Airbus Perlan Mission II in 2002 to send an aircraft far into the stratosphere in order to harvest data about Earth’s atmosphere and ozone layer.At 90,000 feet, temperatures dip below -70 degrees celsius and air density is just two percent of sea-level air density, conditions similar to those on the surface of Mars.  The Perlan 2 is a purpose-built pressurized high-altitude glider, that it hopes can sustain a pilot in high stratospheric conditions. The Perlan 2 uses the thrust from atmospheric mountain wind in order to stay afloat, similar to how a surfer rides an ocean wave.Studies have found that the Polar Vortex, and the stratospheric polar night jet, existing only in winter, provide the high-speed wind in the stratosphere that power incredibly high waves, those needed to fly the Perlan 2.The Perlan 2 is slated to soar sometime this year.

Polar vortex and night jetVOICEOVER (in English): In 2002, the Perlan Project embarked on a mission to send an aircraft far into the stratosphere to harvest data about Earth’s atmosphere and ozone layer.At 90,000 feet, temperatures dip to -70 degrees celsius and air density just is two percent of air-density at sea level, conditions similar to those on the surface of Mars.  The non-profit developed the Perlan 2, a purpose-built pressurized high-altitude glider, that it hopes can sustain high stratospheric conditions. The Perlan 2 will carry scientific instruments and a crew of two in a pressurized cabin. The aircraft has a gross weight of 1,800 pounds and a wingspan of 84 feet. Its flight speed at 90,000 feet will be around 403 miles per hour. The Perlan 2 uses the thrust from atmospheric mountain wind in order to stay aloft. There are three kinds of mountain winds.   A ridge lift is created by winds blowing over mountains, hills or other ridges. Air is deflected upward forming a band of lift. Gliders on this wind stay close to the ridge.Thermals are columns of air created from the heat rising from Earth’s surface. As sun heats up air, it becomes less dense and rises. As the air rises is it cooled in higher altitudes and sinks.  A thermal is created when there is uneven heating of the earth’s surface, creating columns of hot air. A wave lift, is similar to a ridge lift, but it is created on the leeward side of the peak. It requires constant winds that increase in velocity at higher altitudes. The winds are uplifted by turbulent rotors formed by the effects of thermal columns.The Perlan 2 will use all three winds to reach 90,000 feet to sustain flight on a wave lift.Studies have found that the Polar Vortex and polar night jet, existing only in winter, provide the high-speed wind in the stratosphere that power incredibly high waves, those needed to fly the Perlan 2.SOURCES: Perlan Project, Air and Space Magazine, http://www.perlanproject.org/http://www.airspacemag.com/ist/?next=/flight-today/sailplane-stratosphere-180959154/***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a weight loss device that uses an external pump to drain stomach contents into the toilet.The device, known as the AspireAssist, is manufactured by Pennsylvania company Aspire Bariatrics. It is roughly the size of a smartphone and can be easily stored in a small bag.AspireAssist is connected to a port on the user’s stomach, which is installed via surgery. The food flows into a pre-installed tube inside the stomach into the device once the lever is switched on, and drains directly into the toilet.The user can pump some water into the stomach with the device’s reservoir to loosen the food particles inside the stomach when experiencing blockage.The company says only a third of the food will be drained, so that the body still has enough calories to function.The device has been called “assisted bulimia” by some critics. Its side effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea.The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 38 percent of American adults and 17 percent of teenagers are obese.The FDA has approved AspireAssist to be used on adults with a body mass index of 35 to 55 who have not been able to lose weight with other methods.

      <title>California may end observance of daylight saving time</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twCalifornia may soon join Arizona and Hawaii as the only states without daylight saving time.A bill to end the state’s observance of daylight saving time has cleared its first committee. Assembly Bill 385 needs to gain approval by a two-thirds majority of both houses of the California Legislature and be signed by Governor Jerry Brown. The measure would then be put before the public for a referendum, asking voters whether or not the state should eliminate the practice.Proponents of the bill say that altered summertime hours lead to a higher risk of health issues stemming from interrupted sleep cycles.According to a study presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 68th Annual Meeting in April, overall rate for stroke was 8 percent higher in the two days after daylight saving time. Cancer victims were 25 percent more likely to have a stroke during that time, and people older than 65 were 20 percent more likely to have a stroke. A study conducted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that the changing of clocks in spring for daylight saving time is associated with a 10 percent increase in risk of heart attacks.Opponents of the bill argue the practice saves energy, which was one of its original intended purposes.A Department of Energy report released in 2008 found that U.S. electricity use was decreased by 0.5 percent for each day of the extended DST, resulting in a savings of 0.03 percent for the year as a whole. Those savings amount to 1.3 billion kilowatt-hours, enough to power about 122,000 average U.S. homes for a year. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Daylight saving time: spring forward2. Daylight saving time: fall back3. Hour and sunlight differences4. Energy savings5. Health risks6. Areas that observe daylight saving timeVOICEOVER (in English): “Daylight saving time was introduced to conserve energy during wartime. In spring, clocks are turned one hour forward, so that the evening lasts one hour longer without sacrificing normal sunrise times. During the fall, clocks are readjusted back one hour to normal, standard time.” “The practice allows for more natural sunlight hours, thereby reducing the need to use electricity to power lights in the evening.”“Supporters of daylight saving time say the practice conserves energy. A Department of Energy report released in 2008 found that due to daylight saving time, the U.S. saved 1.3 billion kilowatt-hours, enough to power about 122,000 average U.S. homes for a year.”“Opponents of daylight saving time argue that altering clocks lead to greater health risks. Studies show that in the days following daylight saving time, the overall rate for stroke  was 8 percent higher. The rate for heart attacks was 10 percent higher. The rates correspond to the effects of sleep deprivation.”“Only 70 countries and 48 states currently observe daylight saving time. Arizona and Hawaii are two states that opt out of daylight saving time.”SOURCES: The Sacramento Bee, Department of Energy, CNN, American Academy of Neurology, University of Alabama at Birminghamhttp://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article83558137.htmlhttp://energy.gov/articles/top-8-things-you-didn-t-know-about-daylight-saving-timehttp://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/health/daylight-saving-time-health-effects/https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/1440https://www.uab.edu/news/focus-on-patient-care/item/2141-heart-attacks-rise-following-daylight-saving-time***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Study shows giant sinkholes in Texas expanding</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twSatellite images show that two massive sinkholes near Wink, Texas are growing, and that more sinkholes are forming nearby, according to geophysicists at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, who reported their findings in the journal Remote Sensing.The sinkholes, named Wink 1 and Wink 2, are located between the small towns of Wink and Kermit in West Texas.The scientists said the sinkholes are unstable and subsiding at an alarming rate. More sinkholes could appear in the future, and they could collapse into one giant sinkhole. A collapse of the sinkholes, because they are near two towns as well as oil and gas facilities, could be catastrophic, the scientists warned.“This area is heavily populated with oil and gas production equipment and installations, hazardous liquid pipelines, as well as two communities. The intrusion of freshwater to underground can dissolve the interbedded salt layers and accelerate the sinkhole collapse,” Jin-Woo Kim, leader of the study and research scientist at Southern Methodist University, said in a statement. Wink 2 is about 3 kilometers from the town of Wink, which has a population of 940 people. Wink 1 is about 6 kilometers from the town of Kermit, which is home to 6,000 people.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Sinkhole formed naturally2. Sinkhole formed by oil drilling3. Location of the two sinkholes in Texas4. Dimensions of the two sinkholes5. Deformation and subsidence rate of Wink 16. Deformation and subsidence rate of Wink 27. Location of potential new giant sinkhole8. Ground near a road subsiding9. Distance between the sinkholes and population of the nearby townsVOICEOVER (in English): “Sinkholes form naturally when underground water dissolves bedrock, creating voids over time. The voids grow upward toward the surface until the layers above them collapse.”“Sinkholes can also be created by oil and gas extraction. Drilling factures underground rock and allows water to permeate and dissolve the interbedded salt, which creates voids underground.”“Scientists have discovered that two infamous sinkholes between the small towns of Wink and Kermit in West Texas, named Wink 1 and Wink 2, are expanding.”“Wink 1 is about 110 meters across, or roughly the size of a football field. Wink 2 is roughly 270 meters across.”“Wink 1 appears to be the more unstable of the two. It has a deformation area measuring about 500 meters wide and is subsiding up to 4 centimeters a year.”“Wink 2 is sinking up to 3 centimeters a year.” “New sinkholes or one giant sinkhole may form west of Wink 2. In addition, ground along a road used by oil field vehicles directly north of Wink 2 is also subsiding about 3 centimeters a year.”“Wink 2 is about 3 kilometers from Wink, which has a population of 940 people. Wink 1 is about 6 kilometers from Kermit, which has a population of 6,000.”SOURCES: Southern Methodist University, International Business Times, Science Daily, Gristhttp://blog.smu.edu/research/2016/06/13/geohazard-giant-sinkholes-near-west-texas-oil-patch-towns-are-growing-as-new-ones-lurk/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/texas-giant-unstable-sinkholes-are-growing-could-be-verge-catastrophic-collapse-1565636?utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=linkhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160614121526.htmhttp://grist.org/living/massive-sinkholes-in-texas-could-combine-to-form-even-massiver-sinkhole/***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide turned to stone in Iceland climate change experiment</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twResearchers are hailing a potential game-changer for climate change after successfully converting carbon to rock at a geothermal power plant in Iceland.The project could help to reduce global warming by burying the waste CO2 produced from burning fossil fuels, the Guardian reported.Scientists at the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant converted carbon dioxide into the volcanic rock basalt, according to a study published in the journal Science.The researchers pumped 230 tons of CO2 into rock 500 meters underground, dissolving the gas in water to prevent it from escaping. More than 95 percent of the gas turned to stone within two years, speeding up a natural process that takes hundreds or thousands of years, the Guardian reported.A potential problem for the technique is that it requires 25 tons of water for every ton of buried CO2. However, researchers said seawater can be used, which is abundant at coastal sites, the Guardian reported.The project is seen as an improvement on existing carbon capture and storage methods that store CO2 as a gas, causing concern about potential leaks.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Largest indoor vertical farm uses less water and produces more</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe world’s largest indoor vertical farm is well on its way to producing millions of pounds of food a year while using less water. Last December, AeroFarms Inc. secured $20 million in a Series B round of venture funding, paving the way for its 70,000 square foot facility in Newark, New Jersey, which the company says has the potential to produce 2 million pounds of food a year. Ground was broken on the facility last year and it is now nearing completion. It houses an efficient “aeroponic vertical farm” system that uses 95 percent less water than conventional commercial field farms and 40 percent less than hydroponic farms.Utilizing aeroponic and LED lighting systems, the farmers can monitor all the macro- and micronutrients of each plant, allowing AeroFarms to grow a plant in half the time of a commercial farm and with more productivity per square foot.Currently, AeroFarms has two facilities with the larger 70,000 square foot building nearing completion.

The test driver would note whether the honk was made appropriately.Google announced in its monthly report that the test results helped to improve its honking algorithms, promoting them to broadcast the honks to people outside the vehicle.For example, the Google vehicle would make two short beeps to remind another car that is slowly reversing towards it about its presence.It would make a long and loud beep in urgent situations such as a distracted pedestrian or an oncoming vehicle.The silent vehicle can also mimic the sound characteristics of traditional cars to help alert pedestrians and the visually impaired to the car’s presence.Google is testing 24 Lexus RX450h SUVs and 34 prototype cars, which are driving an average of 10,000 to 15,000 miles per week.Google self-driving cars have been involved in only one crash that was their fault.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe world’s longest and most expensive railway tunnel opens on Wednesday in Switzerland.The Gotthard Base Tunnel originates in Erstfeld in the canton of Uri and ends in Bodio in the canton of Tessin. Stretching 57 kilometers long, it will overtake Japan’s Seikan Tunnel and the Channel Tunnel between England and France as the world’s longest. At 2.3km under the Alps, it will also be the deepest railway tunnel in the world.The tunnel uses a system of two one-way tracks, linked by emergency escape routes. Trains travel on an almost entirely flat track and are able to reach maximum speeds of 250 kilometers per hour.The tunnel will cut the train journey time between Zurich and Milan by one hour to just about three hours.The tunnel will be also used for freight trains. About 260 freight trains will be able to use the tunnel per day, compared to a maximum of 180 trains using the current route.

      <title>Aerospace firm patents solar window shade that can charge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twB/E Aerospace has filed a patent for a solar window shade that can charge electronic devices in an airplane.The device is designed with solar panels on the outer surface to receive sunlight, which would convert solar energy into power. The shades, which would be equipped with wired or wireless charging ports, would allow passengers to directly plug in their devices.The high tech window shade weighs only slightly more than an ordinary window shade (29-50 grams), according to B/E Aerospace. The company also claims it will actually “generate more energy than the extra fuel required” to carry it.B/E Aerospace says a single 737 making six 1000 nautical mile trips everyday would save around $22,000, conserve over 7300 gallons of fuel per year, and reduce 154,000 pounds of CO2 emissions.Modern planes that are equipped with traditional power points or USB outlets are powered by the plane’s internal electrical system. These systems require long lengths of wiring and interconnections, which add significant cost and weight to the interior construction of the plane, B/E Aerospace says.B/E Aerospace’s patent filing states the shade could easily be adapted for use on current airplanes or other aircraft, and requires no change to the rest of a cabin’s components.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Solar powered floating farms could help feed the world</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA Barcelona-based company has developed a solar powered floating farm system that could ease growing food demand around the world.Smart Floating Farms, otherwise known as SFF, was developed by Forward Thinking Architecture. The idea was inspired by traditional grid-shape fish farms in Asia.The structure is 200 meters wide and 350 meters long, which is roughly the size of 6 football fields. They can be connected to form a cluster of modules.The floating farm has three levels: the top level is installed with photovoltaic panels to harvest sunlight for electricity and it has rainwater collectors for irrigation purposes; second level serves as a greenhouse for the vegetables, which are grown without soil under the hydroponic system; and the ground level is used as a fish farm on the open sea, as well as a fish egg hatchery, a slaughterhouse and a storage room for the fish.All the modules are centrally controlled by software via Cloud technology. The production data will be analysed and can be used to make comparisons on food needs for specific cities.Each SFF is estimated to have a maximum production of 8.152 tons of vegetables and 1.703 tons of fish per year. The floating farms are ideal for densely populated cities near coastal areas such as Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

They can be connected to form a cluster of modules.” “Photovoltaic panels are installed on the top level to harvest sunlight for electricity and it has rainwater collectors for irrigation purposes. Other renewable energy technologies such as micro wind turbines may also be added.”“The second level is a greenhouse for the vegetables, which are grown without soil under the hydroponic system. The plants receive natural light from the skylight openings.”“The ground level is used as a fish farm on the open sea, and features a fish egg hatchery, a slaughterhouse and a storage room for the fish.”“By using farms in nearby waters as a food source, the SFF can help reduce reliance on imported food.”“All the modules are centrally controlled by software via cloud technology. The production data will be analysed and can be used to make comparisons on the food needs for specific cities.”“Each SFF is estimated to have a maximum production of just over 8 tons of vegetables and slightly over 1.7 tons of fish per year.

      <title>Secret Service plans to double the size of White House fence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twWhite House security plans proposed by the Secret Service include a 14-foot barrier nearly twice the height of the current fence.The iron pickets on the planned fence are expected to be thicker, twice as high as those on the current fence, and spaced closer together. Sensors would be fitted to the back of the pickets’ sharp finials at 30-foot intervals, according to the plan proposed last month and published on the National Park Service website. The Secret Service also told planning commissions that the new fence would include anti-climb and anti-blast features.In light of the recent stream of “jumpers” that have attempted to break into the compound at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the Secret Service hopes this fence will keep intruders out. Fence jumping at the White House has become a regular occurrence, with two people climbing over the barrier last month and one jumper the day after Thanksgiving last year, according to the New York Times.However, critics of the new fence believe a balance must be struck between security, historical preservation and the spirit of democracy. The Secret Service must now seek approval from two federal boards for its plan, the New York Times reported. The plan will be reviewed this summer and planners expect construction of the fence to begin in 2018, according to the Washington Post.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Japanese startup plans to open 2020 Olympics with world&#x2019;s first man-made meteor shower</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA Japan-based startup hopes to open the 2020 Olympics with a bang by making hundreds of colored fireballs rain over Tokyo in the world’s first man-made meteor shower.Star-ALE’s “Sky Canvas” project would see the launch of a microsatellite carrying 500 to 1,000 pellets into space. A single pellet costs $8,100 and measures a couple centimeters in diameter. Once the satellite has stabilized its orbit around the Earth, it will then eject the pellets using a special device that has not been disclosed by Star-ALE. The pellets will travel about a third of the way around the Earth before entering the atmosphere and catching fire once they are 40 to 50 miles from the ground. Each are coated in different chemicals so that the pellets’ flames will emit different colors.The meteor shower will be visible even in the presence of Tokyo’s light pollution. Hurtling through the atmosphere at 7-8 kilometres per hour, the pellets will travel slower than natural shooting stars, Phys.org reported. This will give spectators ample opportunity to view the meteor shower. The developer of this expensive light show hopes that their artificial shooting stars will support future astronomical projects in Japan by igniting public interest in astronomy, the Christian Science Monitor reported.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Luxury cruise set to sail through perilous Northwest Passage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twOn August 16, a luxury cruise ship will begin a 32-day journey through the Northwest Passage  a melting but still treacherous waterway that connects the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean.The Crystal Serenity, measuring 820 feet long and weighing nearly 69,000 tons, is set to  cross through the Northwest Passage in less than a month. The ship will carry some 1,000 passengers on board, each of whom paid anywhere between $22,000 to $121,000 for the trip, reported the Washington Post.The cruise ship plans to set sail from Seward, Alaska and finish its journey in New York, with a UK-operated research ship called the RRS Ernest Shackleton traveling alongside during the long stretch over Canadian waters. Equipped with two helicopters, the smaller ship will also provide ice-breaking assistance if necessary, reported the Guardian.The Crystal Serenity will be set up with ice-detecting radar, two ice searchlights and thermal imaging equipment to scope out ice in the ship’s path during the day and night.Global warming has caused ice cover in the Arctic to significantly shrink over the last century. In light of this change, an increasing number of small cargo ships are now navigating the Northwest Passage. According to the Washington Post, in 2013, 13 ships made the journey across the waterway. In the summer of 2015, 20 ships passed through. Although it’s getting more traffic, the Northwest Passage is still a loosely defined passage, and boats can choose several routes. The Crystal Serenity will be the largest and most luxurious ship yet make this journey.Both the U.S. Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard have expressed concern about the trip because of the inevitably slow emergency response times in the Arctic. According to the Guardian, both conducted emergency exercises in April in preparation for emergencies involving the Serenity or other vessels that plan to pass through the icy waters this summer.The trip has been described as a “once-in-a-lifetime trip” for guests to visit areas that have largely off limits to anyone other than scientists or members of the military.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Humanoid robot dives for sunken shipwreck treasure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA humanoid diving robot developed at Stanford University could help scientists get to parts of the ocean that human divers just can’t reach.The OceanOne robot was deployed last month to retrieve sunken treasure from an ancient shipwreck off the coast of the French city of Toulon. It returned with a vase from La Lune, the flagship of France’s King Louis XIV, which sunk in 1664, Stanford News reported.The robot, which is roughly five feet long, is designed to take on tasks that are either dangerous or beyond the limits of divers. For example, it has no problem with lack of air supply, or the decompression sickness known as the bends, the Guardian reported.OceanOne is controlled by a pilot on the surface, who can see exactly what the robot sees through two forward-facing cameras, according to Stanford News.OceanOne’s hands are fitted with sensors, which provide haptic feedback to a joystick, allowing the operator to feel whether the robot is gripping something light or heavy, firm or delicate.The robot is powered by thrusters and navigates with sensors and cameras, which help it to compute how to avoid collisions.Researchers hope the robot can be used to study coral reefs located below depths that humans can dive to comfortably, Stanford News reported. There are also plans to enhance the robot’s sensitivity by adding tactile sensors to each finger.The vase recovered by OceanOne from the shipwreck was reportedly covered in ocean debris and smelled like raw oysters, but was in good condition, according to Stanford News.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Human Rights Watch exposes child labor at Indonesian tobacco farms</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twAccording to a 119-page Human Rights Watch report released on Wednesday, thousands of children as young as 8 years old work in Indonesia’s tobacco industry, which is the fifth largest in the world.The report includes more than 130 interviews with children who work on tobacco farms in Indonesia. It shows that the child laborers are being exposed to many hazards such as pesticides and nicotine while working on the farms. The report also calls for a traceable supply chain that could better expose and restrict cases of child labor.In some regions of Indonesia, children work alongside their parents at tobacco farms for as little as 73 cents to US$1.10 per day, if they receive wages at all. Their involvement goes largely unnoticed because of a lengthy supply chain that begins with local traders or village leaders pooling together the tobacco from farmers. The trader or village leader then sells the tobacco to a warehouse that repackages the tobacco before selling it to multinational or national tobacco companies elsewhere in Indonesia.According to Reuters, tobacco companies, who rarely question their supplier about their source, then distribute the tobacco to consumers worldwide.Indonesia has policies to counter child labor, and 15 is the minimum age to work, but the report claims laws governing this issue aren’t enforced. Tobacco companies could cut out the middle man and directly contract farmers to eliminate some oversight, but child labor would continue due to limited meaningful penalties, says Human Rights Watch. According to the report, it’s relatively easy for farmers to ignore efforts made by companies to dissuade them from using child labor. Human Rights Watch shared their report with multinational and Indonesian tobacco companies. Several multinational companies said they are currently trying to reduce child labor while none of the Indonesian companies gave a detailed response.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Google patents adhesive layer that sticks people to the hood of a car during road accidents</title>

It could also be better. It's very dependent on the chaos of the situation,” Bryant Walker Smith, professor at Stanford School of Law told San Jose Mercury News.The technology is aimed specifically at self-driving cars but Google said it can be applied on regular cars.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Ex-NASA engineer to plant one billion trees using drones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twOxford-based start-up BioCarbon Engineering, founded by former NASA engineer Lauren Fletcher, is planning to fight industrial deforestation by planting 1 billion trees a year using drones.In a video made by the company, BioCarbon Engineering explains that the drones would first fly above a selected area, map its level of deforestation and report back its potential for reforestation. Then automated planting drones carrying seed pods would fly one to two meters above the ground, following a pre-determined planting pattern, and fire germinated seeds into the soil.A small pressurized canister would provide the necessary propulsive force for the seed pods to easily penetrate the soil surface. The seed pods, filled with nutritious hydrogel to reduce the force of the seed’s impact with the soil, would then break open upon impact and allow the germinated seeds to grow. “Our technology is making it easier for ecosystem restoration groups, mining companies and forestry groups, both private and public, to plant the trees, where they need them, at a fraction of the time and cost,” Fletcher said in a statement on the company website.According to the Independent, one drone is able to plant 10 seeds per minute. With two operators controlling multiple drones, 36,000 trees could be planted in a single day.The drones are not yet ready for deployment, but the company has already attracted investment from French drone maker Parrot, which is expected to accelerate the development of the technology.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Drone-satellite hybrid to conduct surveillance from Earth&#x2019;s stratosphere</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThales Alenia Space is building a revolutionary Zeppelin-like airship designed for applications ranging from border surveillance to environmental management, according to a recent press statement released by the Cannes-based aerospace manufacturer.The Stratobus, made mainly of UV-resistant carbon fiber, will measure 70 to 100 meters long and 20 to 30 meters wide.Reaching an altitude of 20 kilometers in the atmosphere, which is higher than most aircraft, the Stratobus will have a view range of about 500 kilometers. Reaching this height allows the airship to serve a similar function as satellites do currently, including border and maritime surveillance, telecommunications, broadcasting and navigation, reported Phys.org.According to Thales Alenia Space, a ring around the Stratobus allows the airship to rotate and face the Sun no matter the season or time of day. After solar rays enter the airship through a transparent section of the outer envelope, the rays reflect off a mirror inside and onto a row of solar panels. Energy collected from the solar panels is then sent to the Stratobus’ nacelle where the airship’s ultra-light fuel cell and electrolyzer are both located. The fuel cell stores the energy used by the spaceship, while the electrolyzer converts water onboard into gas.Despite the high winds at these altitudes, two fuel-cell powered electric motors at the sides of the airship maintain the airship’s stability.While this idea has been in the works for some time, Thales recently announced the official launch of the project in April, which will have 24 development phases. The prototype will be ready for testing in 2018, and the airships are expected to become commercialized by 2020.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Length and width of the Stratobus2.

      <title>Survival Capsule designed to save lives during tsunami</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA new emergency shelter, the Survival Capsule, was designed to help save lives during a tsunami.The 2011 tsunami off Japan’s coast that was triggered by the Tōhoku earthquake, killing almost 16,000 people and injuring 6,000 more, was what inspired Julian Sharpe and Scott Hill to create the Survival Capsule. Sharpe and Hill designed to capsule with the less-mobile  the elderly, the infirm, and the young  in mind.The Survival Capsule team entered the concept in a May 2011 NASA Tech Brief competition and placed ninth out of 350 entries. In emergency situations, the survival capsule could act as a safety shelter for those who have problems evacuating, especially on last-minute’s notice. The capsules are spherical metal cages sheathed in aircraft-grade aluminum shells to absorb impact. The internal walls are lined with ceramic thermal blankets to protect passengers from extreme heat. Each capsule is equipped with 60-minute air tank in case it is submerged under water. Tsunami waves typically move at around 25 mph, but the Survival Capsule’s tests have found that the capsule can withstand impacts from objects at up to 75 mph.Capsules are available for pre-order in five different capacities ranging from two to 10 people each, with varying seating designs.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>NASA funds research into deep-sleep journey for Mars astronauts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twAstronauts might one day sleep their way to Mars by spending much of the long, arduous journey in hypothermic hibernation chambers.The trip from Earth to Mars takes approximately 200 days, one way. This presents several challenges. First, the long trip could take a psychological toll on astronauts. Second, life support systems (think living quarters, food galleries, etc.) for a round-trip journey lasting more than a year would significantly add to payload requirements. Having astronauts sleep much of the way could address both these challenges.NASA is funding research into the idea through its NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program. Last week, NASA awarded $500,000 in second-stage funding to Atlanta-based SpaceWorks Enterprises.SpaceWorks has drawn up ideas for a hibernation chamber, which it says would help reduce an astronaut’s “footprint” aboard a spacecraft to Mars. The chamber’s intranasal cooling system would lower the astronaut’s temperature by 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, significantly reducing metabolism. This is known as a “torpor-induced state using therapeutic hypothermia,” a procedure developed by medical doctors for the treatment of patients. While asleep, an astronaut would be fed via catheters attached to the thigh or chest, while another tube carries waste away. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation might be used to stave off muscle atrophy.As the astronauts approach Mars, the wake-up cycle begins. Warming pads slowly raise the body’s temperature. It takes roughly one hour for every 1 degree rise in body temperature. Fully awake after their long nap, the astronauts are ready to begin their Mars mission.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Superflares may have sparked life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twNew research suggests solar storms from a young Sun helped kickstart life on Earth.NASA reports that some 4 billion years ago, only 70 percent of the Sun’s energy was received by the Earth  not enough to warm the planet. Despite this, geological evidence shows our planet was a warm globe with liquid water. Scientists have long been puzzled by this, calling it the Faint Young Sun Paradox. But now there may finally be an explanation: superflares.Researchers from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center pieced together a timeline of the Sun’s evolution by analyzing data from NASA’s Kepler space telescope, which found stars resembling our Sun.Our Sun today produces superflares once every 100 years. The bulk of this energy is kept from reaching Earth by the planet’s strong magnetic field.When the Sun was much younger  only a few million years old  the flares were much more frequent and intense. The Earth then had a weaker magnetic field, allowing particles from solar storms to collide with nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere, breaking them into individual atoms. These, in turn, split carbon dioxide molecules into carbon monoxide and oxygen.Nitrogen combined with oxygen to form nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that would have warmed the planet enough for liquid water to exist. Energy from the solar particles may have also helped create complex compounds like DNA and RNA  the building blocks of life.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Chile&#x2019;s red tide outbreak is killing its fishing industry</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twChile’s growing red tide crisis is threatening not only marine life but also communities that depend on the sea for their livelihood.Red tide is a commonly recurring phenomenon in Chile, but the outbreak that has grown rapidly along the southern coast in the past weeks is one of the worst ever recorded, Reuters reports.The toxic microalgae blooms that have turned waters red produce toxins that are lethal to birds and marine creatures. Humans who consume contaminated seafood are also at a risk, as red tide poisoning is often debilitating and at times fatal, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Scientists point to El Nino’s key role in the outbreak, with warming ocean waters creating a friendly environment for algal blooms. But locals are blaming salmon farms that dumped contaminated fish into the sea last March, and possibly worsened the bloom.The outbreak has devastated nearby coastal communities and crippled the fishing industry. Tons of dead fish and shellfish have washed up on shore, leaving fishermen with no means to sustain a living, the Guardian reports.

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest floating wind farm to be built off the coast of Scotland</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twScotland’s notoriously strong winds could pan out to be a blessing in disguise after the Scottish government recently approved plans for a floating wind farm right off of the Scottish coast.According to the Guardian, Statoil, a Norwegian energy company, plans to build a floating wind farm 15 miles off the coast of Peterhead, Scotland by the end of 2017. The floating wind farm, called the Hywind floating wind farm, will consist of five, 258-meter-high floating wind turbines. Each will have a floating steel tube filled with ballast as their base and they will be tethered to the seafloor by three moorings.Each of the five wind turbines will have a six-megawatt capacity, and together they will be able to power an estimated 20,000 homes.Because they’re not actually attached to the seabed, these types of wind turbines are cheaper than traditional ocean turbines and can be placed in deeper waters. Existing offshore wind turbines, which need to stand on concrete or steel foundations, are expensive if anchored to depths greater than 40 meters, reported the Guardian.Statoil’s goal with this $232 million pilot project is to demonstrate a way to harness wind power that can increase the global market potential for turbines.Offshore wind is a key component of Europe’s plan to source 20 percent of its total energy consumption from renewables, reported the Independent.

      <title>Remarkable discovery about first humans in America found under Florida river</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA collection of fossils and artifacts retrieved from a sinkhole in a river on Florida’s Gulf Coast may provide some of the oldest evidence of human presence in North America.The Page-Ladson archaeological site, submerged 35 feet under Florida’s Aucilla River, was the site of several digs in the 1980s and 1990s. A new team that included researchers from Florida State University and Texas A&M University decided to follow up on decades-old research between 2012 and 2014. After more than a hundred dives into the sinkhole, the team published their findings last week in the journal Science Advances. The researchers discovered mastodon bones, fossilized dung and stone tools in the sinkhole that provide compelling evidence that humans spread across North America far earlier than archaeologists previously thought. According to their research paper, the stone tools recovered from the sinkhole include a biface, a stone that’s been manually sharpened on both ends. On a previous excavation at the site, archaeologists found an adult mastodon tusk that appeared to have human-made grooves along its surface, reported the Christian Science Monitor.Prehistoric humans called the Clovis culture were believed to have originally arrived in North America via a land bridge about 13,000 years ago  as mammoth bones and spearheads have revealed. However, according to the Guardian, some of the artifacts recently discovered within the Aucilla River date back to more than 14,550 years ago when the land bridge may not have existed.What these new discoveries suggest is that a land bridge from Siberia may not be the answer to how the first humans initially colonized North America. Moreover, evidence suggests that people were in North America before the Clovis. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Location of the sinkhole in Florida2.

      <title>Beekeepers in the U.S. lost 44 percent of their hives over the 12 months</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONEFor story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe Bee Informed Partnership has released its annual survey of the national health of bees in America, and yet again the number of colonies is shrinking. Bee hive losses have increased, according to the survey, which said U.S. beekeepers lost 44 percent of their hives from April 2015 to April 2016. Last year’s losses amounted to 40.6 percent. And losses in summer 2015 increased to 28.1 percent of hives, the same rate of loss for winter 2015.While hive losses are known and expected to increase during the winter, it is notable that the same losses are occurring during the summer, when bees should be thriving.Bee Informed  which describes itself as “a collaboration of efforts across the country from some of the leading research labs and universities in agriculture and science”  points to a few contributing factors. “A clear culprit is the varroa mite, a lethal parasite that can easily spread between colonies,” the company wrote in an article following the survey. “Pesticides and malnutrition caused by changing land use patterns are also likely taking a toll, especially among commercial beekeepers.” Africanized killer bees have been found to kill swarms in California. Bees pollinate fruits, nuts and vegetables. Some crops, such as almonds, are entirely dependant on honey bees. Around the world, bees and other pollinators are responsible for 35 percent of crops, worth an incredible $577 billion. The White House reported that honey bees contribute more than $15 billion to the U.S. economy annually.Data for the survey was collected from 5,700 beekeepers from 48 states.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The camp will include two Orion capsules currently being tested by NASA. The two capsules will link up with the larger habitat and laboratory modules. One of the Orions will also act as the brain of the vessel, providing navigation and communications systems, while the other acts as a backup.Lockheed Martin plans to launch the spacecraft in pieces, which will be assembled in space around the moon. Solar electric propulsion, which NASA is currently fine-tuning, would pre-deliver non-essential elements, like rovers or UAVs, to Mars orbit or the surface.With the base camp, astronauts would be able to better explore the Red Planet. They would be able to control drones and rovers on the surface of Mars in real-time, as opposed to the 20-minute delayed connection currently used between Mars and Earth.Later, modules could be added to allow astronauts to land on Mars and head to the base camp for the return trip to Earth.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Artificial intestine EndoBarrier could treat obesity and diabetes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twImperial College London has launched the trial use of a device known as the EndoBarrier, aimed at treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.The EndoBarrier, developed by GI Dynamics Inc., is a 60-centimeter-long plastic tube. It is placed at the end of the stomach into the small intestine via the mouth.The plastic surface prevents food from being digested by the intestine and tricks the brain into feeling full. This also provokes the production of glucagon-like peptide, a hormone that drives the production of insulin.“One of the great advantages of the EndoBarrier is that it does not rely on surgery or medication to achieve its effect. Using a lower cost and less invasive alternative to bypass surgery could enable us to treat thousands more people living with type 2 diabetes every year,” Professor Julian Teare from Imperial College London’s Department of Surgery and Cancer and the leader of the study said in a statement.The EndoBarrier has to be removed from the body after a year. Researchers hopes the metabolic changes made will be permanent even after the removal of the device.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. EndoBarrier placed in the human body2.

This is an unacceptable risk, and we want to ensure no student’s graduation day is ruined by the potential for avoidable injury,” the university told the Guardian.The mortarboard got its name from a similarly-shaped tool known as the hawk, which is used by bricklayers to hold cement. The mortarboard is made of a rigid piece of cardboard that allows it to keep its shape and spin when it is thrown.The Chronicle of Higher Education cited an incident reported in a 1979 paper in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, where a 17-year-old girl whose sight was impaired after being struck across the right eye by a mortarboard.In order to compensate the students’ loss of the tradition, UEA has suggested graduates to mime the action of tossing their hats, and to have an £8-photo-edit service digitally add the hats to the graduation photos.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Therefore, when a mortarboard is tossed up at high velocity, it is likely to fall with the same force.”“The velocity at which the hat comes down, in combination to the sharp corners of the mortarboard, can possibly cause severe injuries if it strikes someone.”SOURCES: The Guardian, BBC, Chronicle of Higher Education, Daily Presshttp://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/18/university-ban-on-mortarboard-throwing-well-photoshop-them-inhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-36320123http://chronicle.com/article/Danger-Falling-Hats/44277/http://articles.dailypress.com/2009-06-13/news/0906120072_1_graduation-hat-mortarboard***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>NASA detects atomic oxygen in Martian atmosphere</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor the first time in four decades, NASA has found oxygen in Mars’ atmosphere.The last time oxygen was detected in the Martian atmosphere was in the 1970s during NASA’s Viking and Mariner missions. This time around, atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere was detected by a specialized 747 jetliner that flies in Earth’s stratosphere. The jetliner is called the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, or SOFIA. Using a spectrometer that observes far-infrared waves, the California-based plane found oxygen atoms in one of the upper layers of Mars’ atmosphere, known as the mesosphere. According to a NASA statement released about the finding, scientists only detected half the amount of oxygen they expected, probably due to natural variations in Mars’ atmosphere. Atomic oxygen refers to a single oxygen atom and is different from the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere, which involves two oxygen atoms. Atomic oxygen is prevalent in space because ultraviolet radiation is constantly breaking apart oxygen molecules to create atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen in Mars’ atmosphere fits with scientists’ belief that Mars was once warm and wet, with a thicker atmosphere capable of sustaining water and even life. But, over time solar winds are said to have stripped away Mars’ atmosphere, causing the planet to become cold and barren.Studying the atomic oxygen in Mars’ atmosphere will help scientists understand how and why the life-sustaining gases that once covered Mars disappeared over the past billions of years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>TSA warns passengers to be at the airport three hours before their flight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twLengthy waits at airport security checks could reach epidemic levels in the United States this summer, when air travel usually peaks.The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is advising U.S. travelers to be at the airport three hours early, due to long security lines, ABC News reported. The TSA advisory comes after long waiting times resulted in thousands of missed flights and delays in airports across the country.Passengers who come unprepared, or those who bring more than the allowed number of carry-ons, contribute to the delay, the TSA said in a statement released on May 11.But with almost 3 million travelers passing through screening each day, the 42,350 agents employed by the TSA are simply not enough, according to NBC News.More than 700 new officers are set to be hired by June, but union leaders claim it would take at least 6,000 new staff to alleviate the congestion.Currently, the only other alternative is PreCheck, an expedited entry program which allows previously vetted passengers to bypass the long lines, for a fee of $85 to $100, valid for five years. As of March 1, only 9.3 million travelers were enrolled in PreCheck, a far cry from the TSA’s goal of 25 million fliers.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Long security lines at the airport2.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe first penis transplant in the United States was completed successfully earlier this month.Thomas Manning, 64, from Halifax, Massachusetts, was the recipient of the new organ, according to a news release by the Massachusetts General Hospital published on Monday.Manning developed penile cancer after a work accident in 2012. In order to save his life, doctors had to remove most of his penis.He received a new organ from a deceased donor during a 15-hour operation on May 8 and May 9, according to the hospital. The operation was successful and doctors expect Manning to resume normal urination and sexual function in the near future.“These proof-of-principle cases will help establish the techniques used in this procedure and will forge the path to future treatment of patients with significant pelvic and genitourinary tissue loss related to cancer, trauma or infection,” said Dicken S.C.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twMore than 50 law enforcement agencies across the United States are using a new system that gives police a safer way to catch fleeing suspects.Instead of firing ammunition and engaging suspects in a dangerous and potentially fatal car chase, the system uses two 4-1/2-inch projectiles packed with GPS satellite trackers. One end is coated with adhesive which allows them to stick to a moving vehicle. They are then loaded into a launcher mounted on the front of a police car. The technology, developed by a company named StarChase, has reportedly not been involved in a single fatality, injury, property damage or liability claim, according to CBS News.During a car chase, officers press a button on the control console in the car or on a key fob. This triggers the launcher, which uses compressed air to fire the projectile at a fleeing vehicle. Once it attaches, they can retreat safely and monitor the car’s location with the tracker. Suspects are tracked and later arrested.Authorities in Milwaukee, Wisconsin have been trialing StarChase since December.

      <title>Sonic nets could prevent bird strikes at airports</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twResearchers have found a new way to prevent bird strikes at airports using noise.Scientists from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia set up a sonic net zone at an airstrip. This used speakers and amplifiers to emit 24-hour sound to disrupt the birds’ communication.  Over 80 percent of the bird population near the airstrip area was reduced. as a result of the sonic net. The study was published in the journal Ecological Communications.“By playing a noise at the same pitch, we mask those sounds, making the area much riskier for the birds to occupy. The birds don't like it and leave the area around the airfields, where there is potential for tremendous damage and loss of life” said study lead author John Swaddle, a biology professor at the College of William and Mary in a press release.Between 1988 and 2013, 255 people were killed in bird strike incidents.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of bird strike responsible for 255 deaths between 1988 and 20132. Four methods used to deter birds; the methods did not stop the birds3. Sonic net set near the airstrip with noise level between a dishwasher and a restaurant4. The noise disrupts the bird communication5. Depiction of the number of birds in the area dropped 80 percent due to the sonic netVOICEOVER (in English): “Bird strikes are a serious problem for the global aviation industry ... and are blamed for 255 human deaths between 1988 and 2013.  “Traditional methods to tackle bird strike including shooting, poisoning, scaring them with dogs and capturing them. However, none of these methods are highly effective.”“Looking for a high-tech method to scare birds away from airports, researchers in Virginia set up a sonic net zone near an airstrip. It had speakers and amplifiers emitting noise between the decibel levels of a domestic dishwasher and a busy restaurant.” “The noise disrupted bird communication and forced them to go elsewhere.”“The experiment found that 80 percent of the bird population near the airstrip area was reduced as a result of the sonic net.”SOURCES: EurekAlert, Ecological Communication( Research Gate link),College of William & Mary, BBChttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-05/uoe-sn050616.phphttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/283440938_A_sonic_net_excludes_birds_from_an_airfield_implications_for_reducing_bird_strike_and_crop_losseshttp://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2014/sonic-nets-a-safe,-humane-way-to-shoo-hungry-birds123.phphttp://jpswad.people.wm.edu/Mahjoub%20et%20al%202015.pdfhttp://www.wm.edu/research/ideation/science-and-technology/sonic-nets123.phphttp://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24751208***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>High-tech pods to hide U.S. naval drones deep underwater</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It won’t be long before the Pentagon will be able to launch surprise attacks on America’s enemies from deep beneath the sea.Fox reports that DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is developing a defense technology using special pods that hibernate on the ocean floor until they are deployed.The pods, called “Upward Falling Payloads,” or UFPs, are 15 feet high and weigh 5,000 pounds. They contain state-of-the-art military technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles that can be used for monitoring and surveillance or weapon systems to be deployed as a form of defense.The military can pre-position the pods throughout the world’s oceans, lying dormant until they are activated in weeks, months or years.The UFPs can be activated remotely from anywhere in the world. Once deployed, the UFP riser rapidly floats to the surface with the help of a collar made with buoyant material. It then deploys on the surface, releasing whatever drone or weapon is contained inside.According to its website, DARPA is currently building and sea-testing the system’s riser and communication components. It will conduct sea demonstrations during the next phase.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Upward Falling Payloads (UFPs) on the ocean floor2. Drones or weapon systems inside UFPs3.

      <title>How Zika damages the brain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThree new experiments studying how Zika affects a developing fetus could provide proof of a causal link between the outbreak in Brazil and the spate of birth defects in babies that followed.The Los Angeles Times reports that the mosquito-borne Zika virus has been linked to a severe birth defect in babies called microcephaly, characterized by an abnormally small head.Thus far, most research on the virus has focused on the damage it inflicts on newborns. Now, scientists are using mice to better understand how exactly Zika damages the brain.A Washington State University research team found that the virus, when injected into pregnant mice, preferentially target the placenta, damaging it and using it to leak into the fetus.Another study found that Zika virus cells tend to be attracted to cells in the brain. Once they’ve crossed the placenta, they travel to the brain and infect neural progenitor cells, responsible for building a significant portion of the brain. The virus turns these healthy cells into viral factories that keep producing the virus until they explode and in turn infect other cells. The lack of neural progenitor cells means the brain does not fully develop, according to NPR.When the virus was directly injected into the brains of growing mice embryo, scientists discovered that they developed structural abnormalities in three to five days. The abnormalities were similar to those seen in babies with microcephaly.The BBC reports that the findings from the three published studies are significant but not conclusive, since tests were done on mice and not on pregnant humans. Scientists believe further research, as well as testing on larger animals such as monkeys  which are more similar to humans  may be more helpful.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe developers of a solar-powered computer hope it can change the lives of millions in developing countries.Marco Attisani, founder of the company behind the Watly computer, said the machine’s Italian and Spanish creators aim to provide clean water, electricity and connectivity, CNN reported.Trials have already taken place in sub-Saharan Africa, where millions live without electricity and clean water. A prototype Watly machine has been tested in rural Ghana, and developers plan more trials in Nigeria and Sudan, according to CNN.The final design of the 40-meter high, 15-ton Watly machine will be presented to investors and customers in July, according to CNN.The machine harnesses the energy of the sun through photovoltaic solar panels, which power a 140 kilowatt-hour internal battery. The battery then provides energy for a graphene-based water treatment system, developed by Watly, CNN reported.The Watly can supply 5,000 liters of safe drinking water per day, and can provide wireless internet connectivity within a radius of 800 meters, according to CNN. Electricity created by the battery can also be used to charge electronic devices.The number of those living without electricity stands at around 625 million in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 300 million people lack access to clean drinking water, according to the United Nations.Watly’s founder Attisani said the machine will have a lifespan of 15 years, according to CNN.Its creators hope it can have a huge social and economic impact, especially in Africa, by bringing clean water and energy to millions of the world’s poorest people.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

According to a report compiled for the U.S. Congress, China has undertaken large-scale land reclamation in the area since 2013, creating seven artificial islands in two years.The Wall Street Journal reports that on Tuesday, missile destroyer USS William P. Lawrence traveled within 12 nautical miles of Chinese-occupied Fiery Cross Reef.Fiery Cross is a 700-acre man-made island with a 10,000-foot military runway, deepwater port, and other military facilities. Given its extensive infrastructure, it is presumed to be the future hub of Chinese military operations in the South China Sea.The U.S. has said the operation was conducted to exercise freedom of navigation rights in the area, which are reportedly being restricted by excessive claims in the region. Fiery Cross Reef is claimed by China, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. Except for the Philippines, the rest of the claimants all require prior notice for transit rights within the 12-mile zone, according to the New York Times.China responded to the U.S. destroyer’s passage by mobilizing two fighter jets and three warships to shadow the vessel, reports Reuters.The demonstration comes ahead of a United Nations ruling on whether Beijing has maritime rights around reefs and atolls in the South China Sea.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twNASA’s Kepler mission, launched in 2009 and with two more years to go, has detected 1,284 new exoplanets, including nine worlds that may be able to sustain life.NASA announced on Tuesday that the Kepler Space Telescope, which searches for planets in our Milky Way that lie up to 3,000 light years from Earth, has verified 1,284 new planets. Five hundred and fifty appear to be rocky based on their size. Of these 550, nine are located just far enough from their suns to suggest they may contain water.The latest finding nearly doubles the number of confirmed exoplanets and is the largest number of new planets announced at one time, reported Space. According to NASA’s statement, the new findings can be credited to a computer simulation and a new statistical method that takes into account such factors as how many total stars are in our galaxy. The total number of exoplanets discovered now stands at 3,200. A total of 21 of these may be habitable. The Kepler mission shows that with at least 70 billion stars in our galaxy, there may be billions of habitable, Earth-sized planets out there that have yet to be discovered.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Rising seas submerge five Pacific islands, researchers find</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA new study led by University of Queensland researchers says that changes in global climate and the subsequent sea level rise has already led to the loss of multiple Pacific islands.The team of Australian scientists, after sifting through decades worth of historical insight from locals as well as time series aerial and satellite imagery, say that Isabel, one of the main islands of the Solomon archipelago, has already lost five of its reef islands. These islands were once densely vegetated but weren’t populated, reported the Washington Post. However, another six islands on Isabel have declined in area by more than 20 percent between 1947 and 2014. Meanwhile, residents of the island of Nuatambu have been forced to relocate to the nearby main island of Choiseul because of flooding. Of the dozens of homes that once stood on Nuatambu, at least 11 have already been swept away by the rising waters. One town on the Solomon Islands’ Taro Island began planning to relocate all of its residents in 2014 because the sea level rise threatens to swallow the land. According to the study, while the global average rate of sea level rise has been 3.2 millimeters per year since 1993, the Solomon Islands have experienced an average rise by about 7 to 10 millimeters per year since 1994.  The research team, who published their study in the journal Environmental Research Letters on Friday, discovered that the sea level rise has destroyed villages that have existed since the 1930s, and has displaced numerous communities.

      <title>New technology turns your skin into smartwatch touchscreen</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA team of scientists have developed a new technology that can make the skin on your arm and hand act like a touchpad for a smartwatch.The technology, known as the Skintrack, was developed by the Futures Interfaces Group, a research lab at Carnegie Mellon University.It requires the user to wear a ring and a sensor that is attached to the smartwatch strap. The sensor have four electrodes, which are used to receive the high-frequency electrical signals emitted by the ring when the finger touches the skin, in order to calculate the exact position of the finger.The technology allows the user to swipe and tap his or her arm to interact with the smartwatch, and even allows the user to paint a picture on the arm. The technology also goes beyond the limitations of a small smartphone screen by allowing the user to drag the apps off the watch and place them on the entire arm. Skintrack includes hot key commands, allowing the user to simply write an ‘S’ on the arm to silence an incoming call.According to the Verge, there are no concrete commercial plan for the technology. The team is working on how to supply constant power to the ring and to keep a steady signal when the body is in constant motion.

      <title>Mercury poised for rare transit across the sun&#x2019;s face</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twOur solar system’s smallest planet will be visible on Monday, May 9 as it passes between Earth and the sun, in a rare spectacle that only occurs a few times a century.Mercury will take about seven and a half hours to move across the sun beginning from 7:12 a.m. EST until around 2:42 p.m. EST. Mercury, which is about three times smaller than Earth, will be just 1/158 the width of the sun’s disk, so its movement across the sun is only visible with high-powered lenses.While the Earth takes 365 days to orbit the sun, Mercury takes only 88 days to make the journey. This means that Mercury passes between Earth and the sun three times a year, or about once every four months. However, as Mercury’s orbit is inclined seven degrees to the plane of Earth’s orbit, it’s rare for the three bodies to line up so that Mercury is in our direct line of sight to the sun, reported the News Tribune. In fact, this only occurs 13 to 14 times a century. According to the National Geographic, an interesting phenomenon that can be observed during Mercury’s transit across the sun is the black drop effect, which is an optical illusion that occurs when Mercury’s edge forms a teardrop shape as it touches the sun’s edge. Mercury’s flit across the sun will be visible through much of western Europe, northwestern Africa and the Americas, while other areas of the world may see part of the transit. The next time we’ll be able to view Mercury’s transit will be in 2019 and 2032.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Mercury and Earth orbiting around the sun; comparison of orbits2.

      <title>NASA unveils the giant, gold mirror of Hubble Space Telescope&#x2019;s successor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twEngineers recently revealed to the public the massive array of gold mirrors that will be the heart of the next generation space telescope. The James Webb Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope’s successor, will house the largest mirror ever to be sent to space when it launches in October 2018.Each of the hexagonal mirrors that make up the primary mirror on the Webb telescope is made from ultra-lightweight beryllium and coated in vaporized gold. Each mirror weighs roughly 46 pounds. According to Tech Times, the gold coating boosts the infrared light reflectivity of the primary mirror.The new telescope’s 6.5-metre-long diameter is made from 18 of these mirror segments. In comparison, the Hubble telescope’s primary mirror has a diameter of 2.4 metres. According to a statement released by NASA, the Hubble telescope is about the size of a school bus, whereas the Webb telescope’s size is comparable to a tennis court. The Webb telescope will go through many rigorous tests before its launch in a couple years to ensure that the telescope is ready for space. While the Hubble telescope currently orbits earth, the new telescope will sit at the Earth-Sun second Lagrange point 1.5 million kilometres away, and follow Earth’s movements around the sun. This distance shelters the Webb telescope from radiation and prevents it from being blinded by its own infrared light.According to NASA, scientists around the world will use this new telescope to capture images of the first galaxies that appeared in the universe over 13.5 billion years ago.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>UAE eyes man-made mountain to increase rainfall</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The United Arab Emirates is considering building an artificial mountain to increase rainfall and address the country’s water shortages.The International Business Times reports that according to the UAE’s Federal Water and Electricity Authority, an average resident uses an estimated 550 liters of water daily  almost two to three times the international average of 170 to 300 liters.The high consumption is especially problematic as water in the region is in very short supply due to the arid climate and naturally low precipitation rates.Arabian Business reports that the government has already turned to artificial weather modification. In 2015, $558,000 was spent on cloud-seeding. In February of the same year, the U.S.-based University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) received $400,000 in funding to produce a development plan for a man-made mountain.UCAR is in the early stages of the project. It is collaborating with the National Center of Meteorology and Seismology (NCMS) in a modelling study to evaluate the effects building a mountain would have on the weather, and what height, width and location would be best.Mountains force air to rise up into the atmosphere, where it cools and condenses into clouds. The clouds then produce rain or are seeded to stimulate precipitation.But cloud seeding can have undesirable outcomes, such as too much rainfall or none at all. Due to the rain shadow effect, an artificial mountain can inhibit rainfall on one side, causing that area to become more parched, according to Discovery.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Scientists create new contraceptive from seaweed without the hormonal effects of the pill</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twResearchers are developing sperm-binding beads that could be used as a form of contraception. According to The Scientist, the sticky balls are made from a sugary substance extracted from seaweed. They have a diameter of only 0.037 millimeters and are so tiny that around eight million can fit into the space of a small fingernail.The beads are coated with ZP2, a protein typically found covering human eggs. When embedded in the uterus, they act as a decoy  binding sperm to them and preventing fertilization of the real thing.The ZP2 beads were first tested in vitro and then implanted in female mice. New Scientist reports that despite being with a fertile male, the female avoided pregnancy for over two months, after which she became fertile again.The sperm-binding beads do not induce the side effects of hormonal contraceptives like the pill, which can include weight gain, lower sex drive and blood clots.While effective in mice, more tests are needed before the beads can safely be used as a method of birth control for humans.Conversely, the beads can be used in assisted conception, by identifying superior sperm that can successfully bind to the egg.The study  conducted by a team from the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  was recently published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA group of researchers believes temperatures in the Middle East and North Africa will rise dramatically over the course of the 21st century.Researchers of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia found even if Earth’s temperature were to increase by two degrees Celsius on average, the temperatures in summer in Middle East and North Africa will increase more than twofold.The temperature in those areas could rise to 46 degrees Celsius during daytime by mid-century, and it could be as high as 50 degrees Celsius at the end of the century, with heat waves occurring ten times more often than they do now. Also, these areas will experience 80 days of extreme hot weather per year by mid-century and up to 118 days by the end of the century comparing to just 16 days between 1986 to 2005.“Climate change will significantly worsen the living conditions in the Middle East and in North Africa.

      <title>Pentagon to test F-35 against A-10 in upcoming showdown</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will compete against the A-10 Thunderbolt II in missions including close air support, combat search and rescue in order to determine whether the new fighter jet can replace the aging warthog.“To me, comparison testing just makes common sense,” J. Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department's director of operational test and evaluation was quoted as saying by Stars and Stripes. “If you’re spending a lot of money to get improved capability, that’s the easiest way to demonstrate it is to do a rigorous comparison test.”The F-35, with a wingspan of 36 feet and the top speed of Mach 1.6, has a unit price of $98 million. It has been designated to replace the A-10, a four-decade-old warplane which only costs about a fifth of an F-35. The F-35 costs $67,500 per flight hour while the A-10 only costs $11,500.The F-35 allows pilots to share data immediately with others and is equipped with advanced stealth and radar-jamming capabilities. Its helmet also gives the pilot a 360-degree view of their surroundings. With its stealth features, the F-35 is designed to destroy its target from long distance instead of engaging in a close distance dogfight.The A-10 is designed for close air support, so it can fly at low speeds and altitudes. Its GAU-8 Avenger 30mm gatling gun fires depleted uranium bullets at 3,900 rounds per minute. Pilots in the A-10 are protected by a titanium compartment. The aircraft can survive direct hits and high explosives projectiles up to 23 mm.The A-10 is now deployed in Iraq and Syria in the war against the Islamic State. Despite its old age, members of Congress and troops believe the A-10 has unique capabilities in supporting ground forces.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Wingspan, speed and cost per unit for F-35 and A-102.

      <title>Newly discovered Earth-sized planets found orbiting dwarf star</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe search for life beyond our solar system has taken an exciting turn, after a Belgian-led team reported finding planets with the potential to host life.Fox News reports that a team of Belgian astronomers have discovered three new planets in the Aquarius constellation using the Trappist telescope at the La Silia Observatory in Chile.The planets are 40 light years away and similar in size and temperature to Earth. They orbit an ultracool dwarf star, named Trappist-1 after the telescope that discovered it. Trappist-1 is a dim, red star about a tenth the size of our Sun, and only slightly bigger than Jupiter. With a temperature of less than 2,700 Kelvin, it’s also only half as hot as our sun.All three planets could have liquid water on their surfaces and thus be potentially hospitable to life. The two closest planets complete an orbit in 1.5 and 2.4 Earth days, respectively. They receive two to four times more radiation than Earth, and may have areas that can sustain life. The third, with an orbital period ranging from four to 73 days, receives less radiation and may fall within the habitable zone, according to CTV News.Scientists are already studying the planets’ atmospheric conditions using NASA’s Spitzer Space telescope, with the Hubble Space Telescope joining in soon.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Ocean oxygen levels dropping due to climate change</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twResearch predicts that within 15 to 20 years, human-caused deoxygenation will be felt across the world’s oceans.A new study published in the American Geophysical Union’s journal found that oxygen levels in the world’s oceans are beginning to drop as a result of climate change.Higher temperatures mean surface water absorbs less oxygen. Such surface water also becomes more buoyant and less dense. As a result, oxygen is less likely to make it into deeper water.The resulting conditions are dangerous to marine ecosystems, which depend on oxygen for survival. Already, coral reefs and other sea creatures are suffering adverse effects from a warming atmosphere and an increase in carbon dioxide that makes waters acidic, according to National Geographic. With the threat already underway, changes in the southern Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific and Atlantic may be felt as early as 2030. Oceans in eastern Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia, however, won’t feel the impact until the next century.Scientists say carbon emissions must be reduced if we want to slow the oxygen loss, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. But monitoring and understanding where the oxygen levels are dipping, and how it’s impacting our waters, is also key.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Ocean oxygen levels dropping 2.

      <title>Despite global warming, Earth is getting greener, say scientists</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change by an international team of 32 authors argues that the huge increase in atmospheric CO2 since the Industrial Revolution has driven a huge growth in plants. American satellites have detected a greening of up to 50 percent of the Earth’s vegetated land over the past 33 years. Only four percent of the vegetated land has suffered losses. The new study, which was led by Chinese and American researchers, states that if the extra leaves that grew as a result of rising CO2 levels were laid out like a carpet, the leaves would cover the entirety of two continental USAs.According to the BBC, the scientists say that many factors are causing the vast increase in leaf cover, including more nitrogen in the environment and changes in land management. However, plants using the extra CO2 to fertilize their growth constitutes 70 percent of the plant boom we’re witnessing.The team of scientists involved in the recent research argues that at some point the plants will acclimatize to rising CO2 concentrations. Then, it will have no effect on them. Future plant growth is also limited by factors such as access to water and nutrients, which will likely be impacted by climate change.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Future plant growth limited by factors such as water and nutrient availabilityVOICEOVER (in English): “As global atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise, scientists say plants are using the extra CO2 to fertilize their growth.”“American satellites have detected a greening of up to 50 percent of the Earth’s vegetated land over the past 33 years. Only four percent of the vegetated land has suffered losses.”“The new study states that if the extra leaves that grew as a result of rising CO2 levels were laid out like a carpet, the leaves would cover the entirety of two continental USAs.”“However, the team of researchers argues that at some point the plants will acclimatize to rising CO2 concentrations. Then, it will have no effect on them.” “Future plant growth is also limited by factors like access to water and nutrients, which will likely be impacted by climate change.”SOURCES: BBC, Discovery, Science Dailyhttp://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36130346http://news.discovery.com/earth/global-warming/earth-gets-greener-as-globe-gets-hotter-160428.htmhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160426162610.htm***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>British eye surgeon to perform UK&#x2019;s first artificial cornea transplant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA British eye surgeon hopes to perform the country’s first artificial cornea transplant and initiate a UK trial of the procedure by early next year. Millions worldwide could benefit from the ground-breaking eye surgery procedure that’s able to correct blindness caused by malnutrition, disease or old age.Sheraz Daya, a medical director at the Centre for Sight in Surrey, England, hopes to treat up to 12 patients in his trial. According to Express, this new procedure is still pending approval from relevant UK ethics committees. Scientists have been able to create a synthetic cornea by growing human collagen in yeast. The collagen is then molded into the shape of a cornea, which is about the same shape as a contact lens.Damaged tissue from eye is then removed while the synthetic replacement is stitched in place of the old, damaged tissue. The patient’s cells and corneal nerves then grow into the implant, incorporating the transplant fully into the eye. A healthy cornea lets light into the back of the eye to the retina so that people can see. Damaged or scarred tissue on the cornea can cause blurred vision or loss of eyesight altogether. This new approach that Daya is advocating for, if successful, could restore vision to many in the UK without any need for actual cornea donors. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>&#x2018;Vocal fry&#x2019;: How it works and how it can be harmful</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twKim Kardashian, Katy Perry and your average millennial all adopt the same creaky, guttural voice, and apparently there’s a scientific term for it: vocal fry.When we speak, air is pushed from the lungs and through the windpipe. There, it passes through the vocal cords  two strips of tissue that control voice pitch and quality.Dr. Reena Gupta wrote on the Osborne Head and Neck Institute website that humans have three vocal registers: modal, falsetto, and fry. Modal is when we speak naturally. Falsetto is the register with the highest frequency. It involves the vocal folds being pulled tight with only the edges vibrating.The lowest of the registers is fry. It occurs when the vocal cartilages are squeezed tightly. The cords themselves remain loose and floppy, rattling against each other when air passes through, resulting in a creaky voice.In recent years, the fry has been a hot topic for debate. In an article published on the University of Virginia’s media relations unit website, otolaryngologist Dr. Jim Daneiro cautions that the amount of force used to produce the fry can potentially damage the vocal cords over time, leading to lesions, polyps or cysts.But from a linguistic point of view, there is not much cause for concern. A New York University article references Stanford linguist Penny Eckert, who surveyed 500 adults and found that while the over 40 bunch were bugged by the fry, those 39 and under weren’t. This suggests that culturally, there is nothing harmful about vocal fry. It may simply be language changing and adapting to fit the needs of the younger set.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. How the voice works2.

It is 125 meters long, 29 meters wide, and 23 meters tall.The ark weighs 2,500 tons. That’s the equivalent of about 15 blue whales, the largest animal ever known to have lived.The ark can hold up to 5,000 people, and organisers plan to attract visitors with virtual and augmented reality exhibits, according to USA Today.The ark will be lowered onto a barge, which will take it on the 6,000-mile journey across the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil.From Brazil, organisers plan to take the ark around South and Central America, before anchoring in the United States.This is the second replica ark which has been built by Huibers. The Dutch carpenter said he was inspired to build the boat by a dream that his home province was flooded, according to USA Today.Unlike the Biblical ark however, there’s no plan to load the boat with animals, whether two by two or otherwise.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Radiation still a concern 30 years after Chernobyl blast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThirty years after a botched experiment resulted in a catastrophic nuclear disaster, engineers are still working to contain the radiation.Reuters reports that on April 26, 1986, an explosion tore through a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Pripyat, Ukraine. It sent deadly clouds of atomic material into the air and is considered to be the world’s worst nuclear accident.Months after the blast, a concrete sarcophagus was built over Reactor 4 to contain the radioactive material inside. Years later, radiation is still present. A recent investigation carried out by the Associated Press showed that milk from nearby farms contained a radioactive isotope 10 times higher than the allowed limit.With the sarcophagus having since deteriorated, engineers are currently building a giant stainless steel arch more than 350 feet high and 500 feet long to replace it, according to the Wall Street Journal. Called the New Safe Confinement, the 36,000-ton structure will be wheeled in place upon its completion in 2017, effectively sealing the sarcophagus.Giant hover cranes in the arch will then disassemble and clean up the exploded reactor contained inside, reports National Geographic.More than 40 countries donated funding for the arch, which is expected to prevent further leaks for the next 100 years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Australian river bursts into flames near gas fracking site</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA river in Australia bubbling with methane gas has been filmed bursting into flames with a spark from a kitchen lighter.Video of the Condamine River set ablaze was posted online by Jeremy Buckingham, a Greens member of the South Wales Parliament, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.In a Facebook post on April 22, Buckingham blamed nearby fracking operations for the leak of methane into the river. There are several coal seam gas fracking mines in the area, and leaks were first reported in 2012, according to the ABC.Fracking miners drill a pipeline into the ground, which then curves horizontally and can be several miles long. Fracking fluid, which is made up of water, sand and toxic chemicals, is then pumped into the pipeline at high pressure.The pressure forces cracks to form in rocks along the pipeline, which the sand holds open. Natural gas then flows back up through the pipeline towards the fracking well.Critics, such as Buckingham, say high pressure from fracking causes more cracks to form in rock. Methane gas escapes from these cracks and moves towards the earth’s surface, creating flammable water and releasing toxic fumes.The flames on the Condamine River continued to burn for more than a hour, Buckingham said, according to the ABC. Writing on Facebook, Buckingham said “fugitive emissions could be a major contributor to climate change and make gas as dirty as burning coal.”Buckingham also called for a ban on fracking.“Fracking must be banned. Everywhere. No ifs, no buts, no exceptions. Ban it,” he wrote on Facebook.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Pipeline of fracking well drilled into the ground2. Fracking fluid pumped into the pipeline3.

      <title>Scientists discover 600-mile-long coral reef near mouth of the Amazon River</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twScientists never would have expected the Amazon River  surging with more runoff and sediment than any other river in the world  to hold an ecosystem as fragile as a coral reef. But an international team including scientists from the University of Georgia and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro found a huge 3,600-square-mile reef system just below the mouth of the Amazon’s muddy waters. In a study published in Science Advances last Friday, scientists describe how the 600-mile-long, newly discovered coral reef stretches from French Guinea to Maranhao State, Brazil. The reef types include carbonate structures, as well as sponges and rhodoliths, a type of algae that resemble coral.The coral reef was divided into three sections for the purpose of their study: the northern sector, the central sector and the southern sector. According to the study, each section receives different amounts sediment from the Amazon, and consequently receives differing amounts of sunlight. This causes their ecosystems to differ greatly. While the northern sector contains more sponges, the southern section contains a wider variety of fish and coral.The northern sector is unique in that chemosynthetic microbes help sustain a coral reef by processing minerals and compounds like ammonia and sulfur. Fabiano Thompson, an oceanographer at the University of Brazil, told Gizmodo that this is the first known reef to use chemosynthetic chemicals and minerals to sustain itself, rather than photosynthesis.The reef contains animals like lobsters and red snappers, but the biodiversity is rather limited, reported the National Geographic. Still, researchers recorded a total of 73 fish species in the Amazonian reef, the majority of which are carnivorous. Others survive on plankton or sponges. Researchers also recorded over 60 species of sponges. Scientists have said that this discovery is important because the Amazonian reef showcases how tropical reefs may respond to “suboptimal” conditions, something that many reefs worldwide are beginning to face in light of global warming.

Others survive on plankton or sponges.”SOURCES: Science Advances, National Geographic, CNN, NPR, Gizmodohttp://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/4/e1501252.fullhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/220416-Amazon-coral-reef-Brazil-ocean-river-fish/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/23/world/amazon-river-coral-reef-irpt/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/23/475414805/reef-larger-than-delaware-found-at-the-mouth-of-the-amazon-riverhttp://gizmodo.com/scientists-discover-enormous-reef-at-the-mouth-of-the-a-1772326348***For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Scientists create bacteria-powered solar panel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twResearchers at Binghamton University have come up with an interesting way to harness energy, using a resource we have far too much of  bacteria.Science Daily reports that to harness power from bacteria, scientists arranged nine bio-solar cells in a 3-by-3 pattern to form a scalable and stackable panel.The cells use cyanobacteria, which can be found in aquatic and terrestrial habitats, as a source of clean and sustainable energy.In the daytime, light energy absorbed by the panel causes oxygen and electrons to be released through photosynthetic reactions. When conditions are darker and no sunlight is available, the bacteria’s respiratory activities produce electrons.5.59 microwatts were generated in 12-hour day to night cycles over a total of 60 hours.Solar panels using a 6-by-10 configuration produce about 200 watts at a given moment. The bio-solar cells, in the same pattern, will only generate 0.00003726 watts.The technology is not the most efficient, but with further development, it has the potential to be a more reliable energy source. Once the panel becomes functional, it could power small, wireless systems in remote areas where frequent battery changes are impractical. The findings were reported in the paper "Biopower generation in a microfluidic bio-solar panel” which was published in the journal Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Selfie fever sparks huge rise in lip surgery</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA record number of lip surgeries were carried out in the U.S. last year as we all went selfie crazy.More than 27,000 lip augmentation surgeries were performed in the United States last year  a 48 percent increase since 2000  which the American Society of Plastic Surgeons attributes to the emergence of social media and the rise of the selfie, CNBC reported.Fuller, more youthful, or sensuous lips can be produced with surgical implants or the injection of a filler material, according to medical website WebMD.Using an injectable dermal filler is the most common method of lip augmentation these days, according to WebMD. One of the most popular fillers is a substance called hyaluronic acid, which occurs naturally in the human body.When our skin ages and loses its youthful moisture, wrinkles begin to form. However, hyaluronic acid retains moisture in the skin and can be used to shape, structure and add volume to lips.But the anti-aging effects of hyaluronic acid are only temporary. So after about six months or so, you’ll need more injections to keep those perfect selfie lips puckered up.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Plastic surgeon consulting with patient2.

      <title>New study suggests human limbs may have evolved from gills</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA new study is shedding new light on a widely refuted century-old theory that proposed a link between human limbs and fish gills.Science Daily reports that a research team from the University of Cambridge has found a possible evolutionary connection between our limbs and the gills of fish like sharks, rays and skate. The theory was first put forward in 1878 by German anatomist Karl Gegenbaur, but was dismissed due to a lack of fossil evidence.According to the study, which was published in the journal Development, cartilaginous fish have gill support structures called branchial rays, which fan out in the same way fingers do.The key is a gene dubbed ‘Sonic hedgehog.’ In humans, this gene determines where appendages like fingers will grow. It also keeps them growing to full size. The gene was named after the video game character by a researcher whose daughter was a fan of Sonic the blue hedgehog.When the scientists studied skate embryos, they found the same gene was responsible for the formation of branchial rays. When inhibited early in development, the gene causes the branchial rays to grow on the wrong side. When inhibited later on, branchial rays grow on the correct side, but are fewer in number, suggesting that the underlying mechanism for growth is the same as in humans. Despite the similarities, it’s possible gills and limbs evolved separately and simply used the same growth mechanism. They could also be completely unrelated, just happening to use the same gene. Further research is needed to find out for sure and prove the theory true.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Evolutionary connection between human limbs and fish gills2. Similarity between branchial rays and fingers3.

      <title>Smart mattress can tell if lovers are being unfaithful</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe Spanish designers of a new smart mattress, dubbed the “Smarttress,” claim their invention can tell you when your partner is being unfaithful. According to Re/code, the Smarttress bed’s “lover detection system” uses vibration sensors and contact zone detectors to tell if someone is on your bed when they’re not supposed to be. If the system detects activity, it notifies you via an app. The app displays the movement’s location and visualizes its intensity and per-minute impact.Engineer Ivan Miranda told the Daily Telegraph that the device can tell the difference between the activity of sexual intercourse, or, say, a dog jumping on the bed. “If it detects suspicious activity regarding time of use, frequency, intensity or speed, it sends a notification to the phone terminal with which it is linked," said Miranda.The device will cost around £1,200, the Telegraph reported. In a promotional video featured on the Smarttress website, Durmet, the company behind the Smarttress, say they designed the bed because of Spain’s high level of adultery.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

On appearance they live for up to four weeks and spend most of that time mating, reported CNN. While mating, the male clicks its abdomen and makes an acoustic sound to attract a female. The females respond by snapping their wings. After this, the female cicada lays hundreds of tiny eggs on tree limb, reported CNN.When these eggs hatch, the cicada nymphs fall from the tree and burrow into the ground.

      <title>Japan develops e-skin that can measure blood oxygen levels</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA research group from the University of Tokyo has developed an electronic skin that can be worn like a temporary tattoo. The group published their study in the journal Science Advances. In it, they describe the e-skin, which is composed of several layers of organic and inorganic material. At only 3 micrometers thick, it’s thinner than even some spider silks, reports the Washington Post. It’s also flexible and can withstand crumpling and distortion.A protective layer keeps out oxygen and water vapor, enabling the prototype to function for several days.According to Science Advances, the device can work as a pulse oximeter, measuring blood oxygen levels via polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED) that are laminated onto the finger. The diodes use green and red lights, along with a photodetector, as a sensor, with the results then appearing on the larger display. The team is working on ways to further the technology, which in the future can be used to monitor people’s health.Though with advancements like this that combine technology and biology, it can be used for more than just health and medicine.

      <title>What is the Pacific Ring of Fire?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twHundreds were killed and more injured when earthquakes hit Japan on Thursday and Saturday morning and Ecuador on Saturday night.Despite occurring only 32 hours apart, experts believe Saturday’s earthquakes are not related. The only commonality is that both are located in the seismically active Ring of Fire, reports Reuters.The Ring of Fire is a horseshoe-shaped arc around the Pacific Ocean that extends from South America all the way to New Zealand.At about 25,000 miles long, its most visible features are the volcanoes that dot the coast and make up roughly 75 percent of all active volcanoes on earth, according to National Geographic.Throughout history, cataclysmic eruptions have occurred in this area, as well as 90 percent of the world’s earthquakes. According to National Geographic, both are caused by the movement of tectonic plates  huge slabs of the earth’s crust.When plates slide horizontally past each other, some parts get stuck. Built-up stress in those areas eventually cause the rock to break or slip, and the plates to lurch forward, causing earthquakes.Plates that collide form convergent plate boundaries, which give rise to volcanoes through subduction.Those that pull apart form divergent boundaries, which become the site for seafloor spreading and rift valleys.A less-powerful quake in Tonga also occurred Sunday. It, too, is believed to be unrelated to those in Ecuador and Japan, reports SBS. Despite this, an increase in global seismic activity in recent years is still cause for concern.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twNew research suggests that the melting of the ice sheets is shifting the location of the Earth’s spin axis, meaning the North and South poles are moving.“If we lose mass from the Greenland ice sheet, we are essentially putting mass elsewhere. And as we redistribute the mass, the spin axis tends to find a new direction. And that’s what we mean by polar motion,” Surendra Adhikari, a researcher with Caltech and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who conducted the research with his colleague Erik Ivins, told the Washington Post.The Earth’s North and South poles are moving as the Earth due to the redistribution of mass on the planet, similar to the effect when a twirling skater extends or retracts arms or a leg. This is known as the conservation of angular momentum.The poles head towards where mass is being reduced. For example, if Greenland is the only region that is losing mass, then the North Pole will move towards it.Adhikari points out that in addition to the melting of Greenland and Antarctica, the changing pattern in water storage on the continents also affects the direction of the polar motion.He estimates that 40 percent of polar movement is affected by the loss of ice mass in Greenland, 25 percent is due to the loss of ice mass in Antarctica and 25 percent influenced by changes in water storage on the continents.Up until 2000, the North Pole was moving slowly toward Canada at a speed of around 8 cm per year. Now the North Pole is moving toward the U.K. and Europe at a speed of up to 18 cm per year.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Shifting on the Earth’s spin axis in terms of conservation of angular momentum 2.

      <title>Chip implant helps paralyzed man regain hand function</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA team from Ohio has made a medical breakthrough  successfully developing technology that allows brain signals to bypass a spinal injury and transmit straight to the muscles.The New York Times reports that when Ian Burkhart broke his neck five years ago, it damaged his spinal cord and left him paralyzed from the chest down. Though he retained some movement in his shoulders and biceps, he lost sensation in his hands and legs.To help him, doctors implanted a small chip the size of an eraser head into his motor cortex  the area of the brain that controls hand movements.After the surgery, Burkhart went through multiple sessions where he had to think about specific hand movements. The signals fired off by the neurons in his brain were then recorded by the chip and sent to a computer via a port on the back of his head.The signals are decoded, then transmitted to a receiving device studded with 130 electrodes. Burkhart wears the device around his arm like a cuff, allowing the electrodes to stimulate the muscles and make them move, according to Discovery.The system, called NeuroLife, has allowed Burkhart to make six different hand and wrist motions, and marks the first time a paralyzed man has been able to regain movement using recorded brain signals. It is not a cure for paralysis, however, since a patient can only make movements when connected to the system.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Damaged spinal cord leads to paralysis2.

      <title>Scientists plan to launch interstellar fleet of tiny laser propelled spacecraft</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA team of renowned scientists, Silicon Valley elites and a billionaire businessman have conceptualized a fleet of postage stamp-sized spacecraft for the purpose of interstellar exploration.According to the New York Times, the board of directors for the mission includes Russian billionaire and entrepreneur Yuri Milner, physicist Stephen Hawking and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. All technology  including the camera  for the tiny interstellar spacecraft would be placed inside a postage-stamp-sized chip, reported the Los Angeles Times. Called a “Starchip,” this device would come with a light sail to form a nanocraft. This sail has a surface that would use Earth-based laser light to propel it along, reported the New York Times.The laser light would come from a laser array potentially situated 13,000 feet above sea level in the Atacama Desert in South America, reported Wired citing Milner. Using light energy from the 100-gigawatt laser array, the team plans to send a fleet of these nanocraft to our closest star system, Alpha-Centauri.The proposed nanocraft could travel at 20 percent of the speed of light, or 134.2 million miles per hour, using laser light propulsion. At that speed, a nanocraft could traverse the 25 trillion miles to Alpha Centauri in a matter of decades, reported the Los Angeles times. while a current spacecraft would take thousands of years.Dubbed Breakthrough Starshot, Milner has invested around $100 million in the nanocraft concept. However, it will still potentially cost billions and could take up to 30 years to get a swarm of the devices into space if the concept is shown to be successful, reported Wired.RUNDOWN SHOWS:The chip and light sail to be used in the nanocraftPotential location and size of laser array conceptLaser light being directed at the nanocraftThe nanocraft being propelled by laser lightThe difference in speed between the nanocraft and current spacecraftVOICEOVER (in English): “All technology  including the camera  for the tiny interstellar spacecraft would be placed inside a postage-stamp-sized chip.”“Called a starchip, this device would come with a light sail to form a nanocraft.

      <title>Graphene solar panels could generate electricity from raindrops</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Scientists in China are producing solar panels that can produce energy from the last source you’d expect  rainwater.In a study published in the journal Angewandte Chemie, researchers in China introduced a new type of solar panel that adds a layer of graphene, or carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure, to dye-sensitized solar cells. A flexible layer of indium tin oxide and plastic is included underneath.Graphene has unusual properties that allow electrons to move freely throughout the entire layer. According to the researchers, rainwater contains positively charged ions like ammonium, calcium and sodium. When water binds to the panel’s surface, a double-layer of positive ions and negatively charged electrons is created, which ends up producing a voltage and current.Tests of the new solar panels have been able to produce hundreds of microvolts, which is small even compared to a standard AA battery, reports Quartz. The solar-to-electric energy conversion stood at about 7 percent, which is much lower than the 20 percent energy conversion achieved by the best solar panels on the market. So there’s a long way to go before the new solar panels become more widely used. But more efficient future versions could mean big things for the solar industry.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA review of Environmental Protection Agency records has found that lead levels in some New York water systems are over the legal limit.An Associated Press review found that 82 out of 2,800 public and private drinking water systems in New York state have had lead levels that exceeded the federal action limit at least once since 2013. These include 16 school or daycare systems that have their own water systems.According to the World Health Organization, when children are exposed to high levels of lead, it attacks the their brain and central nervous system. This can lead to convulsions, a coma or even death. Lower levels of exposure can also lead to developmental problems in the child’s brain, influencing everything from IQ to to behavior.High levels of lead exposure in pregnant women can lead to miscarriage and stillbirth among other things, the WHO notes.

      <title>Yeast infection causes first US uterus transplant to fail</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twDoctors revealed last Friday that the United States’ first attempt at a uterus transplant earlier this year failed due to a yeast infection.The first uterus transplant in the United States in late February involved removing the uterus, cervix and part of the vagina from an organ donor and moving the organs into 26-year-old Lindsey McFarland. The surgery took place at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. According to a statement released by Cleveland Clinic doctors, complications arose just two weeks after the surgery due to a yeast infection found in McFarland’s body. McFarland started to bleed heavily due to the infection and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors were then forced to remove the affected transplanted uterus.The infection was caused by a common species of yeast called Candida albicans, which usually resides alongside other microbes in the body without any side effects, reported the New York Times. Illnesses or a compromised immune system may cause the infection to spread though, and the medication McFarland was taking after the surgery may have allowed the yeast to spread in her organs.The infection ended up affecting McFarland’s arteries and prevented blood flow to her uterus. According to the New York Times, it had caused life-threatening damages to her blood vessels and clots in her arteries. Doctors say that McFarland, the mother of three adopted children, is now doing well after her surgery to remove the transplant.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Uterus removed from a woman’s body2.

      <title>New evidence links Zika virus to neurological disorders</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA link between the Zika virus and neurological disorders deepens as scientists discover microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome may be the most obvious diseases caused by the virus.After observing the virus replicating in brain tissues of aborted and stillborn fetuses, scientists suspect the Zika virus can act directly on nerve cells. They are also considering the possibility that the virus may attack nerve cells directly in adults.Brain and spinal cord infections such as meningitis, encephalitis and myelitis newly discovered in people exposed to Zika have all been caused by direct attacks on nerve cells.“What we're seeing are the consequences of this virus turning from the African strain to a pandemic strain,” Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine told Reuters.Meanwhile, more and more cases of microcephaly are being linked to Zika-exposed patients.Microcephaly has no known cure. Children with the condition are born with abnormally small brains and skulls, which in the most serious cases can cause the early death of the child, or even the death of the baby while he or she is still in the womb.Even if the babies survive, they will be intellectually and physically handicapped, or in the best cases suffer from psychomotor impairment.Another neurological disorder commonly linked with Zika virus is Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is when the body’s immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system by destroying the myelin sheath that surrounds the axons of peripheral nerves.The first symptoms of GBS include weakness or abnormal sensations in the legs, which gradually spread to the arms and upper body and eventually lead to breathing difficulties.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Researchers point to &#x2018;Ridiculously Resilient Ridge&#x2019; as cause for further California drought</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA new study by Stanford University, in collaboration with Northwestern University and Columbia University, published April 1 in “Science Advances,” says California should be prepared for continued drought conditions.Researchers focused on precipitation trends, tracking the atmospheric conditions for the wettest and driest and coldest and warmest years of the state’s typical winter seasons from 1948 to 2015.Researchers also point to what they call the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” as a strong cause of California’s drought.The ridge appeared in 2012 and received its nickname in December 2013 from Stanford University Ph.D. student Daniel Swain, who is also an author on the recently published study. At its greatest extent, the “RRR” stretched along the entire West Coast, from California north to Alaska. The ridge is created when warm air in the southern regions travel north while cold air in the northern regions travel south along the California coast. The persistent high pressure from the south along with the persistent low pressure from the north, push rain-bearing storms away from the state, creating conditions for California’s warmest and driest years.Furthermore, California’s reservoir systems, which relies on melting snowpack from the Sierra Nevadas, were not equipped for the changing weather. Prolonged drought wears the snowpack down, leaving less to melt each year. And warmer temperatures that often accompany severe drought have caused the snow to melt earlier in the spring.When a deluge does come, says Swain, much of it runs into the ocean instead of the reservoirs.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. California lakes shrinking due to drought conditions.2. Ideal rainfall and snow formation in Sierra Nevadas. 3. How a high-pressure ridge is formed.4. How a high-pressure ridge looks over California.5. How the high-pressure ridge affects California, including Sierra Nevada snowcap.6. How drought affects California reservoirs.VOICEOVER (in English): “A new study by Stanford University in collaboration with Northwestern University and Columbia University says California should be prepared for continued drought conditions.”“California’s water supply relies on ice melted from the Sierra Nevada snowpack. The melting snow provides a consistent trickle of water over the dry summer months, and wet winters build it back up again.”“However, a high-pressured ridge has caused warmer weather and a drier climate. A high-pressured ridge is created when cool air in the northern regions travel south, while warm air in the southern regions travel north.”“Along the California coast, the ridge creates a barrier, pushing rain-bearing storms away from the state. Researchers believe this barrier will prolong California’s drought conditions.”“A new study explains that this ridge is why the state has been experiencing warmer temperatures year after year. Researchers also say the ridge is causing the shrinking snowpack in the Sierra Nevadas.”“Furthermore, California’s reservoir systems are not equipped for the changing weather.

      <title>New details emerge about possible ninth planet far beyond Neptune</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twAlthough no one’s actually seen the planet that supposedly lurks in the outer solar system, planetary scientists at the California Institute of Technology presented evidence for Planet Nine’s existence in January. As a spacecraft orbiting Saturn recently returned with even more observations that support Planet Nine’s existence, evidence seems to be mounting that a mystery planet truly does dwell out there.Scientists first predicted the possibility of Planet Nine after noticing dwarf planets in our solar system’s Kuiper Belt had orbits that clustered toward the same direction, reported the Scientific American.This strange alignment is best explained by a sizable object, whose gravity tugs the dwarf planets into place. To achieve the observed gravitational effect, Planet Nine’s diameter is probably around four times the size of Earth’s, and its mass likely up to 10 times the Earth’s mass, reported Space.com. Its orbit is larger than the orbits of other celestial bodies that we’re more familiar with, completing a full orbit around the Sun every 20,000 years.Scientists speculate that the planet is probably an ice giant similar in composition to Neptune and Uranus.Planet Nine appears to be nearer than scientists originally thought. It could come to as close as 200 times the distance between Earth and the Sun, or 200 astronomical units. However, the distance could also reach upwards of 600 astronomical units. If the planet does prove to really exist, then we could reach it in as few as 20 years. Until then, the hunt continues for the evasive icy planet. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>SpaceX launching inflatable space habitat to the International Space Station</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The International Space Station crew is getting their first attachable, “expandable” room when an unmanned SpaceX spacecraft takes off on Friday afternoon from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s launch complex. When SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket launches from Florida on April 8, it’ll be sending the Dragon cargo capsule to the International Space Station with 7,000 pounds of supplies, reported CNN. A prototype expandable space habitat called the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, will be included in the cargo.The BEAM will be attached to one of the docking ports on the International Space Station for two years. According to Bigelow Aerospace, the Las Vegas-based company that manufactures the inflatable rooms, once the BEAM is attached to the space station, air stored inside will inflate the habitat to up to 13 feet long and a diameter of 10 feet.While the BEAM could fit one crew member comfortably, crew members won’t be living in the prototype yet. Instead, they will be running tests on its structural durability, as well as its ability to withstand variations in pressure, temperature and radiation.Made out of Kevlar-type material, the BEAM offers protection from outside space debris, such as small, asteroid-like objects.Inflatable habitats could be essential to future missions to deep space. On these long journeys, crew members will need more room to store supplies as well as conduct research. If the upcoming BEAM experiments prove successful, the prototype will lay the groundwork for future space habitats.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Panama Papers: How do offshore shell companies work?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twAn anonymous person from a Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca, has leaked millions of documents describing how some of the world’s richest hide money in offshore havens.Although the spotlight is currently on Panama, tax havens such as Panama exist all over the world. People use them to circumvent regulations that protect transparency, as well as to avoid paying taxes in their home countries. Shell companies are often established in cities and countries that have lax rules governing transparency and financial disclosure, or more lenient criminal laws. Using tax havens isn’t always about paying less taxes. Wealth isn’t necessarily kept within tax haven countries. Often such places only serve as addresses for shell companies, which exist solely on paper, and are created for as little as US$1,000, reported Vice in a 2014 article.On paper, these shell companies act as the intermediaries that own the wealth, whether that asset is a painting or a Swiss bank account. Because of the complex organizational structure of these shell companies, it’s very difficult to figure out who a company actually belongs to.Setting up a shell company is not illegal and its existence is not always for a nefarious reason. A shell company may be established as a way to for one to save up funds to open a business. It may also act as a front for a project that a well-known company wants to keep from the public’s eye until it’s ready. According to Vox, Apple for example, may have created a shell company called SixtyEight Research as a front for a car project. However, these shells are often used as tax or legal loopholes, as setting up a shell company doesn’t require much identification, which allows their ultimate owners to evade scrutiny.UC Berkeley economics professor Gabriel Zucman estimates that there is least US$7.6 trillion kept in offshore tax havens. However, due to the nature of tax havens, it’s difficult to know for sure what the true amount is.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Tax havens and their why they’re used for sites of shell companies2.

But with new technology, it might be possible to enjoy an unlimited amount of time in the shower, while still saving water.A system called Showerloop recycles shower water and sends it on a continuous loop  allowing longer showers with less waste.According to the Showerloop website, the system works by first collecting the used water and cleaning it through filtration. A screen removes hair and other objects, sand filters out particles, activated carbon removes smells and chemicals, and ultraviolet light kills bacteria.With the water already hot to begin with, very little heat energy is needed to maintain its temperature as it loops around.After the shower, the water can either go down the drain or be reused for other things like laundry or toilet-flushing.The whole design is available open source, allowing other people to build their own and improve on the system.

      <title>Solar-powered decontamination station offers safer surgeries in underdeveloped areas</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twResearchers at Rice University have created a mobile, solar-powered facility that can sterilize surgical instruments areas lacking the proper facilities.Called the Sterile Box, the station is built into a standard 20-foot steel shipping container complete with all the equipment necessary to prepare surgical instruments for safe reuse, including a water system for decontamination and a solar-powered autoclave for steam sterilization. Autoclaves, or pressure chambers, are standard in modern hospitals, but sorely needed in low-resource settings.In low-resource areas, a third of patients suffer surgical-site infections, a number nine times higher than in developed countries. These infection lengthen hospital stays and can lead to death. Most low-resource areas have inefficient systems, improperly maintained or malfunctioning equipment or no equipment at all, and unreliable power. The Sterile Box addresses all these problems.The station includes solar panels and electrical storage. It also has water distribution from two tanks: one on the ground that has a hand pump to move water to the second 50-gallon tank on the roof. Inside are two rooms: a main area and a foyer that separates the sterile processing area with a small window to pass instruments in and out.Processing is divided into four stations. At station one, technicians decontaminate instruments in a three-basin sink, removing debris and then soaking them in an enzymatic detergent and scrubbing with nylon brushes before a final rinse. At the second station, an electric hotplate heats the steam autoclave that sterilizes the instruments. At the third station, the instruments are dried on wire racks and then moved to the fourth station, a storage cabinet where they await the next surgery.The research team is currently looking at clinical testing for the Sterile Box.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Sun may produce devastating superflares that can wipe out Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA new study suggests that the Sun has the potential to produce superflares that could destroy the Earth.Researchers from Denmark’s Aarhus University investigated almost 100,000 stars with superflares and discovered that about 10 percent had a magnetic field similar to or weaker than that of the Sun’s. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.“We certainly did not expect to find superflare stars with magnetic fields as weak as the magnetic fields on the Sun. This opens the possibility that the Sun could generate a superflare,” Christoffer Karoff from Aarhus University told Live Mint.The study found that a superflare, just like standard solar flares, occurs when large magnetic fields on the surface of a star collapse. If one occurred on the Sun, the collapse would cause the Sun to release gigantic amounts of energy and hot plasma that would strike the Earth with an intensity of up to 100 times worse than the most powerful solar flare ever recorded.The superflare would not only severely disrupt GPS and radio communication systems and power grids. It could also wipe out Earth’s atmosphere and thus the planet’s ability to support life.The largest solar eruption in recorded history, dubbed the Carrington Event, struck the Earth in September of 1859. The solar flare disrupted the telegraph system worldwide and damaged the planet’s ozone layer.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The Sun’s magnetic field collapses2.

      <title>Navy tugboat USS Conestoga discovered after 95 years lost at sea</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twAfter nearly a century of trying to uncover the mysterious fate of the U.S.S. Conestoga and its crew, scientists can finally offer an explanation as to what happened.On March 25, 1921, the USS Conestoga set sail from Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, carrying 56 officers and crew members on board. Bound for Pearl Harbor, then Tutuila, American Samoa, it was intended to operate as a station ship. Unfortunately, it never made it to its destination.Weather logs indicate that at some point along its ill-fated journey, it met with a vicious storm, rough seas and dastardly winds likely damning the Navy tugboat and the men on board.In 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was conducting a hydrographic survey to measure the depths of the seafloor using multibeam sonar technology, when it discovered what appeared to be a shipwreck.An investigation followed in 2014 using remotely operated vehicles and robots. Roughly 185 feet below the water’s surface, scientists found a ship 170 feet long and 26 feet wide, complete with a steam engine, steering gear, and a naval gun to match those of the once-vanished Conestoga. Based on the location of the wreck, the Conestoga barely managed to travel just 24 miles after departing from California’s Golden Gate Strait, sinking within the first 24 hours of the expedition, roughly three miles from Southeast Farallon Island. While many questions have been answered, what became of the crew is still anyone’s guess. No traces of the sailors’ bodies were ever recovered.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. 56 men were on board the USS Conestoga2. Boat was en route to Tutuila, American Samoa near Hawaii when it vanished3.

      <title>MIT publishes study on traffic-light-free &#x2018;smart intersection&#x2019;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twResearchers at MIT have published a study outlining the basis for a potential traffic-light-free transportation design that, if developed, could allow twice as many cars to travel smoothly on the road.The study, based on mathematical modeling, examines a scenario in which high-tech vehicles use sensors to remain a safe distance from each other as they move through a four-way intersection. By removing wait time caused by traffic lights, these so-called Slot-based Intersections (SIs) speed up traffic flow.The theory is based on a “slower is faster” effect, when groups at slower rates have faster travel times. For example, a large group of people boarding a plane might cause a bottleneck effect, slowing down the process. However, a small group of people who aren’t rushing, and with each person keeping a distance from the other, is able to board much faster.MIT researchers are proposing a similar system, where smart cars with the technology to maintain their distance from other cars can travel faster through intersections. And cars that anticipate traffic ahead can adjust speeds ahead of time to avoid causing a bottleneck effect, and maneuver through intersections faster.Based on a model outlined by MIT researchers, there would be no use for traffic lights. Cars would enter intersections on slotting systems, adjusting their speeds accordingly. This allows the flow of traffic to continue, thereby decreasing travel time. The paper, “Revisiting street intersections using slot-based systems,” appears in the journal “PLOS One.”RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Heavy traffic at intersection2. People boarding plane create bottleneck3.

      <title>Leading climate scientist warns of superstorms and worse than expected sea level rises</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe possible effects of climate change are far worse, and could strike far sooner, than we previously thought, according to Dr. James Hansen, a leading climate change researcher who was among the first to warn the public about the serious effects of a buildup of carbon dioxide.The former director of NASA's Institute for Space Studies, along with 18 other leading climate scientists, published a paper this week predicting rapid sea level rises could happen within decades, according to a New York Times report.The researchers’ primary claim is that as the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica melt, a layer of cold, fresh water will build up over the ocean, trapping warmer, salty ocean water, with which it doesn't easily mix, underneath the surface. Thereby leading to a feedback loop that causes ice shelves to melt even more rapidly and slowing down and possibly even shutting down ocean circulation.The scientists believe that this ice melting will cool polar regions of the globe and warm areas around the equator, causing stark temperature variances that could make super storms, such as Hurricane Sandy, which struck the US East Coast with devastating effect in 2012, far more frequent, according to Inverse. To argue their case, the researchers controversially claim that storms during the warm Eemian period, 120,000 years ago, were powerful enough to lift massive boulders, 1,000 tonnes in size, from the bottom of the ocean and hurl them ashore.Dr. Hansen and his team believe a multi-meter sea level rise could occur before the end of the century and envelop all of the planet's coastal cities.Despite the dire predictions, Dr. Hansen, in an accompanying video explained that there may, possibly, still be an opportunity to reverse this worrying trend. "I doubt that we have passed the point of no return," he said, continuing, "but frankly, we are not certain of that." RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA new study suggests that the Moon’s lunar poles have shifted due to the geological activity beneath its crust.The study suggests that some 3.5 billion years ago, the moon’s internal volcanic activity melted a portion of its mantle, causing it to bubble up toward its surface. “This giant blob of hot mantle was lighter than cold mantle elsewhere. “This change in mass caused Procellarumand the whole moonto move,” Matt Siegler, Planetary scientist at Southern Methodist University, Dallas told Phys.org.The moon’s axis shifted 5.5 degrees, which is roughly 125 miles. It is roughly the distance from Washington D.C. to Philadelphia.The shifted axis has also caused the moon to lose much of its ice deposits, as they were exposed to the sun. Such discovery may also contribute to the research of where Earth’s water came from.“We don't know where the Earth's water came from. It appears to have come from the outer solar system well after the Earth and moon formed. Ice on other bodies, like the moon or Mercury, might give us a clue to its origin,” Siegler said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of the moon’s internal volcanic activity2.

      <title>Norway invests $923 million in futuristic bicycle highway</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twNorway has invested in the development of a network of highways for cyclists.The country has announced that it will spend 8 billion Norwegian Kroner (US$923 million) on 10 broad, two-lane, cross-country bike tracks in and near Norway’s nine largest cities. The highway will allow longer-distance cyclists to travel with a speed and safety hitherto impossible.The new paths will create bike commuter links between inner cities and outer suburbs. It will extend the protected cycle network out from urban cores through the commuter belt and into the countryside.The highway will not be tracks linking cities across hundreds of miles, at least not initially.In the absence of cars, the highway will allow cyclists to travel up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) per hour, making long-distance travel more realistic.The bike highway is part of the new National Transit Plan to clean up Norway’s transit pollution. According to the plan, by 2030, 75 percent of the country’s buses and 50 percent of its trucks must be low-emission, while 40 percent of its short-distance ships and ferries (an important means of transit in Norway) must be either low emission or use biofuels.If the bike highway succeeds, it should take pressure off roads and public transit and help cut Norway’s usage of fossil fuels.Norway’s vision doesn’t stand alone. In 2014, an elevated bike path was proposed for London by design firm Norman Foster. The futuristic cycle highway was designed as 220 km of car-free routes installed above London's suburban rail network and would accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour. And Netherlands famous suspended bike path, the Hovenring, conceived in 2008, has become a landmark. The cycle path roundabout in the province of North Brabant is the first of its kind in the world.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cyclists leave suburbs.2. Cyclists enter futuristic bike highway.3.

      <title>Pigeons with backpacks to track air pollution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA team of pigeons equipped with state-of-the-art technology designed to measure air pollution has taken flight in London.The Pigeon Air Patrol superbirds are each strapped with miniature backpacks housing 25-gram sensors to measure levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other volatile compounds in the air.The squadron is made up of ten pigeons. The program has been implemented to offer people on the ground the most up-to-date information on the city’s air quality. To access the readings, users need only tweet @PigeonAir. The pigeons then respond with current readings, with levels ranging from ‘moderate’ to ‘extreme’. This is the latest campaign to combat air pollution by technology company, Plume Labs. The French company is also planning to mobilize 100 Londoners to carry backpacks with sensors for on-the-ground pollution monitoring. Estimates indicate close to 9500 people die in London every year as a result of long-term exposure to air pollution. Around the world, the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution is nearly 7 million people, annually.Plume Labs has exceeded its crowdfunding goal of raising £10,000 to be able to fund plans for the live air map of London, with information generated by sensors on human patrollers.The Pigeon Air Patrol is only being employed for a 3-day test study, after which the birds will retire back to the care of their owner.

      <title>NFL acknowledges link between football and brain disease</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twThe NFL’s health and safety officer acknowledged on March 14 that there is a link between football and the devastating brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, also known as CTE.The admission was made by Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president for health and safety, during a roundtable discussion on concussions convened by the U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Energy and Commerce.Miller said the admission was made based on his assessment on the work of Ann McKee, a Boston University neuropathologist who had diagnosed CTE in 90 of 94 former NFL players. McKee leads the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank, a collaboration between the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University that studies post-mortem human brain and spinal cord tissue to better understand the effects of trauma on the human nervous system.“I unequivocally think there's a link between playing football and CTE," McKee told ESPN. "We've seen it in 90 out of 94 NFL players whose brains we've examined, we've found it in 45 out of 55 college players and six out of 26 high school players.”CTE is a progressive brain disease developed after a repeated hits to the head that shake the brain inside the skull. Repeated blows to the head cause the Tau protein, a protein used to hold together microtubules in a brain cell’s transport system, to modify and detach from the microtubules. Abnormal tangles of Tau proteins accumulate over time, ultimately killing brain cells.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of a head receiving repeated hits 2. Depiction of the brain being shaken3.

      <title>Gun that folds up to look like a smartphone can fire two rounds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA Minnesota startup has come up with the latest innovation in concealable weapons  a gun that looks like your run-of-the-mill mobile phone.According to CNN Money, entrepreneur Kirk Kjellberg developed the Ideal Conceal gun as a way to carry a weapon without bothering other people.Unlike other easily concealed guns like the folding revolver or the Taurus Curve  a gun shaped like a box with rounded edges  its main draw is that it doesn’t look like a gun when folded.A double barreled .380 caliber derringer, the Ideal Conceal is designed to resemble a smartphone. It transforms into a gun when the safety clicks open and releases the grip.The gun cannot be fired while in its locked position, making it safe to carry while clipped to the side or in a purse.The palm-sized pistol addresses the demand for easy-to-carry guns that can be accessed quickly for self-defense, according to the brand’s website.Already, Kjellberg has received thousands of emails from people who want to buy the weapon. It will sell for $395 when it goes on the market later this year.Not everyone is sold on the idea, though. CNN Money reports that law enforcement officials are concerned about a weapon disguised as something else and hidden in plain sight. And depending on state and local laws, Ideal Conceal carriers may still be required to have a concealed carry permit.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. People bothered by the sight of a gun2.

      <title>NASA&#x2019;s New Horizon mission reveals how unique and weird Pluto really is</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twPluto, the small, icy celestial body at the back of the solar system, was downgraded from a regular planet to a dwarf planet in 2006. It has been known as just that for years  the planet that never was. But NASA’s New Horizons mission, launched in the same year that Pluto was ripped of its planetary title, performed the first flyby study of Pluto and revealed that the dwarf planet’s surface is surprisingly complex and unique.Pluto’s surface differs from place to place. Areas are dominated by ice made from methane in some places, and nitrogen, carbon monoxide or water in others. The variation on its surface is unique “in the entirety of our outer solar system,” New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern told NBC News. A heart-shaped region on Pluto known informally as Tombaugh Regio is made up of ice containing mostly nitrogen. Within the “heart,” there’s a frozen plain scientists dubbed “Sputnik Planum,” a smooth, icy terrain made up of polygon-shaped hills divided by troughs. The flat landscape of the plains are interrupted by the towering peaks of two of Pluto’s ice volcanoes  the 2.5-mile-high Wright Mons and the nearby Piccard Mons. These volcanoes, and the fact that parts of Pluto’s surface contain many craters, suggest that the surface was once geologically active.Pluto also has an elongated, dark region along its equator called the Cthulhu Regio. It’s dark because the surface is covered by tholins, which is the byproduct of atmospheric nitrogen and methane interacting with ultraviolet light. These observations and many others made during the New Horizons mission were published online Thursday in the journal Science, shedding new light on the remote dwarf planet.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>United Airlines confirms 10-abreast seating on domestic routes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONENOTE: This animation is an update of an animation that was published on March 11, 2016.United Airlines plans to retrofit 19 of its Boeing 777 fleet to include 10-abreast seating in economy class on domestic routes.Most of the newly configured planes will serve routes to and from Hawaii, according to a USA Today report on March 9.United will rip out its current nine-seats in a row, 2-5-2 layout, to squeeze 10 passengers per row into a 3-4-3 configuration. That means the aisles in economy class will become narrower by around 3 inches each.The new layout will also mean a reduction in elbow room, as seat width decreases from around 18 inches to 17 inches.But legroom shouldn’t be affected. The only way that would be reduced is if United added extra rows of seats.Capacity on a typical United Airlines Boeing 777-200 flying domestic routes will increase by 20 passengers from 344 to 366, including 28 in business class and 336 in economy, USA Today reported.The airline expects to complete the retrofit by May next year, according to USA Today.International routes on United will retain a 9-abreast, 3-3-3 configuration in economy.But the move reflects a growing trend in aviation, with a 3-4-3 layout on 777s used on at least some jets by carriers including Emirates, Air France, American Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Air New Zealand and KLM, according to USA Today.More than half of the 777s sold by Boeing last year had 10-abreast seating in coach class, up from 30 per cent in 2008, USA Today reported, citing the U.S. manufacturer.Increased capacity can help airlines raise revenue, which they say keeps fares lower. Adding an extra seat per row is one of the less extreme ideas floated recently by airlines.More out-of-leftfield plans have included an Airbus patent for split-level seating and French manufacturer Zodiac’s idea to make passengers sit facing each other in a hexagon layout.Both Ryanair and Chinese budget carrier Spring Airlines have even said they would like to offer standing seats on passenger aircraft.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Getting tattoos may boost your immune system, says new study</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA study published by researchers from the University of Alabama in early March suggests that receiving multiple tattoos could strengthen a person’s immune system.In their study, the researchers found that although getting one tattoo may temporarily make a person weaker and more vulnerable to illnesses, getting additional tattoos may actually help a person fight off common infections. In order to conduct their study, researchers obtained saliva samples from customers at local tattoo parlors in Tuscaloosa and Leeds. From the samples, the researchers measured levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that suppresses immune response, and immunoglobulin A, an antibody that lines mucous membranes throughout our bodies. The study found that stress from a first tattoo experience caused increased levels of cortisol and a huge decrease in the amount of immunoglobulin A in the body. Lowered concentrations of antibodies results in a weaker immune system.But people with multiple tattoos only had a slight drop in immunoglobulin A post-tattoo. Researchers suggest this is due to a stronger immune response since the body had become habituated to that level of stress. Critics argue, however, that the study’s sample size of 29 people is too small to represent the larger population. Furthermore, researchers stressed that they aren’t recommending getting tattoos for the sake of immunity. In fact, the first tattoo can make a person temporarily weaker and more susceptible to disease.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Saliva samples taken from customers at tattoo parlors2.

      <title>Worst drought in 900 years may be behind Middle East instability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twA recent NASA study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research has attributed conflict in the Middle East, at least in part, to a series of droughts caused by man-made climate change.The current megadrought in the Levant region, which includes Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey, began in 1998. In recent years, locals have had to deal with water shortages, crop failures and record-breaking heat. To map out droughts in the region over time, researchers examined tree rings from both live and dead trees. Trees rings are like an ecological footprint. Thin rings mean a tree lived through a period of drought. The thinner the ring, the longer the drought. According to NASA, the scientists studied tree samples from countries bordering the Mediterranean including countries in the Levant, Greece, Spain and southern France.From the data gathered, scientists were able to form an idea of drought patterns in the region in recent years compared to historical records. In their study, they discovered that the current drought in the Levant is 10 to 20 percent drier than the worst drought of the past 900 years. The cause of the drought is likely anthropogenic, as scientists observed anomalies in the current tree ring data well outside of the bounds of natural variation.The drought has contributed to food insecurities and poverty in the region, and led to a mass exodus of refugees out of the Middle East and into Europe.Human conflict and environmental problems are often intertwined. Studies have shown that before the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011, the country had just experienced one of the most severe droughts in recorded history.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Total solar eclipse to sweep across Indonesia and Southeast Asia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nextanimation.com.twPeople across Indonesia will experience a total blackout tomorrow as the moon passes directly in front of the sun, a rare event that happens only twice a year.On the morning of March 9, a 100-mile-wide total solar eclipse will be visible to viewers in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. Viewers north and south of the 100-mile-wide area will be able to see varying amounts of a partial eclipse. According to the Guardian, in central Sumatra, the eclipse will happen almost immediately when the sun rises at about 6:30 a.m. local time. The eclipse will end near Hawaii at about 5:30 p.m. local time. The total eclipse is expected to last between 90 seconds and four minutes, depending on where the viewer is. It will last the longest in the Pacific Ocean, east of the Philippines.A solar eclipse like the one expected to occur on March 9 takes place only during a new moon, when the moon’s dark side faces the earth. As the moon passes between the earth and the sun, it casts a full shadow on some parts of the planet and a partial shadow on a wider region of the earth.New moons occur frequently  13 times a year to be exact. Yet we don’t see 13 solar eclipses each year because the moon’s orbit is tilted five degrees to the earth’s orbit around the sun. This means the moon is only perfectly aligned between the earth and the sun twice a year.The next visible solar eclipse will pass through the Western Hemisphere in August of 2017.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>China&#x2019;s expansion project in the South China Sea</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe South China Sea has been a source of much tension among countries with competing territorial claims to portions of the region, and China’s rapid expansion in recent years has only made things worse.According to the Washington Post, about a third of the world’s shipping lines pass through the South China Sea annually. The area is abundant with oil, natural gas, marine life and other resources  and no less than six countries are claiming land there as their own.Invoking geographical proximity, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim all or part of the disputed islands in the area.China claims the entire South China Sea as its territory. In 2014, its nine-dash line was updated to a 10-dash-line, now including Taiwan.According to a report compiled for the U.S. Congress, China began dredging in the South China Sea in 2013, moving sediment from the seafloor to submerged reefs to create artificial islands. By 2015, there were seven new islets: Mischief, Subi, Fiery Cross, Gaven, Hughs, Cuarteron, and Johnson South Reefs.Shortly afterwards, China built docks, lighthouses, bunkers, helipads, communication towers and other infrastructure on the islands.The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative reports that in September 2015, a three-kilometer runway was completed on Fiery Cross Reef, with three civilian test flights successfully landing by January. Airstrips are nearing completion at both Subi and Mischief Reefs.Radar facilities on the smaller islets  Cuarteron, Gaven, Hughs and Johnson South  allow China to monitor surface and air traffic more significantly. On Woody Island in the Paracels, Beijing recently deployed two batteries of HQ-9 surface to air missiles and fighter aircraft.The expansion has both environmental and political ramifications. In forming the new islands, marine ecosystems were damaged and possibly destroyed. According to the Guardian, they were either outright buried or killed by corrosive sand and sediment from the dredging process.Rapid militarization of the area also has tensions running high in the region. The United States, not recognizing China’s ownership of the islands, sent missile destroyers near the islands last year as a show of force.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Natural resources in the South China Sea2.

      <title>Trash can in India offers Wi-Fi in exchange for garbage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONEFor story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twTwo Mumbai entrepreneurs have created a trash can that offers Wi-Fi in exchange for garbage.The project came to fruition when Raj Desai and Pratik Agarwal, the 26-year-old co-founders of startup ThinkScream, attended the NH7 Weekender music festival in 2013. At the event, the pair noted connectivity issues when it took them hours to locate one another due to the lack of Internet connection. “Pratik and I got lost and it took us two hours to find each other,” Desai told CNN Money. “It struck us that we needed to come up with a solution for people to stay connected at these events.”They also noticed the immense amount of trash littering the festival grounds. Their solution was a 4-feet-tall plastic bin that offers 15 minutes of Wi-Fi in exchange for trash. The bin  which costs about $1,470  is equipped with an LED screen. When you throw something in it, the screen flashes a unique code to access 15 minutes of Wi-Fi, which works within a 164-feet radius.The project was funded by Agarwal and Desai, with support from Indian mobile operator MTS. The Wi-Fi trash can was tested at three festivals held in Delhi, Kolkata and Bangalore in 2014. While there are currently no smart bins deployed, with the exception of test models at events and colleges, Desai has been approached by private companies and government agencies to see how the bins can be deployed in large cities like Mumbai.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>How Google&#x2019;s driverless cars work</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA Google self-driving car finally was the cause of a crash on Valentine’s Day after traveling more than 1.3 million miles since 2009, reported Wired. No one was hurt and the damage was minimal, but the crash shows that companies developing the technology still have a ways to go before autonomous vehicles are actually commonplace. In mid-February, as it was driving on a three-lane road in Mountain View, California, a Google self-driving car trying to merge into the center lane hit a public bus. The car had expected the bus to yield. In a statement issued on Monday, Google says it “bears some responsibility” in last month’s crash, reported Reuters. In the same statement, Google says it has reviewed the crash and made some changes in their cars’ software to prevent similar incidents. Unlike human drivers who can react quickly to unexpected behavior or obstacles on the road, autonomous vehicles aren’t always able to do that yet. This is just one of the few important wrinkles Google and other tech companies testing autonomous vehicles need to smooth out. Another flaw with Google’s cars is that they require the roads they’re traveling on to be precisely mapped out, otherwise the vehicle is unsure of how to behave. These maps are extremely detailed digitizations of the physical world, where things like even the height of every single curb is measured out.Before February’s incident, Google reported that its driverless cars had only been involved in 17 accidents, all of which were caused by human error. What allows self-driving cars to be such “careful” drivers is the combination of GPS systems, cameras and various sensors that tell the cars where they’re going, how to get there and what’s around them at all times. The autonomous vehicles use GPS to match their position with customized Google maps. This allows the cars to select a starting point and an end point, as well as to choose the best routes to take. Radars in the front and back of the cars keep track of other vehicles on the road. The LIDAR sensor rotates 360 degrees and detects the distance between the autonomous vehicles and surrounding objects. A video camera behind the front windshield is able to read road signs and traffic lights.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Components of a Google self-driving car2. Car uses a GPS system to map its location3.

      <title>Beijing plans ventilation corridors to reduce air pollution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twChina’s capital city is planning ventilation corridors to tackle the country’s air pollution.Densely populated cities tend to generate more energy and waste heat. This results in a much warmer urban environment than in surrounding rural areas, according to National Geographic.Xinhua reports that Beijing saw its worst smog spell from November to December of 2015, blocking views across the city and prompting authorities to issue a red alert warning. Measures to curb pollution have led to air quality improving only marginally, with 186 days of ‘up to par’ air quality in 2015, up 14 days from 172 in 2014, Xinhua reported, citing data from the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection.To reduce smog, the capital is planning to build ventilation corridors. These are designed to relieve a city’s heat and pollution by improving urban wind flow.The corridors will be created by connecting parks, rivers, lakes, highways and small building blocks. Five primary corridors  over 500 meters wide   will run from the northern suburbs to the south. Secondary corridors, measuring more than 80 meters, are also planned. The corridors will reportedly allow northern winds to blow through Beijing during severe winter smog spells.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Urban areas absorb more heat and generate more pollutants2.

      <title>Cutting carbon emissions only way to save coral from ocean acidification</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA study published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature measured the growth of coral reefs in pre-industrial conditions  when carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were much lower. The study showed that the coral grew better in water that mimicked the conditions prior to the Industrial Revolution. Wednesday’s study led by scientist Ken Caldeira looked at a lagoon in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Scientists pumped sodium hydroxide, a base, into the water and brought the water’s alkalinity close to what it was in pre-industrial times. The team of researchers found that the coral grew seven percent faster in the less acidic water. Scientists have long known that coral’s growth rates worldwide have been slowing down but were unsure of what causes the slowdown. Many factors like warming oceans, pollution and overfishing are known to impact coral reefs. Last week’s study provides evidence that ocean acidification is mostly what’s to blame for the slowdown. The current chemical makeup of oceans has a pH level that facilitates coral growth. However, just as the chemistry of our skies has began to change, so has the chemistry in the water. Forty percent of the carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere is absorbed by oceans. Once in water, CO₂ forms an acid that has led to higher ocean acidity. As the ocean’s average pH drops, so has the ocean’s tendency to produce calcium carbonate skeletons. Protecting coral reefs from acidification is crucial.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAccording to a team of researchers from Duke University and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, slashing carbon emissions won’t just reduce global warming, it could also prevent tens of thousands of premature deaths by 2030.A 2-degree Celsius increase in atmospheric warming is usually considered the threshold at which the changes brought about by global warming  such as droughts and flooding  could exceed our ability to adapt. According to their research paper published in Nature earlier this week, researchers say that the two largest sources of pollutants responsible for climate change in the United States are the transportation and energy sectors. The carbon emissions attributed to climate change are not just bad for the environment, they also have negative consequences for human health.In their study, researchers modeled what would happen if emissions in both sectors were reduced enough by 2030 to put the U.S. on the path to stay under the 2-degree Celsius threshold.By 2030, under this “cleaner energy” scenario, as many as 175,000 premature deaths were prevented in the U.S., and another 22,000 deaths were prevented every following year. Under a “cleaner transportation” scenario, as many as 120,000 premature deaths were prevented, and another 14,000 deaths were prevented each following year.The nationwide health benefits of reducing carbon emissions would total around $250 billion a year  far exceeding the cost of implementing new policies.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Australian-made bionic spine to move robotic limbs using the power of thought</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThere may be new hope for people with spinal cord injuries, thanks to a device that is being hailed as the “holy grail” in bionics.Australian scientists are developing a bionic spine that could allow paralyzed patients to move using the power of thought.The device, a stent-electrode recording array or stentrode, is the size of a small paper clip. Details on the stent were outlined in an article published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. Bypassing the need for open brain surgery, the stent is instead inserted into the jugular vein using a catheter. It’s pushed up to a blood vessel in the brain, where it then expands.Electrodes on the stent record electrical activity from the motor cortex, which controls movement, and translate the electrical activity into commands. The commands are sent to a transmitter embedded just below the chest, which in turn sends them wirelessly to an exoskeleton or a wheelchair, allowing the patient to move.“It’s the holy grail for research in bionics,” said Terence O'Brien of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, a professor who is overseeing the project, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.Scientists tested the stent on sheep for 190 days, and are set to do human trials on three paraplegic patients next year.The project was three years in the making, and was partly funded by Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council, as well as by the U.S. Army, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>NASA&#x2019;s laser-powered spaceship could travel to Mars in 72 hours</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNASA scientist Philip Lubin is working on perfecting laser technology that could propel a light spacecraft to Mars in as little as three days.In order for spacecraft to achieve faster speeds, Lubin proposes using an electromagnetic propulsion system that uses light and radiation, rather than the current fuel-based rocket propulsion system. Photonic propulsion is a theoretical system that uses the energy and momentum from photons to move objects through space. According to Wired, when photons from a laser array reflect off an object, their energy is translated into a push that’s capable of moving objects like a spacecraft.The system would currently work best with robotic spacecraft. According to Lubin, a robotic probe with a thin reflective sail could travel to Mars in three days. On the other hand, a manned shuttle could reach Mars in a month using the laser-based system. He estimates that lasers could accelerate spacecraft to 30 percent the speed of light, which was previously unheard of. Using photonic propulsion, interstellar travel may be possible and sending a probe to Earth’s closest star, Alpha Centauri, could take as little as 15 years, reported Space.com. In comparison, our current technology takes four to eight months to get to Mars. It took 37 years for the Voyager 1 spacecraft to reach the edge of our solar system. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>How Donald Trump would build a wall along the Mexican border</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump boldly declared last summer that he would “build a great wall” along the border between the U.S. and Mexico, and that “nobody builds walls better than [him].” Months later, Trump continues to stand by these claims and insists that Mexico will pay for the wall’s construction.According to an engineer writing for the National Memo, for Donald Trump’s proposed border wall to be effective, it has to be at least 20 feet high above ground and stretch five feet below ground. Trump told MSNBC in early February he was envisioning something between 35 to 40 feet tall.In terms of building material, cinder blocks are readily accessible and they would make a sturdy wall. However, stacking each block one-by-one is labor intensive, reported the National Memo. Casting liquid concrete into formwork along the border is another option. But walls made this way are usually weak when they solidify in dry, hot environments.Lining up precast concrete panels and reinforcing them with steel is the most plausible option. According to the National Memo, more than 12 million cubic yards of concrete is needed to create Trump’s wall  over three times the amount used to build the Hoover Dam. By multiplying the wall’s price per square foot by the number of miles the wall would cover, Trump estimates that his wall will cost around $8 billion.His calculation does not include construction costs, the cost of building on different terrain as well as the cost of buying private land. CNBC calculated that factors like these could drive the price upwards of $15 billion.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Characteristics that Donald Trump’s planned border wall would need to have2.

Men who used their phones while charging, talked on them for more than an hour a day and those who slept with phones near their bedside also had significantly lower sperm counts.

      <title>How Uber conducts background checks on potential drivers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAfter an Uber driver killed six people in a shooting rampage in Michigan, attention has turned to how the ride-sharing app screens potential drivers.Jason Brian Dalton, who picked up and dropped off passengers during his shooting spree, killed six people and wounded two others during in Kalamazoo, Michigan on Saturday night.Uber bills itself as a safe ride, with prospective drivers needing to pass a background check to become part of the platform.According to Uber’s website, anyone applying to be an Uber driver must give detailed information such as their full name, birthdate and social security number. They also need to provide a copy of their driver’s license, auto insurance and vehicle registration.Uber then uses background investigation service Checkr to conduct a social security trace that identifies addresses associated with an applicant. These are cross-referenced with various national and state databases to check for offenses.When a criminal record is identified, the record is either pulled up digitally or reviewed in-person by someone from Checkr.Applicants are disqualified if they appear on any sex offender registry, are suspected terrorists or have had felony convictions.The ride-sharing app has been criticized by taxi unions for its lack of fingerprint scanning, something the company continues to resist.However, in the case of the Kalamazoo shooter, who had a clean record, it’s unclear how a more thorough background check could have prevented the violent attacks.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twOver the past two months, tens of thousands of Americans who hope to help blaze a trail to Mars and beyond submitted applications for NASA’s 2017 astronaut class. Between mid-December and mid-February, a record-breaking 18,300 applicants applied for eight to 14 spots in NASA’s astronaut candidate program this year. NASA received almost three times the number of applicants the space agency received during its last round of hiring in 2012, shattering the previous record of 8,000 applicants in 1978.NASA’s Astronaut Selection Board will review all of the applications and narrow them down before the top applicants are interviewed at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, reported Space.com. NASA will select final candidates based on their work experiences, teamwork and communication abilities, as well as particular personality traits.According NASA’s press release, accepted candidates will go through a two-year program where they’ll learn spacecraft systems, teamwork, the Russian language and vital skills  like spacewalking.Once they graduate, astronauts will be assigned to any of the four different spacecraft: the International Space Station, NASA’s Orion aircraft, the Boeing CST-100 Starliner or the SpaceX Crew Dragon.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Dubbed Virgin Space Ship Unity, the spacecraft is part of the company's SpaceShipTwo line and bears a striking resemblance to its predecessor.The VSS Unity replaces the Enterprise, which crashed in October 2014 in an accident that took the life of its test pilot.That incident, which happened after the ship's rotating tail section was unlocked too soon during the spacecraft's descent, was blamed on human error, according to a Reuters report.   While lacking major cosmetic changes, the new spacecraft includes key security features to prevent similar issues from happening.Once operational the spacecraft will be able to carry passengers up to 100 km above the planet, providing those willing to pay the necessary $250,000 for the ride, in addition to the view, with several minutes of weightlessness.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twMore than 9,000 residents in southwest China are expected to be displaced from their homes before the completion of the world’s largest radio telescope later this year.China’s state-run Xinhua news agency reports that the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, or FAST, is being built in China’s Guizhou province at a cost of 1.2 billion yuan (or about $184 million).The telescope has a diameter of 500 meters and is made up of 4,500 triangular panels, 4,350 of which are movable. A retina weighing 30 metric tons is suspended by cables 140 to 160 meters above the center, according to the state-owned China Daily.Once fully operational, the panels will reflect radio signals from distant parts of the universe towards the retina, where they will be collected.Some 9,110 residents who live within 5 kilometers of the telescope are expected to be relocated, with each receiving 12,000 yuan ($1,837) in compensation.Puerto Rico’s Arecibo Observatory, which measures 300 meters in diameter, is currently the largest telescope of its kind.

      <title>Why flights between New York City and London may soon get even longer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA recent study by researchers at the University of Reading says flights between New York and London could lengthen because of changes to meteorological conditions in the atmosphere that affect the jet stream.The study was published this week in the journal Environmental Research Letters and led by Dr. Paul Williams, an atmosphere scientist at the University of Reading.Researchers say that as the atmosphere warms up due to global warming, the jet stream will become 15 percent faster during winter time, reported Phys.org. The stronger jet stream will boost tailwinds, which may cause flights from New York to London to be shorter than the current five hours and twenty minutes. However, flights from London to New York are going against the jet stream. So trips may take more than seven hours, making the overall round trip longer.Flights are expected to take a total of 2,000 hours longer each year, which means higher fuel costs and more CO2 emissions. According to the study, the extra 2,000 hours each year could burn an extra 7.2 million gallons of jet fuel and emit an extra 70 million kilograms of CO2  equivalent to the annual CO2 output of 7,100 British households.Scientists say that since this jet stream circles the globe and because there’s another in the southern hemisphere, it’s possible that flights elsewhere in the world will be impacted by climate change.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Doctors find cancer treatment that teaches the human body how to kill cancer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twScientists in the U.S. and in Italy are developing a revolutionary cancer therapy that would teach the body to destroy cancer cells on its own, reducing the need for debilitating chemotherapy treatments. The new technique developed by the Cancer Research Center in Seattle, involves removing T-cells from patients, and genetically modify them by adding chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, from genetically engineered mice. The modified T-cells are then injected back into the patient’s body, and are able to target and destroy cancer cells. The therapy is similar to a treatment given  last year to British baby Layla Richards, who was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, a disease in which the bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes, Sky News reported. Richards received her treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital in central London and was left cancer-free.Recent T-cell immunotherapy trials have shown great results also in the U.S. More than 40 patients with different types of blood cancers were treated, and more than half of them were left cancer-free. Among patients with terminal leukemia, 94 percent went into remission. Being in remission, however, still implies the cancer could eventually return.In a second major breakthrough in Italy, researchers at the University of Milan have discovered that memory T-cells can stay in the body for at least 14 years, according to a study published on the San Raffaele Hospital website.This means the cells could be trained to fight cancer as well as to remember the disease in case it comes back, allowing them to defeat it again. The latest discovery gives hope for the development of a vaccine-style drug that could stop cancer from coming back once it has been defeated. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

This may lead to infection, anemia and easy bleeding.”“Last year, doctors in London used a new gene-editing technology known as TALEN on Layla.”“The technology uses molecular tools that act like scissors to cut specific genes in order to make the T-cells from healthy donors behave in two specific ways.”“First, the cells are able to become invisible to a powerful leukemia drug that would normally kill them.”“Second, they are reprogrammed to target and fight against leukemia cells only.”“A similar treatment is being tested in Seattle. The new technique involves removing T-cells from patients, and genetically modify them by adding chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, from genetically engineered mice, which are able to target cancer.”“The modified T-cells are then injected back into the patient’s body.” “In a second major breakthrough in Italy, researchers have discovere]]></description>

      <title>France planning to pave 1,000km of road with solar panels</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFrance has announced energy plans to pave 1,000 kilometers of road with solar panels.The country’s Energy Minister Segolene Royal said last month she expects tests to begin in the spring, according to Global Construction Review.The panels are made by Colas, a subsidiary of French industrial giant Bouygues, and took five years to develop. The 7-millimeter-thick Wattway solar panels contain photovoltaic cells, which collect solar energy through a thin layer of polycrystalline silicon.The panels will be glued to existing road surfaces and can withstand the passage of heavy goods vehicles, according to the manufacturers.Road surfaces are occupied by vehicles only around 10 per cent of the time, so the panels will get plenty of exposure to the sun, according to the Wattway by Colas official website.Some 4 meters of solarized road can power one household, and 1 kilometers can produce enough electricity for a town of 5,000 people, according to Colas.If it reaches its maximum potential, the plan could provide electricity for 5 million people, or about 8 percent of France’s population, Royal said, according to Global Construction Review.The cost of the project is unknown, but the French government has suggested it could pay for it by raising taxes on petrol, Global Construction Review reported.Last year, the world’s first road to convert sunlight into electricity opened on a 100-meter stretch of carriageway in the Netherlands.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Argentinian doctors suggest larvicide, not Zika virus, possible cause of microcephaly in Brazil</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul on Sunday announced that it had suspended the use of a larvicide used to control mosquitos that carry the Zika virus, after a group of Argentinian physicians posited a link between the chemical and the rise in cases of microcephaly in Brazil, Spanish news agency EFE reported.Doctors from the Argentina-based group, called Physicians in Crop-Sprayed Towns, are challenging the theory that the Zika virus is behind the microcephaly outbreak in Brazil. They question whether the birth defect may instead be caused by Pyriproxyfen, a chemical larvicide that has been injected in Brazil’s water supplies since 2014. According to a report by the Physicians in Crop-Sprayed Towns group, Pyriproxyfen was used in Brazil in a massive government-run program aimed at controlling the development of Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae in drinking water tanks. In the state of Pernambuco, for example, where the Brazilian Health Ministry has injected pyriproxyfen into reservoirs due to the proliferation of the mosquito, nearly 4,000 children have shown congenital malformations, “especially microcephaly,” the report said. Since October of 2015, Brazil has reported 4,180 cases of microcephaly. However, according to a report in the Washington Post, experts who scrutinized 732 of these cases found out that only 270 appeared to be linked to Zika. The rest were not microcephaly or were not linked to Zika.The Physicians in Crop-Sprayed Towns group noted in its report that in countries such as Colombia, where Zika is present, no cases of microcephaly linked to the virus have been reported.Sumitomo Chemicals, the company associated with Monsanto that produces the larvicide, which is sold as Sumilarv, wrote on its website that pyriproxyfen poses minimal risk to birds, fish and mammals.On Monday, Brazil’s federal government dismissed a link between Zika and Pyriproxyfen, according to a report in Britain’s Telegraph.“Unlike the relationship between the Zika virus and microcephaly, which has had its confirmation shown in tests that indicated the presence of the virus in samples of blood, tissue and amniotic fluid, the association between the use of pyriproxyfen and microcephaly has no scientific basis,” the government said in a statement. “It’s important to state that some localities that do not use pyriproxyfen also had reported cases of microcephaly.”RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Similar to the Freedom Room design project in Italy, inmates took the average three by four-metre-long cell and created a new type of living space for the incarcerated. The Freedom Room concept includes cabinets for personal items, as well as an enclosed bathroom to give prisoners some privacy.During the same workshop, inmates also proposed building waterfalls, computer labs and a healing center in prisons.A design idea called PriSchool incorporates an urban prison in Brooklyn, New York with a school of criminology, a pre-release center and a community center. The complex will merge areas of the prison, with facilities used by students at the school and members of the outside community.The concept of creating a simple living space for inmates that encourages rehabilitation follows the model used in countries such as Sweden and Norway.

      <title>How football helmets could be tweaked to help prevent concussions</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFootball faces harsh criticism as it’s become clear that a large number of football players suffer from the long-term effects of head traumas that originate on the field. While some argue that the rules of the game and football culture itself need to change, others are experimenting with modifying something relatively more simple: the helmet.The human brain is protected by a layer of fluid within the skull. However, that layer doesn’t provide enough protection during sudden, or forceful impacts. When the brain hits the inside of the skull, this causes a concussion. A standard football helmet has two layers: a hard outer shell and an inner layer of padding that’s usually made of foam. According to the Verge, the several inches of padding inside slows the acceleration of direct hits that occur on the field and weakens the force of an impact. However, several inches of foam is often not enough to combat strong hits. This is why some companies like ProTech and Guardian Caps have experimented with putting another layer of padding outside the helmet that can further weaken the force of a hard impact.Unfortunately adding extra padding doesn’t help against hits from the side that could rotate a player’s head, twisting the person’s brain stem. This damages the nerves there.A prototype helmet called Zero1 built by a startup in Seattle called Vicis has several layers of padding. A malleable but firm outer layer bends inward during direct hits. The layer underneath, which is made up of small columns, bends at an angle during rotational hits.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>NASA says asteroid could pass as close to 11,000 miles from Earth on March 5</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced on Tuesday that an asteroid could pass extremely close to Earth next month, much closer than the Moon.Asteroid 2013 TX68 will make its closest pass by Earth on March 5. The asteroid, which has a diameter of 100 feet (30 meters), could pass as far out as 9 million miles (14 million kilometers) or as close as 11,000 miles (17,000 kilometers). The average distance of the Moon from the Earth, by comparison, is 238,555 miles (384,400 kilometers), according to NASA.According to NASA, the variation in the distance depends on the trajectory of the asteroid, which scientists could not predict, since they were only able to track the asteroid for a few days after it was discovered on Oct. 6, 2013. What NASA scientists are sure about is that there is no chance the asteroid could hit the Earth this time, although there is a 1-in-250-million chance it could hit our planet on its next pass, on Sep. 28, 2017. Even if it does hit the Earth, it is too small to cause any real damage. It would likely break up in the atmosphere and blow apart in an explosion from an incoming asteroid called an “air burst.”RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Date on which the asteroid will pass closest to Earth 2.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twPopular British airline easyJet is set to trial a hydrogen fuel cell system on planes with the potential to save $35 million a year in energy costs, Reuters reported.According to CNN, the design could save company 50,000 tons of fuel each year, as well as reduce the airline’s carbon emissions. If successful, the concept could be used in easyJet’s current fleet with no new aircraft required.EasyJet’s head of engineering Ian Davies explained to CNN that they’re “banking on a three-to-five year proof of concept,” with a view to persuading manufacturers to adopt the technology in the next 15 years.Stored in the aircraft hold, the hydrogen fuel cells enable planes to travel around the runway without using any fuel, CNN reported. In a press release, the airline explained that while in taxi its aircraft currently consume 4 percent of their annual fuel. “EasyJet’s aircraft average 20 minutes of taxi time per flight – the equivalent of around four million miles a year – akin to travelling to the moon and back eight times, ” the airline’s press release stated.The company aims to reduce it carbon emissions 7 percent by 2020, CNN reported.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The company says that’s enough fuel for eight return trips to the moon.”“In a bid to reduce these carbon emissions and save money, the airline hopes to begin ground trials of a hydrogen fuel cell   to be stored in aircraft holds   later this year.”“In addition to the hydrogen, kinetic energy garnered from the wheels would help power the plane while in taxi. This is similar to technology used in Formula One cars.”“It’s expected that the concept could remove the need for tug vehicles to maneuver planes around the runway, giving pilots more control of the plane during taxi.”SOURCES: EasyJet, CNN, Engadget, Reutershttp://mediacentre.easyjet.com/stories/9658http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/02/aviation/easyjet-hybrid-plane-hydrogen-fuel-cell/index.htmlhttp://www.engadget.com/2016/02/02/easyjet-hydrogen-fuel-cell-concept/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-easyjet-costs-idUKKCN0VB00D***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>First Zika virus transmission in the U.S. reported, attributed to sex</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAn individual in Dallas, Texas has become the first person in the country to acquire the Zika virus disease while in the States, reported NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth. The disease has been quickly spreading through much of Latin America and the Caribbean.An American who traveled to Dallas from Venezuela reportedly transmitted the disease to his partner in Dallas through sex. Both individuals now have the disease, which has been linked to a massive increase in cases of microcephaly Brazil. Microcephaly is a condition linked to incomplete brain development in infants. Scientists have suspected that the virus can be transmitted sexually, as there have been case studies in the past suggesting that possibility. However, the New York Times reports that the cases are so few and far between that health experts generally believe there isn’t enough evidence to warrant a travel warning. The primary vector is still mosquitos. The first piece of evidence supporting the theory that the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted surfaced in 2008, after an American contracted the Zika virus in Senegal. After he returned home to Colorado, his wife was infected with the virus but their four children were not. The couple concluded that the disease was transmitted during sex. In 2013, French scientists also found viable Zika virus in a 44-year-old Tahitian man’s semen samples long after the virus disappeared from his blood.

      <title>Britain approves controversial genetic experiment</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twBritain's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has approved a study that may one day lead to designer babies, but that’s not the plan right now. Dr. Kathy Niakan, a molecular biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, will lead the experiment. The study will use fertilized eggs that are donated by couples, with the hopes of better understanding fertility problems. Researchers will use a new genome-editing procedure called CRISPR–Cas9 to turn genes on or off. This process uses specially programmed RNA to cut and remove snippets of faulty DNA to be replaced with healthy DNA. The embryos will be monitored over the course of 7 days as they grow from a single cell to about 250 cells. Critics say this could be the first step toward genetically modified humans.Dr. Niakan told The Guardian, “It is up to society to decide what is acceptable: science will merely inform what may be possible.” RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

It consisted of a single rack of servers and pressurized nitrogen, sealed inside a white steel capsule, with heat exchangers attached to the hull.Named the Leona Philpot, after a character in the Halo video game series, the vessel was submerged 30 feet into the Pacific Ocean, where the waters acted as a natural coolant.To better understand how to operate in an undersea environment, researchers measured pressure, humidity, motion and other conditions, successfully operating the self-contained data center for 105 days, between August and November of 2015, according to PC World.Project Natick’s next step is to build a new system three times as large, designed to be left underwater for five years at a time.With the project still in its early stages, no one can know for certain when Microsoft will be coming out with a viable product.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA British company Oxitec may have a way to fight Zika virus. They create genetically modified mosquitoes that produce offspring that will not survive into adulthood. The company uses a tetracycline repressible activator variant or tTAV which ties up the transcriptional machinery of cells, causing them to die before adulthood. Created in a lab, Oxitec mosquitoes are given a tetracycline antidote which allows for normal cell expression. These lab mosquitoes will survive into adulthood, whereupon the males will be released into the wild.The offspring of the lab mosquitoes will not possess the antidote and will therefore die before reaching adulthood, reducing the mosquito population and the spread of Zika virus.The modified mosquitoes are non-toxic to predators that eat them.

      <title>Microcephaly: What the rare birth defect linked to the Zika virus does to infants</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Pan American Health Organization, the World Health Organization’s Americas arm,  has warned that the Zika virus, which has been linked to a sudden rise of birth defects in Brazil, could see an “explosive” outbreak and spread to as many as four million people in the Americas, Reuters reported. Although a link between microcephaly and Zika is strongly suspected, a causal relationship has yet to be proven scientifically. There have been cases where pregnant women infected with Zika had children who did not develop microcephaly, AFP reported.Microcephaly has many potential causes, including infections, viruses, toxins or unknown genetic factors.Brazil health officials, however, after seeing a sudden increase of microcephaly cases coincide with the largest outbreak of Zika ever in the country, have suggested a link between the birth defect and the virus. According to the BBC, the number of babies born with suspected microcephaly since October in Brazil has reached nearly 4,000, compared to 150 in all of 2014.Microcephaly has no known cure. Children with the condition are born with an abnormally small brain and skull, which in the most serious cases can cause the early death of the child or even the death of the baby while he or she is still in the womb. Even if the babies survive, they will be intellectually and physically handicapped, or in the best cases suffer from psychomotor impairment, AFP reported.“There is no way to fix the problem,” Hannah M. Tully, a neurologist at Seattle Children’s Hospital, told the New York Times. “Just therapies to deal with the downstream consequences,” she said.In response to the outbreak, Brazil has warned women in affected areas not to get pregnant. Colombia and Jamaica have advised women to delay becoming pregnant for a few months. And El Salvador has asked women to avoid getting pregnant until 2018.The U.S. and other countries including Australia are advising pregnant women not to travel to regions where Zika is present.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Sonic booms, not earthquake, caused tremors in New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNew Jersey residents felt the ground shake as an F-35C and an F-18 conducted a routine flight test that sent sonic booms reverberating across the eastern seaboard.Fox 61 reports that on Thursday afternoon, a series of tremors were felt in parts of the northeastern United States, making people think they were experiencing multiple earthquakes.The real culprit was a supersonic flight test conducted by two fighter jets near the Patuxent River naval air base in Maryland that produced a series of sonic booms.CBS Philadelphia reports that according to a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, there were a total of nine booms recorded within 90 minutes, from 1:30 p.m. to 3 p.m.The USGS centered the booms over Hammonton, with the tremors felt from southern New Jersey to Long Island, and the sound heard as far as Connecticut.A Navy spokesperson said the supersonic test flights were conducted almost daily in the same area, but are rarely felt on land.The Press of Atlantic City reports that a temperature inversion may have caused the sonic boom to be felt over a greater distance. Normally, air is warmest near the ground and gets colder as it goes higher. But during a temperature inversion, warm air sits higher up in the sky, which could be the reason for sound waves traveled farther, as they move more readily through warm air.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Special electrical concrete can de-ice itself, says University of Nebraska engineer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twChris Tuan, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln engineering professor, has created a prototype concrete concoction that can conduct electricity and has the potential to make roads safer in a big way  by melting away falling snow.According to a University of Nebraska press release, conductive concrete is 80 percent typical concrete mixture, while steel shavings and carbon particles make up the remaining 20 percent. When the concrete is connected to a power source, the special mixture conducts electricity and generates heat as a byproduct.Tests show that the heat generated is strong enough to melt snow and ice.The energy required to heat up one square foot of concrete is just 22 percent of what’s needed to light a typical incandescent light bulb. Tuan told National Geographic that it doesn’t take much heat for the concrete to melt ice and snow. While normal concrete is just $120 per cubic yard, the price tag for conductive concrete is considerably greater at $300 per cubic yard, reports the Christian Science Monitor. However, Tuan says that the high upfront costs can offset greater maintenance and de-icing costs down the line.Tuan is currently testing the prototype mixture with the Federal Aviation Administration through March. If the tests are successful, the concrete will be tested at a major airport in the United States.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. What the conductive concrete is made up of2.

      <title>Zika virus outbreak likely to spread throughout the Americas: WHO</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Monday that mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to thousands of birth defects in Brazil, is likely to spread across the Americas with the exception of Canada and Chile, Reuters reported. The transmission of the Zika virus was first detected in Brazil in May 2015, and since then it has been spreading across many countries in the Americas. The virus is transmitted by the Aedes genus mosquito, which can also carry the dengue and chikungunya viruses. Zika causes a mild disease with fever, rash and joint pain, but it is rarely fatal and can be cured with bed rest and liquids.In Brazil however, health officials have also linked it to infant birth defects. According to the WHO, since October the country has reported almost 4,000 cases of microcephaly among infants, a condition that causes an abnormal smallness of the head associated with incomplete brain development.As a response to the outbreak, Brazil, together with Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Jamaica have recommended women to delay pregnancies, the BBC reported. Sao Paulo-based Butantan Institute is also planning to develop a vaccine for the disease. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) is also studying how to use its technology on Zika. According to Reuters, Zika transmission has not been reported in the United States yet. However, a woman who fell ill in Brazil delivered a baby affected by brain damage in Hawaii.The virus was first discovered in a monkey in the Zika forest, near lake Victoria in Uganda in 1947. It then spread to Southeast Asia and French Polynesia, until it reached Brazil in 2014. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Transmission of the Zika virus from Brazil to the Americas 2.

      <title>India plans to build satellite tracking station in Vietnam that can monitor China</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twIndian officials say their country plans to build a satellite tracking and imaging center in southern Vietnam, which would give Hanoi access to images of the region from Indian earth observation satellites, including China and the South China Sea, Reuters reported.The satellite tracking and data reception center will be established in Ho Chi Minh City to monitor Indian satellite launches. Indian media say it will cost about $23 million. The facility, however, will also be equipped to receive images from the 11 earth observation satellites India has in orbit. The Vietnamese will be able to directly access images from Indian satellites that cover the region. These will include images of China and the South China Sea, as well as images of Chinese naval bases, its coastguard and navy, and its new man-made islands in the disputed Spratly archipelago.The earth observation satellites images have civilian agricultural, scientific and environmental applications, but can also be used for military purposes.Collin Koh, a marine security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Reuters: “In military terms, this move could be quite significant. It looks like a win-win for both sides, filling significant holes for the Vietnamese and expanding the range for the Indians."India also has satellite-tracking stations in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, Brunei, Biak in eastern Indonesia and Mauritius.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Birth defect that causes intestines to protrude from a baby&#x2019;s abdomen on the rise in the U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twIncidents of a birth defect that causes a newborn’s intestines to protrude from the abdomen are on the rise in the United States, especially among African Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The condition, called gastroschisis, is a defect in the abdominal wall. When a baby is affected by gastroschisis, the intestines, and sometimes also organs such as the liver and stomach, stick out from the abdomen through a hole next to the belly button. The Los Angeles Times reports that from 1994 to 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have documented a 263 percent increase in gastroschisis among babies born to black mothers under the age of 20. About 2,000 babies are born with the birth defect every year. Health officials struggling to understand the cause. "This isn't new. I saw cases when I was a brand new trainee long ago,” James Greenberg, co-director of the Perinatal Institute and director of Neonatology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, told CBS News, “but they were really unusual then."Although the condition can be life-threatening, it can often be remedied by surgery in the weeks after the baby is born.Even after surgery, however, some infants can have problems eating and digesting food, because the organs have been irritated by exposure to amniotic fluid in the uterus, increasing the risk of problems such as stunted growth or malnutrition.Although researchers do not know what causes gastroschisis, they suspect that a mother’s diet, consumption of tobacco, alcohol and medicines, exposure to toxins and sexually transmitted diseases during pregnancy are all factors that could have an effect on the development of an abdominal wall defect, the Los Angeles Times reported.

      <title>Plastic in oceans will outweigh fish by 2050, Davos report says</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twBy 2050, plastic rubbish in the ocean will outweigh fish, according to a new report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation released at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.According to the report, the United States, Europe and Asia together account for 85 percent of plastics production, roughly split between the U.S. and Europe on one side and Asia on the other. The report found that 95 percent of plastic packaging is lost to the economy each year after a single use, at a cost of an estimated $80 billion to $120 billion.Only five percent of all plastic produced each year is recycled effectively, while around 40 percent is buried in landfills. About 32 percent  roughly 8 million tonnes  reaches the world’s oceans, the equivalent of dumping the contents of one garbage truck into the ocean each minute. As developing countries continue to grow and therefore consume more, the production of plastic, which currently stands at around 311 million tonnes a year, is expected to quadruple by 2050. This will bring the ratio of plastic to fish in the ocean, calculated according to weight, from 1:5 to more than 1:1. The report urges people to take action and to rethink the way we use and recycle plastic. It also suggests that manufactures help reduce plastic waste by producing not only plastic that is reusable but also compostable plastics, a new generation of plastics that are biodegradable through composting.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The experiment was carried out at Harbin Medical University in China, reported the New Scientist. The researchers reportedly connected the blood supply between the head and the new body, but did not connect the spinal cord.“The monkey fully survived the procedure without any neurological injury of whatever kind,”  New Scientist quoted Dr. Canavero as saying. The monkey was kept alive for only 20 hours following the procedure for ethical reasons.Other techniques to aid recovery could include spinal cord stimulation and the use of a negative pressure device to encourage the nerves to fuse, the New Scientist reported. According to the New Scientist, Dr. Canavero is seeking funds to perform a head transplant on 31-year-old Russian patient Valery Spriridonov, who suffers from a genetic muscle-wasting disease.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

We have two scoops on the front end of the car and a compressor that pushes oxygen in. The hydrogen and oxygen want to bind, but we force them through a micron thin layer of platinum. So, the electron can’t make that binding process, so it kind of goes around. We capture that as electricity, and then the hydrogen and the oxygen bind on the other side, which is H2O. All we’re left with is water vapor, that’s the byproduct. And, then the electricity of course runs the car.” Although driving a car that emits water vapor could be a bonus, Petschler said there are still a few hurdles ahead. “Getting the infrastructure into place, getting more pumps, that is our challenge,” Petschler said. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s website, there are only 14 public hydrogen-fueling stations in the United States, and 11 of them are in California. Petschler says Toyota is working towards a solution. Petschler said Toyota is working towards a solution. “We’re releasing our patents on the car and fuel cell stations. So, we have a company called First Element that’s helping us in California, Air Liquide in France.”   The Mirai accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in nine seconds, and it takes around five minutes to refuel.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Researchers discover evidence of Neptune-sized ninth planet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twResearchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have discovered evidence of a ninth planet beyond the orbit of Pluto.According to an article on Caltech’s website, Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown, discovered the existence of the planet that’s been called “Planet Nine” through mathematical modeling and computer simulations. While evidence shows the strong possibility of the new planet, researchers are still looking to make a visual observation. The discovery and observation of dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system have led researchers to believe that a larger hidden planet exists. The smaller bodies have orbits that appear to have been perturbed, or influenced by the gravity of a larger mass.The theory was originally set forth in a 2014 paper by Scott Sheppard of the Washington-based Carnegie Institution of Science and Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, which discussed the potential existence of a giant planet affecting the orbits of those dwarf worlds.Batygin and Brown set out to debunk the theory, but ended up only finding supporting facts.The planet is predicted to be 10 times the mass of Earth and to orbit about 20 times further from the sun than Neptune. It is estimated that it would take 10,000 to 20,000 years for Planet Nine to complete an orbit around the sun. Its size and gravitational dominance over smaller objects in its solar neighborhood, according to researchers, make it undoubtedly a planet, unlike Pluto which has been reclassified as a dwarf planet.The observations of Planet Nine is similar to that of the 19th century revelation of Neptune when researchers observed perturbations in Uranus’ orbit as a result of the larger neighboring planet. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Orbit of planets around system2. Orbit of planets and planet nine3. Uranus and Neptune4. Planets orbiting on one side of sun5. Telescope searching for planet nineVOICEOVER (in English): "While it takes Earth one year and Jupiter roughly 12 years to complete an orbit, it is estimated that Planet Nine takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to circle the sun.""The planet was discovered through observations of dwarf planets and small objects in the outer solar system.""In 1846, astronomers observed the orbit of Uranus and noticed discrepancies that suggested something was pulling on it. That force became realized as the planet Neptune.""Fast forward less than two centuries later, and researchers again noticed deviations in the orbit of objects and dwarf planets in the outer solar system. All of them seem to  orbit on one side of the sun.""A worldwide search is now in place for a visual of Planet Nine. Once a visual is made, it will officially be welcomed to our solar system as a full-fledged planet"SOURCES: California Institute of Technologyhttp://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-researchers-find-evidence-real-ninth-planet-49523***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Just 62 individuals have as much wealth as half of the world&#x2019;s population: Oxfam</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twJust 62 people have as much wealth as half the planet’s population, according to an Oxfam report, released as politicians and business leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos.And the wealth gap is getting bigger, Oxfam says. In 2009, the world’s richest one percent owned 44 percent of global wealth, and 2014 saw that figure rise to 48 percent. Oxfam has also calculated that as few as 62 individuals, 53 of them men, have the same wealth as 3.5 billion people, Reuters reported. The report comes as an urgent call to action, inviting governments to tackle this growing inequality.   “It is time for the global leaders of modern capitalism, in addition to our politicians, to work to change the system to make it more inclusive, more equitable and more sustainable,” said Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, chief executive officer of E.L. Rothschild and chairman of the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism, who was quoted by Oxfam.Among the measures to distribute global wealth more equally, Oxfam suggests clamping down on tax-dodging by corporations and rich individuals, investing in universal, free public services such as education and health care, and sharing the tax burden more fairly.

      <title>Zika virus case confirmed in Texas, woman infected during trip to El Salvador</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA woman who returned to the Houston area in Texas after a trip to El Salvador in November has a confirmed case of the Zika virus, Reuters reported, citing officials in Harris County. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, there have been 22 cases of the disease among returning U.S. travelers since 2007. Zika is transmitted by the Aedes genus of mosquito, which can also carry the dengue and chikungunya viruses. Zika causes a mild disease with fever, rash and joint pain. It is rarely fatal and can be cured with bed rest and liquids.An epidemic of the Zika virus in Brazil, however, has prompted health officials to investigate thousand of cases of microcephaly in the country. Since microcephaly is usually a rare condition, health officials have suggested a link between the virus and the disease that causes an abnormally small head size and incomplete brain development.According to the Wall Street Journal, Brazilian authorities estimate that 500,000 to 1.5 million people have been infected by the Zika virus in the country. In December, Puerto Rico confirmed its first locally acquired case of Zika virus, suggesting that the virus might be circulating there. U.S. officials say they are preparing for a growing number of Zika cases in the spring and summer, when the weather creates ideal breeding conditions for the mosquitoes that carry the virus.Outbreaks of the virus have also occurred in the past in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.

      <title>Thai-Italian woman searches for life-saving bone marrow donor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A young woman is now racing against time to find a stem cell donor after she was diagnosed with blood cancer in December. Her case has been severely complicated by the fact that she’s half Thai and half Italian. Twenty-four-year-old Lara Casalotti, a mixed-raced woman recently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, needs a stem cell donor with HLA markers that match hers, but as matching donors usually come from the same ethnic background, finding a match for her HLA genes has not been easy.For a stem cell transplant to be successful, there must be an HLA match. HLA are genes that encode for proteins found on all cells. The proteins act as markers that let the immune system know which cells belong to the body, and which don’t. In order to determine a match, doctors review eight types of markers: two A markers, two Bs, two Cs, two called DRB1 and sometimes two called DQ. An adult donor must match at least six of the markers.An individual inherits half of their HLA genes from their mother and the other half from their father. Therefore, siblings have a 25 percent chance of matching. Casalotti was told last week that her only brother is not a match.Now the family is launching a worldwide appeal for more donors from a minority ethnic or a mixed-race background to not only find a donor for Lara, but also to help other blood cancer patients from a minority ethnic background.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twWildlife officials nationwide have been putting out mechanical decoys to catch poachers  hunting illegally. The robotic animals have been effective at catching people and forcing them to think twice before they shoot. The decoys are made from taxidermied deer. The body is fitted with a radio-control system that moves the head, ears and tail independently.Wildlife officials set up the Robo-Deer by the side of the road and then wait nearby for someone to take the bait. A remote control is used to move the decoy deer and make it look more realistic.The Washington Post reports that two men in Maryland were recently caught in October after shining flashlights at a Robo-Deer and then shooting at it with crossbows. Officers found two crossbows, two flashlights, marijuana and a glass pipe in their car. Similar to other cases, charges filed against them included: having a loaded weapon in their car, shooting from the road, and shining a light at the deer. While all charges were dropped last Thursday, the Post reported, both men received a 30-day prison sentence.According to the Post, the Maryland Natural Resources Police owns not just mechanical deer, but also mechanical turkeys and bears as well. The mechanical animals are built to be shot and can withstand many “injuries,” so a single decoy can be used repeatedly. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>North Korea&#x2019;s hydrogen bomb test claim sparks scepticism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNorth Korea this week said it had successfully tested a miniaturized hydrogen bomb at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, but the claim has been met by international skepticism.There are four common techniques to monitor nuclear blasts, Reuters reported, citing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). One of which is seismic technology, which monitors geological activity such as earthquakes. Multiple seismic monitoring stations detected a 5.1 earthquake near the test location  the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. Other techniques include hydroacoustic monitoring which investigates underwater explosions, and infrasound monitoring which measures atmospheric nuclear blasts. A key verification technique is radionuclide monitoring which determines what particles and gases are left in the atmosphere.  According to Reuters, verifying Pyongyang’s most recent claim of a hydrogen bomb would require the presence of tritium and lithium.“If they find lithium, then it's definitely a hydrogen bomb test, but if it's only xenon ... then you're not going to know,” Reuters quoted Shin Kyung-min, a member of South Korea's parliamentary intelligence committee as saying.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Lyft&#x2019;s vision for an on-demand network of self-driving cars will mean fewer cars on the road</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twLyft, an American ride-hailing service, announced on Monday that General Motors has invested $500 million in the company, and the companies together plan to develop a network of autonomous vehicles.From the proposed plan, self-driving cars would reach American consumers through a ride-sharing service first rather than through individual ownership. According to a study by IHS Automotive, car ownership in the United States has crept to nearly 258 million vehicles as of 2015. Lyft and General Motors hope to change this through an on-demand network of self-driving cars. Forbes cites a Harvard Health Watch study that says the average American drives almost two hours a day. Even if self-driving cars takes up to half a day for maintenance and to recharge, that still gives users 12 hours a day to use one vehicle  enough time for six Americans to use the car. If six people can use one car, this means the 258 million vehicles on the road could potentially be reduced to around 43 million, or one-sixth of 258 million. The approximately 258 million vehicles registered in the United States are not all owned by different individuals. Some people own more than one car, which means the number of hours cars are left sitting idle is probably even greater.Reuters reports that the two companies haven’t set out a deadline for when the on-demand network would be available to consumers, but would immediately offer Lyft users short term rentals of GM cars.

      <title>Australia surfers quit jobs to create &#x2018;Seabin&#x2019; to clean up marinas and reduce ocean pollution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twTwo Australia surfers are gaining the attention from investors around the world for their invention of a device that helps clean the ocean, according to Australia’s ABC News.ABC News reports that Andrew Turton and Pete Ceglinski, who are best friends, became frustrated over the amount of trash that was floating in the ocean. They decided to quit their jobs to come up with a sustainable solution to the problem of ocean pollution, and invented the Seabin.The Seabin is an automated rubbish bin designed to be mounted on marina docks to help clean the water. According to the duo’s company website, the Seabin, which is built from recycled materials, is mounted to a dock and connected to water pump that is powered by an source on the shore.The pump pulls water through the Seabin, thus bringing all the floating rubbish and debris in the water into a natural fibre bag inside the device before water is pumped back out. The floating debris is captured inside the Seabin, and water flows out through the bottom of the bin and pulled up into the pump on the dock. There is also an option to  attach an oil and water separating device to the water pump to clean the water before it is returned to the ocean."It essentially works as a similar concept to a skimmer box from your pool filter. But it's designed on a scale to work and essentially attract all that rubbish within a location within a marine harbour," said Seabin spokesperson Richard Talmage, as quoted by ABC News.ABC News reports that the duo designed a prototype of the bin in Perth before taking it to market in Mallorca in Spain, a marina capital of Europe. A crowdfunding effort has already raised $50,000 for commercial production of the Seabin, and a video of the device has attracted more than 10 million hits online.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Astronomers believe giant comets &#x2018;centaurs&#x2019; might pose danger to life on Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAstronomers from Armagh Observatory and the University of Buckingham, writing in the journal Astronomy and Geophysics, say giant comets in our solar system could pose a bigger hazard to life on Earth than asteroids. NASA tracks around 12,992 near-Earth objects orbiting within our solar system. The agency estimates that around 1,607 of them are “potentially hazardous asteroids,” Tech Times reports.But a greater threat may be posed by giant comets called “centaurs,” balls of ice and dust about 50 to 100 kilometres wide and with unstable elliptical orbits that start beyond Neptune.According to the team of astronomers including professors Bill Napier, Duncan Steel, and Mark Bailey and Dr. David Asher, while orbiting, centaurs cross the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Occasionally, one will be deflected by the gravity fields of one of these planets and be pushed towards the Earth instead.If these comets get closer to the Earth, and therefore to the Sun, they begin to disintegrate. At that point their debris will, according to the astronomers, inevitably hit our planet. The disintegration of giant comets would produce intermittent debris bombardments lasting up to 100,000 years. “A centaur arrival carries the risk of injecting, into the atmosphere ... a mass of dust and smoke comparable to that assumed in nuclear winter studies,” the researchers wrote, referring to the climate effects provoked by firestorms that would be caused by a nuclear war.  The study notes that a comet’s disintegration and impact on Earth may have caused mass extinction events in the past, such as the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.The researchers also wrote that, based on growing scientific knowledge of near-Earth space, incidents of environmental upheaval and interruptions in the progress of ancient civilizations also suggest the arrival of a centaur 30,000 years ago.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

A previous attempt in June ended in failure when one of the company’s Falcon 9 rockets exploded after takeoff.  The 68.4-meter-tall upgraded Falcon 9 took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Monday with 11 Orbcomm satellites on board, the Guardian reported. Once in space, the booster separated from the Dragon capsule and deployed all of the satellites it was carrying. The satellites will provide machine-to-machine messaging services on the ground.The booster reached a distance of 200 kilometers above the Earth and stayed in space for about 10 minutes before heading back to a landing site about 9.65 kilometers south of its launch pad, the BBC reported. “Welcome back, baby!” Musk wrote on Twitter while on his way to the landing zone.A standard SpaceX rocket launch costs $61.2 million. According to Bloomberg, Musk estimated that landing rockets upright and making them reusable would cut costs by a hundredfold. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket2. Falcon 9 launch3.

      <title>ModiFace Live app allows users to virtually apply makeup in real time</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.tw Animation: Next Media AnimationVideo: Theresa Chong, Next Media Animation ModiFace Live is an augmented reality beauty app that uses face tracking and gesture tracking technology. The app allows users to virtually apply makeup in real time and record a video of their different looks. According to ModiFace Founder and CEO, Parham Aarabi, developing a makeup app was an accident. “The initial idea was for defense applications for lip reading,” says Aarabi. “Then, as a fun thing on the side, we decided to put this, a version of this, for changing your lips online. But, that became very popular and told us that there’s a lot of interest in something like this.” The newest ModiFace Live app automatically tracks a user's’ face because the system has already learned numerous facial features. According to Aarabi, over the past eight years, users had to upload their photos and manually define the shape of their eyes, eyebrows and lips by adjusting points on their photos. After one hundred million photos, the system learned how to recognize these facial patterns. The app also tracks gestures, such as a pouting lip or a raised eyebrow, because it compares facial movements relative to each other. Based on the gesture, the app suggests different makeup applications.   Someone with a critical eye may be wondering why users would even want an augmented reality app for applying makeup. “People have always been interested in trying different effects on their own photo,” says Aarabi. “The selfie phenomenon of applying different things on your image has been very popular. But, we believe it’s even more popular when it’s instant and easy to access, and when it relates to videos.” Aarabi says they’ll be launching a medical version of the ModiFace Live app in 2016.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twUrine could become an alternative energy source to fossil fuels, according to the inventors of socks which use waste fluid to create electricity. The wearable technology can generate enough electricity to power a wireless transmitter, researchers at the University of West England (UWE) said in a press release. Soft tubes placed under the heels of the footwear ensure that urine keeps being pumped while a person is walking. The pumped urine passes over microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which are energy generators located inside the footwear’s material support.The MFCs contain bacteria capable of eating the urine and breaking it down, producing electrons in the process.The electricity created is then able to power a wireless transmitter that sends a signal to a computer. The invention was inspired by the simple cardiovascular system of fish, the researchers said.The technology can use any organic waste to produce electricity, and could be an alternative to fossil fuels, according to the UWE press release.The invention also opens up the possibility to use waste to power portable and wearable devices, according to Ioannis Ieropoulos, from the Bristol BioEnergy Center at UWE.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Shape-shifting robots are designed for space exploration</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAnimation: Next Media AnimationVideo: Theresa Chong, Next Media AnimationResearchers at UC Berkeley are developing shape-shifting robots for space exploration. “It will be ridiculously inexpensive compared to the current rovers,” says Alice Agogino, a mechanical engineering professor at UC Berkeley. “We hope it will be more robust, will be faster, and will be able to handle more complicated terrains. Also known as a six-bar tensegrity structure, these spherical-shaped robots roll along surfaces by shifting their center of gravity. “They have either compressive elements that are rods, or they have elastic elements, which are kind of like rubber bands,” Agogino says. “And, they shift their shape by pulling on the elastic elements and making them longer or shorter allowing them to take on a range of different shapes and thus, change of gravity. One of the shape-shifting shapes that we’re interested in is for them to be flat. So that in storage, in a rover, or in a spacecraft, they can be flat and then they can spring open and then be launched.” Agogino says their target mission is either the moon or Titan, which one of Saturn’s moons. In addition to space exploration, researchers are also finding ways to use these robots on earth. “We’re also exploring applications where in fact the aircraft itself might be a tensegrity structure that can fly through the air, drop on the ground, and actually conduct some kind of search and rescue, or, delivery of emergency supplies,” Agogino explains.    Although the first robot prototype was built with Legos, the latest version has been upgraded with aluminum rods and 3-D printed parts. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Shape-shifting robots2.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twChinese oil company Sinopec is building a service station in the disputed Paracels Islands in the South China Sea, Reuters reported. The station, along with a storage tank, is being built on Woody Island and will be completed in one year. The facilities will provide fuel to all Chinese-controlled islands and reefs in the South China Sea over the next few years, Sinopec said in a post on its microblog. Woody Island has a population of about 1,000 people. China has also been expanding infrastructure on it by building a new airport facility and extending the runway.China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion worth of maritime trade passes every year. That claim is not recognized by the United States and its allies, which conduct freedom of navigation exercises in waters claimed by China.Other countries have claims in the South China Sea such as Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan. On November 25, the BBC recorded a Royal Australian Air Force P-3 Orion surveillance plane conducting one such patrol. The plane tried to inform the Chinese navy, which did not respond. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, by stepping up military surveillance flights over the region, Australia is showing China it does not intend to stop operations in the disputed areas.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe U.S. Navy’s largest and most expensive ever destroyer took to the Atlantic Ocean on Monday for its first test in open seas.The 600-foot-long, 15,000-ton USS Zumwalt took four years to build at a cost of $4.3 billion, the Portland Press Herald reports.The stealth warship’s wave-piercing “tumblehome” hull, oblique deckhouse and smooth or enclosed surfaces are designed to make it appear on radar as a small boat, such as a fishing vessel.The Zumwalt is about 100 feet longer and 20 feet wider than the U.S. Navy's current class of destroyers and has more advanced weapons, including a computer-guided missile system that can hit targets up to 63 miles away.Further tests are scheduled on even more sophisticated weaponry, including an electromagnetic rail gun that can launch projectiles at seven times the speed of sound at targets more than 100 miles away, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.The ship was designed to operate closer to land in support of ground attacks and also in the open seas in battles against other ships, aircraft or submarines.The Zumwalt, which can hit a top speed in excess of 30 knots (35 miles per hour), is powered by a 78-megawatt power plant and is the U.S. Navy’s first “all electric” warship. Its gas-turbine engines power generators, rather than propellers.Naval architects have raised questions about the stability of the tumblehome design in bad weather, but the U.S. Navy has said it is confident in the vessel’s seaworthiness, the Portland Press Herald reports.The ship is named after decorated Naval officer Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, who died in 2000.The U.S. Navy plans to build two more ships to complete the Zumwalt class.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>FDA approves device to stop bleeding from gunshot wounds in 15 seconds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the civilian use of the XSTAT Rapid Hemostasis System, which can stop the bleeding from an open gunshot wound in 15 seconds.The device had already been in use by the military after being approved for use in the battlefield in 2014.  William Maisel, M.D., M.P.H., acting director of the Office of Device Evaluation in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health said: “It is exciting to see this technology transition to help civilian first responders control some severe, life-threatening bleeding while on the trauma scene.”The XSTAT 30 is for use with patients who have life-threatening hemorrhagic shock, when emergency medical care cannot be found in minutes. The treatment uses a syringe-style applicator to puts tablet-sized cellulose sponges into the wound to absorb blood and stop the bleeding. Each XSTAT 30 syringe has 92 sponges that can absorb a pint of blood. The dressing is effective for up to four hours, while the patient seeks further medical attention. Up to three applicators can be used on an individual patient. The sponges have radioplaque markers so an X-ray can pick up any sponges to help in the process of extraction.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

If successful, the probe will have two years to observe Venus, according to The Japan Times.The Akatsuki space probe was launched in May of 2010, but the first attempt to place it in Venus’s orbit in December 2010 failed, because of a problem with the main engine, and it was redirected to the sun’s orbit, where it sustained high temperatures and radiation. Although the nozzle of the main engine is damaged, Akatsuki still has six kinds of observation equipment that will be used to study the atmospheric phenomenon called super-rotation, which occurs on Venus as the atmosphere rotates faster than the planet itself, The Japan times reported.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Uber tests color-coded lights to help riders find drivers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twUber, the ridesharing app company, has announced that it will began testing a color-coded system they’re calling “SPOT.”The idea was stemmed from the problem where riders sometimes get into the wrong vehicle or have difficulty finding the car they had requested. There’s also the issue of Uber scammers; drivers who pull up to a curb and allow people to enter their vehicle under the assumption it’s an Uber car. To help rectify these issues, Uber has announced Uber drivers in Seattle will have LED light strips placed inside the vehicle’s windshield. When a customer requests a Uber ride via the app, they will be asked to choose a color. If the customer picks green, the Uber driver will flash a green LED light on the windshield when he or she arrives at the pickup location, helping the passenger more quickly identify which vehicle is intended for them.Customer can also flash the same color on their phone and hold it up in a crowded area so that the driver and rider can connect more easily.Uber says SPOT Will help trim down wait times and provide a more “seamless” experience. The company did not specify when others cities may also began using the SPOT feature. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. A woman is seen searching for Uber ride 2. A woman gets into wrong vehicle3.

The woman uses her phone to show her chosen Uber color and is foundVOICEOVER (in English): “Ridesharing app Uber says it wants to reduce the time it takes for drivers and riders to find each other, eliminate the embarrassment of getting into the wrong vehicle, and stop Uber-imposter scammers.” “Starting December 2015, select Uber cars in Seattle will begin testing SPOT, a color-code idea that asks riders to select yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, or green.”“The responding Uber vehicle will then display the rider’s chosen color on LED light strips inside their windshield. If you picked green and you see green, that’s your ride.” “In dark or crowded situations, Uber app users can also display their chosen color on their phone and hold it up so that a driver can quickly identify their passenger. Uber has not announced if or when it will expand its SPOT color-code experiment to other areas.” SOURCES: Uber, Huffington Post, Newsy http://newsroom.uber.com/seattle/2015/12/enabling-seamless-pickups-through-color-coding/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uber-spot_565f35ffe4b072e9d1c459f6http://www.newsy.com/videos/uber-tests-colored-lights-to-help-customers-find-their-ride/***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Company aims to enhance predictive interface software for AR and VR applications</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twQuantum Interface, a software and design company in Austin Texas, is trying to develop a foundation for the way people interact with augmented reality and virtual reality devices. The company is developing predictive interface software, which allows users to search through menus on their devices by using one continuous motion. “This is going to be the greatest design revolution we’ve had since the days of the mouse,” says Jonathan Josephson, founder and chief technology officer of Quantum Interface. “Now, we can begin to put our content in a three-dimensional array in augmented reality and move once towards where we want to go, “ Josephson said. “That doesn’t exist now in our interfaces.” According to Josephson, the touch and touchless prototypes are based on three design principles. “The change of angle simultaneously selects and controls the attribute. It’s a continuous motion,” says Josephson. “Then we use it [where] we’re inside a sensor field. Wherever the user begins to interact, that becomes the point of origin. So, it’s a relative motion with changes of angle, speed and acceleration.” A vector is then drawn to help predict what the user wants to select.“This is the biggest change for designers,” Josephson said. “If they design differently they can use different interfaces that are much more natural.”According to Josephson, it has to do with the way our brain works. “We are actually using the fastest part of the brain and the part of the brain that can learn the easiest. So, when somebody tries out our interfaces, it takes about five seconds to learn instead of 20 seconds to learn. The button based system where I have to remember where those buttons are and then touch and release requires a higher cognitive load to recognize where those are.” QiLaunch Mobile for Android smartphones and tablets, and QiLaunch Wear for Android smartwatches is currently in private beta testing.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAfter a one-year hiatus, Japan is resuming its whale hunts in the Antarctic, again maintaining the slaughter is for “scientific research.” In 2014, the International Court of Justice said Japan’s claims for the justification of its whaling practices were not rooted in scientific research and should stop. Calls of outrage from the international community to halt the expedition have not deterred Japan, and as a result, 333 minke whales will be hunted down and slaughtered between now and March 2016. The number represents a reduced kill target compared to years past, down roughly two-thirds from previous hunts.Over the next 12 years, Japan plans to capture and slaughter 4000 whales for the stated purpose of building a body of research, its attempt to prove the whale population is large enough for commercial whaling to return.An international whaling moratorium took effect across the world beginning in the 1985/1986 season, but Japan has used the “scientific research” loophole to conduct its annual slaughter ever since.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>China launches sixth flight test of hypersonic glide vehicle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twBEIJING  China successfully conducted a flight test this week of its DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle, according to a report in the Washington Free Beacon.The hypersonic vehicle was launched atop a ballistic missile from the Wuzhai missile test center in Shanxi Province and glided to an impact range in western China, several thousand miles away. The test was tracked by U.S. intelligence agencies, according to the report, which cites unnamed defense officials.The DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle is believed to be highly maneuverable and capable of flying at speeds of between Mach 5, and Mach 10, or between five and 10 times the speed of sound.It is thought to be under development to carry both nuclear and non-nuclear payloads.Because of the DF-ZF’s speed and maneuverability, intercepting it would be difficult for current U.S. defenses, which rely on satellite and ground radar to track and intercept missiles that travel along a predictable flight path.Richard Fisher, senior fellow at the Virginia-based International Assessment and Strategy Center, told the Taipei Times that the vehicle could potentially be used to attack U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.This latest launch is the sixth time China has conducted a flight test on the DF-ZF in the past year, the Washington Free Beacon reports.According to the 2015 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review report, the DF-ZF could be deployed by 2020.The DF-ZF was previously known as the Wu-14.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA new form of Internet data delivery is making its way to the market, and it might replace Wi-Fi in the coming years.Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity, uses LED light bulbs to send information, and theoretically can deliver Internet access 100 times faster than Wi-Fi. LED light bulbs emit visible lights, which is a constant stream of photons. When the current is manipulated to create slight fluctuations, a photodetector device can pick up the pulses to convert them into an electrical current, said German physicist Harald Haas during a TED Talk.Haas is a professor of mobile communications at the University of Edinburgh and the founder of pureLiFi, a leading company in Li-Fi technology.An Estonian company, Velmenni, tested the technology and was able to transmit data at 1 gigabyte per second. Theoretically it can deliver speeds of up to 224 gigabytes per second.However, because Li-Fi uses only visible light, it does not work through walls, nor will it work outdoors in the sunlight.In the future, light bulbs could become wireless hotspots and could be utilised on aircraft and in other places where radio signal interference is an issue.Due to its limitations, initial usage of the technology may be restricted to crowded urban areas, or in areas where Wi-Fi usage may not be safe, such as hospitals.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFrench aircraft maker Airbus has come up with a new way to shave off turnaround time between flights  detachable cargo compartments. The U.S. patent designs released detail removable cabins, which could be swapped in and out of an aircraft to increase efficiency for boarding passengers. The concept would also allow planes to fly more frequently, with less time sitting and waiting on the ground.The plans preview how passengers could board a detached cabin from a docking station in advance of a plane’s arrival. Passengers would then be able to seat themselves while ground crews store their luggage, reducing processing time all around. Once the empty aircraft arrives in the terminal, the fully-loaded cabin container would be lowered into the plane, firmly locking into place before the plane takes flight.Once the flight lands at its destination, it pulls into a new gate at the airport, where the removable cabin would detach and be lifted up into a docking station.The plane would quickly be prepared by ground crews to take on a new cabin of passengers.

      <title>Scientists have created malaria resistant mosquitoes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twUniversity of California scientists have recently developed a way to create malaria resistant mosquitoes by genetic modification, which is a significant step toward eliminating malaria in humans.  Affecting half of the world’s population, malaria is caused by mosquitoes carrying the Plasmodium parasite. Sub-saharan Africa carries the highest burden of the deadly disease, accounting for 89% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria-related deaths.Scientists used a genome editing tool called “CRISPR” to alter the Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, a common carrier of malaria. The mosquitoes’ DNA is modified by inserting a “resistance” gene, rendering them unable to carry or pass on the disease. When these genetically modified mosquitoes mate, they pass on the same malaria-resistant gene to their offspring. The new gene was inherited by almost 100% of the offspring across three generations in experiements.Scientists believe that they will be eventually able to naturally spread the edited DNA to almost all mosquitoes in a population within several generations, effectively combating malaria around the world.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. People affected by malaria 2. How malaria is spread3. CRISPR creates malaria resistant mosquitoes4+5. Gene drive and inheritance   VOICEOVER (in English): “Around 3.2 billion people, which is almost half of the world’s population, are at risk of malaria. In 2015, sub-saharan Africa alone accounts for 91% of malaria deaths.”“Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. Humans are infected through bites from infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.”“Using a genome editing tool called CRISPR, scientists have successfully inserted malaria-blocking genes into mosquitoes, making them resistant to infection.” “When an altered mosquito mates with a wild mosquito, the offspring inherits both an edited copy and a normal copy of a gene. The CRISPR tool alters the normal copy to force the cell into replicating the edited version when it repairs the damage, thus resulting in two edited copies.” “Almost 100% of the mosquito offspring tested inherited the malaria-resistant gene.”       SOURCES: RT, BBC, WHO, Nature, STAT, Wiredhttps://www.rt.com/news/323361-malaria-genetically-engineered-mosquitoes/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34898931http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/http://www.nature.com/news/gene-drive-mosquitoes-engineered-to-fight-malaria-1.18858http://www.statnews.com/2015/11/23/malaria-mosquitoes-gene-drive-crispr/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-11/24/malaria-resistant-mosquitoes***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twBlue Origin space travel company conducted a historic test on Monday by successfully launching and landing from Van Horn in Texas a reusable rocket, Space.com reported. Blue Origin was set up by founder and CEO of Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos.Despite costing millions of dollars, rockets can only be used once, as they normally sink to the bottom of the ocean upon landing.The New Shepard space vehicle, however, is able to gently land back on its launch pad, allowing it to be reused.The new rocket consists of a crew capsule for astronauts and a rocket booster powered by a single American-made BE-3 liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen engine, according to Blue Origin’s website.  The rocket used a BE-3 engine to deliver 110,000 pounds of thrust during its Monday launch. Once in space, the crew capsule separated from the booster and floated for several minutes, flying at 100 kilometres above Earth, before deploying parachutes and re-entering the atmosphere. The booster also descended under guided flight. Before landing, it re-ignited the BE-3 engine, which allowed a gentle vertical landing just 1.3 metres from the center of its launch pad. New Shephard descended the last 30 metres at 7 km/h to touch down on the launch pad."I believe this is a new Golden Age of space exploration,” Bezos was quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald as saying. “We are on the verge of a new Golden Age in rocketry. I believe one day all rockets will have landing gear."A reusable rocket could eventually be employed to allow paying passengers trips into space for a few minutes at a time.The rockets are not yet powerful enough to bring a spacecraft into orbit. For that purpose, SpaceX is designing a larger and more powerful reusable rocket that could be launched after December 2015.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Reusable Blue Origin rocket parts 2.

      <title>Canary home security system&#x2019;s algorithm gets smarter over time</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twCanary is a home security system that sends users smart notifications including recorded video clips when unusual motions are detected. “Everyone wants to make sure that their home is safe and that their family is safe,” says Sam Evans, Canary spokesperson. “I think that today with so many kinds of gadgets and the internet, everyone is looking around for smarter alternatives to keep their homes safe.” To distinguish between regular and irregular motions, Canary’s algorithm-based motion detector is supposed to become smarter over time. Canary Head of Communications John Carter says there are two ways the system becomes smarter. First, there is unsupervised learning, which consists of machine learning and computer vision. The system interprets large volumes of data from different devices in order to recognize specific patterns, such as a person entering a doorway or a spinning ceiling fan. Eventually, the system learns these behaviors. Then, there is supervised learning in which users teach Canary what to care about. Users do this by tagging objects, people, motions and activities in the video timeline in the Canary app. Users control what notifications are sent to them by adjusting the sensitivity setting. In October, “we announced that we have an integration with Wink, which means you and your Nest can communicate with other smart objects in the home,” Evans says. Canary costs $199 and is equipped with a wide-angle lens. The device also determines air quality and allows users to connect with local police.RUNDOWN SHOWS:Canary deviceSam Evans, Canary Spokesperson, InterviewCanary’s algorithm-based motion detectorAnimation explaining how Canary’s algorithm becomes smarterEvans interviewCost and additional features of CanaryVOICEOVER (in English): "Canary is a home security system that sends users smart notifications, including recorded video clips when unusual motions are detected.

      <title>Disfigured ex-firefighter receives extensive face transplant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA 41-year-old father of five underwent an extensive full-face transplant last August which saw a 150-person medical team at NYU’s Langone Medical Center perform a procedure that had only a 50 percent chance of success.Reuters reports that in September 2001, volunteer firefighter Patrick Hardison was badly burned in a house fire in Senatobia, Mississippi. He underwent 71 operations over the next fourteen years, as doctors tried to restore his face through skin grafts.Hardison later met plastic surgeon Eduardo Rodriguez, who proposed a full face transplant, according to New York Magazine. After waiting more than a year, a suitable donor was finally found   David Rodebaugh, a 26-year-old bike mechanic who was fatally injured in a cycling accident.The procedure, which took place on August 14, 2015, involved slitting the skin at the back of Rodebaugh’s head, peeling off each side toward the ears while including key pieces of bone around the nose, chin and cheekbones.After the scarred tissue on Hardison’s face was cut away, the donor face was laid over his head and secured into position using screws and metal plates  a grueling 26-hour operation.Hardison’s new face swelled by 50 percent immediately after, but gradually calmed down with the help of immunosuppressants he will need to take for the rest of his life.The entire operation cost between $850,000 and $1 million, the same cost as a liver transplant, and was paid for by a university grant, according to the Guardian.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Beddit Smart device tracks users&#x2019; sleeping patterns</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twBeddit Smart is a sleep tracker that is designed to help users convert their ordinary beds into smart beds with an ultra-thin sensor that is placed between the bed sheet and mattress.  “You just lay on it. You don’t have to wear anything,” says Dean Tucker, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Beddit. “You don’t have to turn anything on. You just go to sleep and it tracks your sleep.” The sensor measures heart rate, respiration, and movement. A microphone on the user’s mobile device detects snoring. “We’re using a piezoelectric sensor, it literally is a microphone,” Tucker says. “And, so what we’re able to do is look at the way your body creates the electrical impulses through the sensor.” The device tracks upper and lower respiration, and measures the heart muscle by capturing readings before and after the heart beats, according to Tucker. “As your heart beats, what happens is there’s these little micro movements that your body creates.” The system connects to a mobile device app that allows users to their daily Beddit ScoreCard, which includes tips on how to improve their sleep. Tucker also says the sleep tracker can also detect if it’s the user who is sleeping on the sensor or if it’s someone beside the user. “Think of it like amplitude. So, we’re measuring this big signal that’s you and we’re throwing out the noise that’s all of this other stuff that’s going on in the background,” he says. The device includes a smart alarm that wakes up the user based on whether or not they’ve gotten enough sleep. Beddit costs US $149.95 and recently launched its first Apple Watch app.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>U.S. uterus transplants could help infertile women get pregnant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA team in Ohio is spearheading an experimental surgery, the first of its kind in the U.S.,  that may prove to be significant for infertile women wishing to carry a baby to full term.The New York Times reports that the Cleveland Clinic is starting trials for a uterine transplant procedure that could help some 50,000 women born without a uterus or with uterus problems, get pregnant.The team began screening candidates in September. Ten women, aged 21-39, will undergo the procedure following extensive medical and psychological evaluation. Once a patient is approved for the procedure, she is given hormones to stimulate egg production. Multiple eggs are fertilized in vitro and the embryos are frozen.When a suitable donor is found, the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina is removed and must be transplanted into the pelvis within six to eight hours. The uterus is connected to the recipient’s vagina, and the uterine vessels, normally wound around the ureters, are redirected to the larger blood vessels around the pelvis.A year later, embryos are implanted one at a time into the fully-healed uterus until the patient becomes pregnant. After giving birth to one or two babies via C-section, the transplanted uterus will be removed to prevent patients from having to continuously take anti-rejection drugs, according to the Cleveland Clinic.In Sweden, nine uterine transplants from live donors resulted in five pregnancies and four live births. In the U.S., deceased organ donors will be used to minimize complications.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Baby born without a uterus2. In vitro fertilization3. Uterus transplant4. Embryo transfer after a year5.

      <title>Earth-like planet found outside solar system</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.tw A new Earth-like planet dubbed GJ 1332b has been discovered by astronomers at the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory in La Serena, Chile.  To detect it, researchers used the MEarth-South array, a group of eight 40cm robotic telescopes, and sighted it moving across the face of its M-dwarf star. Despite the planet being cooler than the sun, the closeness to the M-dwarf star makes its surface temperature reach 260 degrees Celsius. The research was published in the journal Nature. According to the Guardian, the new planet, which is about 16 percent larger than the Earth, completes an orbit every 1.6 days. Its composition is rocky and apparently similar to the one of the Earth.Although too hot to be habitable, astronomers believe GJ 1132b is cool enough to retain an atmosphere. If the planet lacks an atmosphere it may be due to the UV light and particle storms that the M-dwarf star emits, reported Gizmodo.According to the Guardian, the discovery of this planet could make it a prime target for future research missions.

      <title>Mars&#x2019; larger moon Phobos is slowly falling apart, NASA says</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNASA scientists have discovered that grooves found on Phobos, the larger of Mars’ two moons, are signs that it is slowly breaking apart, according to an article published by NASA on Tuesday.Scientists previously believed that the grooves radiated from Stickney, the largest crater on Phobos. Another theory posited that the cracks were caused by small impacts of material thrown off of Mars that crashed onto the moon’s surface.According to findings presented Nov. 10, 2015, at the annual Meeting of the Division of Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society at National Harbor, Maryland by NASA researcher Terry Hurford and his colleagues, Phobos’ shallow grooves have been caused by tidal forces created by Mars and the moon’s gravitational pull.Phobos’ interior, according to NASA, consists of rubble surrounded by a layer of powdery regolith about 100 meters thick.	The stress forces will only increase, as Phobos orbits at 6,000 kilometers from Mars and is being pulled closer to the Red Planet by about two meters every hundred years.Researchers believe this will result in the moon’s destruction in about 30 to 50 million years.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Chemicals sprayed on top of BP oil spill did not help disperse oil, says new study</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twResearch led by a team at the University of Georgia shows that the chemical agents used to remove oil from the ocean’s surface after the 2010 BP oil spill didn’t fully degrade the oil and instead suppressed microbes in the water that would have been more effective in cleaning up the oil.After the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20, 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico and leaked 210 million gallons of oil into the ocean, authorities worked for months just to contain the spill. Corexit oil dispersant, a chemical agent that breaks up oil into smaller clusters, was sprayed from planes. Although the water affected appeared to be getting cleaner month after month, researchers say that a closer look at the bacteria and chemicals in the water proves otherwise.Corexit has affected populations of oil-eating microbes in the Gulf called marinobacters. A bacteria less effective at digesting oil, called colwellia, digested the Corexit, and their populations have since multiplied, while marinobacter populations have dwindled. It’s still unclear whether the marinobacter populations dwindled because of the direct effect of the chemical agents, or because they are being outcompeted by the colwellia bacteria. Consequently, Corexit has slowed down the natural breaking down process of oil in the ocean and hampered overall cleanup efforts. Previous studies have shown that microbes removed about 43 to 61 percent of the spill, while the rest of the oil either sank to the bottom or remains unaccounted for.This study comes just months after BP agreed to pay $18.7 billion to settle all economic and environmental claims made by four states and 400 local governments.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and resulting oil spill2.

Studies show that microbes removed about 43 to 61 percent of the spill, while the rest either sank to the bottom or remains unaccounted for.”SOURCES: Christian Science Monitor, Insight Ticker, Discoveryhttp://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2015/1110/BP-oil-spill-dispersants-hindered-oil-eating-microbes-study-sayshttp://insightticker.com/2015/11/11/1768/bps-dispersant-oil-spill-clean-up-proven-ineffective/http://news.discovery.com/earth/oceans/oil-eating-microbes-foiled-by-gulf-spill-dispersants-151110.htm***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>China conducts flight test of new DN-3 missile, alleged satellite-killer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twChina has flight tested a new missile, which the United States and Western defense analysts believe is designed to destroy satellites. On October 30th, China conducted a flight test of it’s new Dong Neng-3 missile from the Korla Missile Test Complex, according to The Washington Free Beacon. The test was China’s eighth since 2005. International concern over China’s anti-satellite missile program has grown since 2007, when China destroyed a disused weather satellite, littering the space around Earth with debris to this day. Analyst Bill Gertz writes that the new missile, like it’s predecessor the Dong Neng-2, is designed to destroy satellites. China maintains that the missiles are purely defensive, meant to intercept incoming ballistic missiles, not to destroy satellites. The older DN-2 was a three-stage missile based on a satellite launch vehicle, with a kinetic warhead. The new DN-3 may be a modified DN-2 or a completely new design. A U.S. congressional report says China’s anti-satellite missiles can only fly on pre-determined flight paths, and only strikes satellites over China’s territory. The report also says that China disguises the missiles’ intended purpose by calling the tests “land-based missile interception tests.”In May 2013, a DN-2 missile nearly reached geosynchronous orbit, threatening intelligence and navigation satellites.

This indicates the presence of an internal heat source, which is speculated to be originating from radioactive elements in the core.With only 20% of New Horizons’ data downlinked to Earth, scientists will have to wait for the remaining pictures and measurements from the July encounter to confirm cryovolcanism on the dwarf planet.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>British passenger jet flying over Egypt narrowly dodged missile last August</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA plane filled with British holidaymakers reportedly narrowly avoided disaster last August after it took evasive action to avoid an incoming missile, according to a Sky News report. Thomson Airways Flight 476 was making its way from London's Stansted airport to Sharm el Sheikh on August 23rd, when, as it neared the Egyptian resort's airport, the pilot reportedly spotted a projectile believed to have been a missile, in the aircraft's trajectory.  Citing an unnamed source, the Daily Mail reported that the aircraft's captain ordered the first officer, who was in charge at the time, to turn left and the plane narrowly dodged the missile which reportedly came within 300 meters (1,000ft) of the jet, which was carrying 189 passengers.Britain's Department of Transport, who confirmed the incident, said the missile was likely related to Egyptian military exercises rather than being part of a targeted attack against the plane.The aircraft landed safely and vacationers aboard were not informed of the incident. News of the episode comes a week after the as-yet unexplained crash of a Russian Metrojet airliner that took the lives of 224 people leaving the Red Sea resort.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Plane flying2.

      <title>Gene-edited immune cells clear baby&#x2019;s &#x2018;incurable&#x2019; leukemia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA baby girl in Britain suffering from leukemia has become the first person in the world to receive an experimental gene editing procedure that miraculously reversed her cancer.According to CBS News, Layla Richards had been diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) when she was just 14-week-old. Layla’s family was losing hope after several failed treatments, until a team of doctors at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital performed an experimental gene editing procedure on her that saved her life.This technology is known as TALEN, which had only been previously tested on mice. It uses molecular tools that act like scissors to cut specific genes in order to make the T-cells from healthy donors to behave in two specific ways: first, the cells are able to become invisible to a powerful leukemia drug that would normally kill them; second, they are reprogrammed to target and fight against leukemia cells only.Layla spent several months in isolation due to her extremely weak immune system after the procedure. After the leukemia cells were confirmed to have been eliminated from Layla’s body, she was given a bone marrow transplant to replace her entire blood and immune system, CBS News reported.The treatment was prepared by scientists at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London and French biotech company Cellectis. Cellectis is going to fund full clinical trials of the therapy starting next year, Reuters reported.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Layla Richards has Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia2.

This is the most common type of cancer in children.”“In a healthy child, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells that can become myeloid stem cells or lymphoid stem cells, which then develop into mature red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells.”“However, in a child with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, too many stem cells develop into lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes, which are in fact leukemia cells.”“The leukemia cells are not able to fight infection and they take up the space for healthy blood cells in the blood and bone marrow. This may lead to infection, anemia and easy bleeding.”“Doctors in London performed a new gene-editing technology known as TALEN on Layla, which had previously only been tested on mice.”“The technology uses molecular tools that act like scissors to cut specific genes in order to make the T-cells from healthy donors behave in two specific ways.”“First, the cells are able to become invisible to a powerful leukemia drug that would normally kill them.”“Second, they are reprogrammed to target and fight against leukemia cells only.”“Layla spent several months in isolation due to her extremely weak immune system after the procedure.”“After the leukemia cells were confirmed to have been eliminated from Layla’s body, she was given a bone marrow transplant to replace her entire blood and immune system.”SOURCES: CBS News, Reuters, U.S. National Cancer Institutehttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-of-its-kind-designer-immune-cells-cure-babys-leukemia/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/06/us-health-leukaemia-cellectis-idUSKCN0SU2PO20151106#doD0MpZoHffm8mGV.97http://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/child-all-treatment-pdq]]></description>

      <title>White House has plan to counter catastrophic solar storms</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNo internet. No mobile phones. No electricity to power refrigerators, run the vacuum cleaner or keep the lights on. No respite for weeks or possibly months. No Netflix. This is what would happen should a massive solar storm hit Earth, the threat of which the White House is taking seriously.In October, the White House published a 19-page paper outlining preparations and responses to massive solar electromagnetic pulses (EMP) that could potentially cripple key infrastructure.Dubbed the “National Space Weather Strategy,” the document calls for more studies on potential effects of space weather on power grids; more research to better model and predict space weather; and more cooperation among scientists and agencies at the international level, among other proposals.Scientists for years have warned of the potential dangers of solar EMPs. In 2013, insurance company Lloyd’s of London estimated the economic fallout as high as $2.6 trillion should a massive storm hit.Space weather can be traced to coronal mass ejections, or huge bursts of gas most often associated with solar flares. These solar storms send huge quantities of electromagnetic radiation toward Earth. That’s not good for power grids. A solar EMP could take entire power grids offline, plunging the world into darkness. In 1859, one of the biggest solar storms ever recorded hit Earth, in what scientists now call the Carrington event. Society before the start of the Civil War didn’t depend on electricity as we do today. So the impact was limited to disrupted telegraph lines and shocked telegraph operators. But the world today wouldn’t get off so easy. In 1989, a much smaller solar storm caused the collapse of Hydro-Quebec’s electricity transmission system, resulting in a nine-hour power outage.In 2012, we got lucky. Scientists observed a solar storm believed to be as big the Carrington event. Fortunately, because the sun rotates on its own axis, Earth was facing away from the storm and missed it by about nine days.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Depiction of coronal mass ejection2.

      <title>Workers find skeletons, coffins in burial vaults under Washington Square Park</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Dozens of skeletal remains were unearthed in the Big Apple just days after Halloween near an area that used to be a public burial ground.According to Fox 5, contractors for the New York City Department of Design and Construction were digging to replace water mains near Washington Square Park earlier this week when they discovered crypts containing human remains three feet beneath the ground.Two 15-by-20 foot burial vaults were discovered side-by-side, each with a wooden door and about 8 feet deep. One crypt contained the skeletal remains of about 9 to 12 people, while the other had wooden coffins stacked one on top of the other, reports the New York Post.Both are believed to date back to the late 18th or early 19th century, and was likely part of a cemetery that may have belonged to one of two Presbyterian churches that stood in the area.Archaeologists working with the city are investigating the vaults and will be focusing on identifying those buried.

      <title>France to deploy largest warship against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFrance is set to deploy its largest warship to aid in the US-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the French president’s office said in a statement issued on Thursday after a defense cabinet meeting.France will deploy the Charles de Gaulle, a 860-foot-long French carrier that can carry up to 40 aircraft and support 100 flights a day. The carrier is usually accompanied by an attack submarine, several frigates, refuelling ships, as well as fighter jets and surveillance aircraft, reported Reuters. The warship has two aircraft strips for taking-off in the front and one for landing in the back, according to Business Insider. The ship will reportedly reduce the time it takes for French jets to carry out airstrikes, reported BBC. The French is currently using six Mirage jets stationed in Jordan and six Rafale jets in the United Arab Emirates to carry out airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq. France has carried out 271 airstrikes in 1,285 aerial missions in Iraq and two known airstrikes in Syria since September 2014, according to Agence France-Presse.The warship, the only one of its kind in France’s fleet, is usually joined with attack submarine, frigates ships, refueling ships, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft, Reuters reported. It is also the only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier outside the United States. This is the second time the ship will be deployed against ISIS, the ship was previously stationed in the Persian Gulf and used as a base for French jets from February to April, BBC reported.The French have declared the airstrikes as self defense after an IS militant killed 17 people in Paris in the beginning of the year.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Italy purchase of arms for Reaper drones approved by U.S. State Department</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twTwo U.S. officials have told Reuters that the U.S. government has vetted and approved Italy’s request to buy armaments for their U.S. made drone aircraft. Italy first requested to buy armaments for its two U.S. made MQ-9 Reaper drones in 2012. According to the officials, the U.S. State Department has approved the sale to Italy of 156 AGM-113R2 Hellfire II missiles, 20 GBU-12 laser-guided bombs, 30 GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions, and others. Italy would be the second country after the United Kingdom to receive approval to buy armaments for it’s large U.S. made drones. In February 2015, the U.S. government enacted a new export policy governing the sale of large drones, such as the MQ-9 Reaper, and drone armaments, requiring that buyers undergo review by the U.S. State Department. Under the policy, buyers of military drones must agree not to use the drones for unlawful surveillance and may not use the drones to crack down on their domestic populations. Speaking of the government's approval of Italy’s request, one official told Reuters, "It's not a decision we've taken lightly, and it's symbolic of our trust in Italy as a partner." "Italy is a responsible member of the international community and they have been with us in every significant recent NATO and U.S.-led operation." The arms sale to Italy is valued at $129.6 million dollars, with defense contractor General Atomics acting as prime contractor. The U.S. Congress has 15 days to veto the sale of drone armaments to Italy, but is expected to allow the sale to proceed. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Italian unarmed MQ-9 Reaper drone2.

      <title>FCC investigates Chinese covert radio company in the U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA special investigative report by Reuters showed that the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department is conducting a federal investigation on a California radio company that is reportedly backed by a subsidiary of the Chinese government. Reuters reports that G&E Studio Inc., a Los Angeles-based company, is 60 percent owned by a subsidiary of China Radio International, a Chinese state-run broadcaster based in Beijing. The California radio firm is owned by James Su, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Shanghai.The FCC monitors indecency and political advertising in news content but otherwise does not restrict content broadcast on U.S. radio stations. By U.S. law, foreign governments or their representatives are not allowed to own more than 25% of a station’s U.S. parent corporation without FCC approval.In a Sept. 16 interview, Su said that he is merely a businessman and not an agent of China. “Our U.S. audience and our U.S. public has the choice,” Su said. “They can choose to listen or not listen. I think this is an American value.”Su also argued that the company is not doing anything illegal since it does not own any U.S. radio stations, but only leases air time from two radio stations.G&E Studio Inc. broadcasts over 14 different cities in the U.S., including Boston, Washington, Philadelphia and San Francisco. There are at least 33 radio stations in 14 countries in CRI’s global network.Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the U.S. requires anyone seeking to influence U.S. public opinion on behalf of foreign agents to register with the Justice Department. However, neither Su nor his companies are registered.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. CRI owns 60% of G&E Studio Inc.2. By law, foreign agencies are prohibited from owning more than 25% of U.S. based stations3.

      <title>Modern cars are increasingly vulnerable to hackers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAs modern cars become increasingly reliant on technology it also leaves them highly susceptible to hacking. Last year, according to Cambridge News, Londoners experienced more than 6000 vehicle thefts city due to hacking. A car hack demonstration involving a Wired journalist in July showed hackers controlling a Chrysler Jeep Cherokee wirelessly from a laptop. They managed to gain remote access to the car by exploiting the vehicle celluar network and rewriting firmware on one of its chips.Hackers have also been reported to gain access to cars through Wi-Fi and bluetooth connections. Once connected, hackers may extract binary code, reverse engineer software, tamper with it and send the corrupted program back to the car. The hacker can potentially control everything from the brakes and doors, to the airbags and engine.It is estimated that by 2020, 75% of cars shipped globally will have Internet connectivity.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Car driving on highway is hacked2. Parts of car vulnerable to attack3. How hacking works4. Vulnrability of modern cars to attacksVOICEOVER (in English): “With modern cars becoming increasingly computerized, hackers are able to exploit security holes to remotely take control of vehicles.”“It is possible for a skilled hacker to get into a driver’s mobile app, a car’s entertainment center, on-board diagnostics, air bags, locks, as well critical systems like the engine and brakes.” “Hackers can use a car’s cellular, Wi-Fi or bluetooth connections to gain access. The software can then be read and altered code inserted back into the car’s computers.” “Many modern cars contain more than 100 computer processors, leaving them susceptible to hacking and privacy attacks not possible on older vehicles.

      <title>British scientists create tractor beam which uses sound to move objects</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA team of British scientists has successfully created a tractor beam, that used sound to levitate objects without contact.The technology was co-developed by scientists at the Universities of Sussex and Bristol, and a company called Ultrahaptics, which made the 64 mini loudspeakers that can produce precisely timed sound waves with accuracy to the microsecond level used in the experiments, according to a press release by the University of Sussex.Scientists experimented using three acoustic fields: the first one is a tweezer-like beam that can grip, move and rotate a small object. The second one behaves like an acoustic vortex which can hold the object in space. The third field works like a cage, trapping the object. Researchers were able to move the object by simply moving the cage.The technology has been used to levitate tiny polystyrene balls that measure up to 5 mm across. However, the acoustic force could be used to levitate bigger and heavier objects by increasing the sound intensity, CBS News reported.“We can move bigger and heavier objects than we have done, but the main application is going smaller to manipulate things inside the human body,” the Guardian quoted Asier Marzo, PhD student and the lead author as saying. The team is now looking into the possibilities of adapting the technology to medical use.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Mini Loudspeakers send out sound waves 2.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twABSTRACT GOES HERE (DO NOT ADD DATELINE)A team at Scripps Research Institute has discovered a new therapy that could prove to be a safer way to battle cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by an overproduction of immature white blood cells that are unable to function properly or fight infection, and interfere with normal blood cell production.Current cancer treatments stop the growth of cancer cells, but almost always damage or destroy other healthy cells, reports Medical Daily.Scientists found that applying certain antibodies to AML cells triggered them to mature into natural killer cells that support the immune system. These natural killer cells then destroy related AML cancer cells, but leave unrelated cancer cells alone, prompting researchers to call the technique fratricidin therapy, according to IFL Science.In a single day, natural killer cells in one sample destroyed 15% of their cancerous kin, suggesting that a safer, more effective form of treatment could be well on its way. The Scripps team is working to be able to test the new therapy on human patients soon.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cancer in blood2. Current cancer treatments 3. Antibodies turn cancer cells to NK cells4.

      <title>Huge drugs tunnel discovered under US-Mexico border</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA massive state-of-the-art tunnel used to smuggle drugs between Mexico and the US was discovered by authorities during a raid, federal officials announced on Wednesday. The tunnel, connecting warehouses in Otay Mesa, near San Diego, and Tijuana in Mexico was discovered on Wednesday following simultaneous raids on both sides of the border.Officials said the tunnel was about 30 feet deep and around 2,400 feet long and featured lighting, (pause) a ventilation system, (pause) and rail tracks for transportation of the drugs.While pulleys were believed to be used by the smugglers for loading and unloading on the U.S. side of the tunnel, according to police. The bust came after a six-month operation by Homeland Security’s ICE division that saw undercover agents arrange to provide drivers for the smugglers.Sixteen people were arrested in Mexico and six were detained in the U.S., while a total of 12 tonnes of marijuana was recovered. Mexican police said that two of the suspects told them they were working for a drug cartel operating in the state of Jalisco  a reference to the Jalisco New Generation that is linked to the cartel of Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman, who escaped from a maximum security prison in July.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Real life &#x2018;Death Star&#x2019; observed destroying planets in its own solar system</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA dying star is ripping apart planets in its own solar system, according to a team of astronomers who published a paper yesterday in the journal Nature.The star, called WD 1145+017, is a white dwarf in the constellation Virgo. The finding was made by Andrew Vanderburg, a graduate student at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in March. The white dwarf was spotted by NASA’s Kepler space telescope as part of the spacecraft’s K2 mission, the Boston Globe reported.Vanderburg saw a regular dip in brightness of the white dwarf every four-and-a-half hours. This suggested an object was orbiting the white dwarf at a distance of about 840,000 kilometres, about twice the distance between Earth and the Moon. After analysing data from the ground-based telescopes, Vanderburg concluded that the signal was caused by the disintegration process of the planet by the white dwarf’s gravitational pull, ABC Australia reported.“We’ve caught a star in the act of destroying a planet in its own system,” Vanderburg told the Boston Globe. “It’s like the smoking gun.”After a regular star uses up its nuclear fuel, it expands and turns into a red giant. Red giants are hot enough to convert helium into carbon. However, when its helium fuel has been exhausted, a red giant starts to contract and become more compact, eventually turning into a white dwarf, a leftover of the star’s inner core.A white dwarf is extremely dense, and its gravitational pull is so enormous that it can tear an orbiting planet apart. Astronomers believe that when a planet orbits closer than the habitable zone, it can be disintegrated by the gravitational pull of a white dwarf.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>What is a Dyson sphere?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twLast week several media outlets covered a research paper speculating, among other possibilities, what debris surrounding a distant star may be.In the paper submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, a team of scientists led by Yale postdoctoral fellow Tabetha Boyajian, researchers speculate the debris may be an asteroid belt or comets, the Atlantic reports. However, others believe the debris could be extraterrestrial megastructures.One popular idea of what the space debris might be is a Dyson Sphere  an energy-absorbing megastructure that envelopes a star, reports the Independent.  According to All About Space, this hypothetical megastructure functions as a power station, absorbing the star’s energy output and eventually energy from the surrounding galaxy, harnessing power from the sun in a similar fashion a solar panel. Another idea is that the structure may be a swarm of thousands of satellites tethered together, collecting energy and sending it to a central location.This is similar to the notion of space-based solar power (SBSP), where a gigantic spacecraft placed between the earth and the moon would collect energy from the sun and transmit it to earth, reports All About Space.According to the Independent, Freeman Dyson, the man who popularized the Dyson sphere concept in 1960, has sought to distance himself from the theory. However, that hasn’t stopped the concept from being widely used in science fiction, comics and television.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Shell of Dyson sphere surrounding the star2.

      <title>New material from orange peel could solve mercury pollution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA team of Australian researchers may have found a cheap, sustainable way to solve the global problem of mercury contamination. According to The Conversation, the major sources of mercury in Australian waters come from industries involved in water supply and sewage, metal manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, and mining. Mercury pollution seeps into waterways and gets turned into methylmercury by organisms in the water.The toxic substance accumulates in the tissues of seafood and fish, with those at the top of the food chain containing potentially toxic levels, thus exposing people to it mainly through ingestion. As a neurotoxin, methylmercury attacks the brain and nervous system, causing problems for the kidneys and developing fetuses.To combat this, researchers at Flinders University created a sulphur-limonene polymer using two waste products- sulfur and citrus peel  to act as a mercury trap. The dark red material works by attracting mercury, which binds firmly to the polymer, turning it yellow-green in the process.With production costs relatively low, the non-toxic material may be used to coat pipes and as filters, or even in large-scale cleanup operations for heavily contaminated areas, reports Business Insider Australia.

The device connects to wearable fabric sensors called DrumPants.  “Hitting a DrumPants trigger could now trigger a phrase on your phone,” says Tyler Freeman, creator of DrumPants and co-founder of Tappur, a San Francisco startup. TAPS stands for “trigger activated personal assistant.” Freeman collaborated with Michael Zinn, a rehabilitation support worker based in Canada, to develop the TAPS app.    “People with brain injuries who had difficulty speaking, they can use this,” he says. “TAPS gives them an easy way to communicate,” The device works when the user straps the fabric sensors to their body, or use Velcro to attach them to the user’s clothes. These fabric sensors are velocity sensitive, meaning the harder they’re hit, the louder they produce sound. The system uses a “text-to-speech” engine, so it can be programmed to say what the user wants when phrases are typed into the app on a smartphone or tablet. The phrases are then assigned to each trigger. A Bluetooth enabled control unit connects the triggers to the app. This results in the app speaking for the user when the sensors are tapped. TAPS is currently beta testing. Since individuals with limited mobility still need help programming each trigger, according to Zinn, they’re developing an external keyboard for mobile devices.

      <title>Russia and the ESA set sites on permanent moon colony with planned landing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe European Space Agency and its Russian counterpart are sending a lander to the moon’s south pole as part of their plan to settle humans permanently on Earth’s closest neighbor.In one of a number of missions led by the Russian Federal Space Agency, it and the ESA hope to land the Luna 27 probe on the moon’s South Pole Aitken Basin in 2020. The spacecraft’s mission is to assess whether or not there is enough raw material on the moon’s surface to support human life during future missions. As parts of the south pole are shielded from the heat of the sun, the region is darker and colder than other sections of the moon. The environment has allowed water to collect and freeze at the surface of the moon and scientists say that this water could be used as a potential resource for the future.The ESA already has ideas about what these future missions may be as the agency hopes to build lunar habitats in the lunar south pole as early as 2024. The agency plans to deploy inflatable domes on the moon’s surface as shelter for astronauts. 3D-printing robots will be sent to the moon and will be used to build a layer of dirt around the domes.The ESA says the lunar base they hope to build within the next decade could replace the International Space Station as the new base for astronauts to experience life in space. Scientists also hope that the moon base will help astronauts prepare for later missions to Mars. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Location of the probe landing site on the moon2.

      <title>Anti-drone weapon developed for civilian use in Ohio</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.tw Ohio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, a private non-profit group, has announced the development of an anti-drone weapon designed for safe civilian use. The DroneDefender is a shoulder-mounted, rechargeable rifle-like weapon that takes drones, or UAVs, offline with a blast of radio waves. The Drone Defender weighs 4.5 kilos, or 10 pounds, and can target a drone up to 400 meters, or over 1300 feet away. The rifle fires waves of electromagnetic energy tuned to common GPS and ISM frequencies, disabling the UAV by blocking it from receiving commands. Radio waves from a DroneDefender should activate the disabled drone’s safety protocol, making it hover, land or return to its point of origin. Battelle says the defender could be used to protect prisons, schools or historical sites and of course has military and law enforcement applications as well. No information on the price of the DroneDefender has yet been released, but the device is expected to go on sale in 2016.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The DroneDefender developed by the Battelle Institute 2.

      <title>New study links dietary supplements to more than 20,000 ER visits a year</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA new study by the U.S. federal government discovered that weight loss and energy boosting supplements cause more than 20,000 emergency-room visits a year, the New York Times reported. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, first tracked emergency room visits at 63 hospitals in the U.S. over 10 years, then analyzed those ER visits in which a dietary supplement was implicated. It found that there were about 23,000 emergency-room visits per year linked to dietary supplements, and that more than a quarter of them occurred among people aged 20 to 34.Roughly 10 percent, or about 2,150 cases yearly, were serious enough to require hospitalization.Symptoms included, among others, severe allergic reactions, heart trouble, chest pain, nausea and vomiting, and were tied to dietary supplements including herbal pills, amino acids, and vitamins, which, according to medical experts, are often adulterated with toxic chemicals.Unlike prescription drugs, dietary supplements marketed for weight loss and energy do not have to be approved by the FDA before they are sold to consumers, and do not have to carry any safety label nor a list of side effects.

      <title>Herbal viagra use can lead to dangerously low blood pressure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twWhile herbal viagra claims to be purely herbal, ingredients vary per brand and are often unlisted. The FDA has warned against using these herbal supplements, as they are not subject to the same standards as prescription drugs.According to the Mayo Clinic, viagra is a prescription medication that uses Sildenafil to stimulate an erection by increasing blood flow to the penis. Herbal or natural alternatives to viagra purportedly do the same, but often have unlisted ingredients. The British National Health Service warns that some brands, such as ‘Jia Yi Jian’, include prescription-only drugs Taladafil, used for erectile dysfunction, and Sibutramine, which is used to treat obesity. This brand of herbal viagra uses double the maximum dosage of Taladafil and four times the allowed amount of Sibutramine.The danger in using herbal viagra is that unlike regular viagra, the increase in blood flow applies to other body parts as well, not just the penis. This can lead to a rapid drop in blood pressure, even restricting blood flow to vital organs, especially when taken with heart disease medication, anti-depressants, or alcohol, reports the Los Angeles Times.Compared to viagra, which sells for more than $40 for one pill, a 30-capsule bottle of herbal viagra costs much less.

      <title>New research shows elephants could help in the battle against cancer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twIn a study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, scientists reported findings of a gene in elephants that may help in the fight against cancer.Elephants, similar to humans, have lifespans of around 70 years or more, but they have 100 times more cells than humans and their cells rarely mutate into cancer. Only 4.8% of known elephant deaths are related to cancer, while for humans, cancer-related deaths are between 11% and 25%.According to the Los Angeles Times, scientists have found that African elephants have 20 copies of a gene called TP53, which creates a protein that suppresses tumors. Humans, on the other hand, inherit only one TP53: one allele from each of their parents. If one of them is defective, cancer is certain to develop sooner or later.When there is DNA damage, the gene churns out copies of its p53 protein and it either stops the cells from dividing, so the DNA can be repaired or destroy the affected cell, so it won’t pass on potentially harmful mutations.Dr Trevor Graham, a tumor biology specialist from the Barts Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University of London, told the LA Times, that reinforcing of the protection offered by TP53 in humans, would be enough to prevent human cells from becoming cancerous.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>U.S. Navy expected to sail close to islands in contested South China Sea</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The United States Navy has signalled its intention to sail a surface ship close to Chinese artificial islands in the South China Sea to demonstrate Washington doesn't view the reclaimed land as sovereign territory.A U.S. official speaking to the Financial Times on the condition of anonymity said the Navy would sail a ship within the 12 nautical mile territorial zone claimed by China in the Spratly archipelago sometime within the next two weeks.The Navy Times reports that officials  said the  move could happen "within days," following formal approval from the Obama Administration.China claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea as its territory, a contested area extending deep into Southeast Asia.  Here, China has been busy constructing artificial islands on submerged reefs and wants to enforce territorial no-go zones around this reclaimed land.Under the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, a navy ship can may pass within 12 nautical miles of territory without conducting military operations, this is known as “innocent passage.”The U.S. Navy plans to conduct such a maneuver near the Spratly Islands  to signal it doesn’t recognise China’s absolute claim on the area.China’s South China Sea claim is also contested by Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan, countries whose 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones overlap with China’s Claim. The U.S. says it wants to support free passage per international law.U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Scott Swift told the New York Times that Washington does not recognize any of China’s territorial claims in the area.]]></description>

      <title>TZOA air-monitoring device can tell if your air is clean or dirty</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twTZOA, a Canada-based startup, is developing environmental-trackers for researchers and consumers to monitor air pollution. According to studies conducted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), “indoor levels of pollutants may be two to five times ­– and occasionally more than 100 times – higher than outdoor pollutant levels.”  In order to determine air quality, a small fan sucks air into the device and blows it across a laser. The laser then scatters the light from the particles onto a light detector. The system counts the number of particles by scanning the pulses of light. The intensity of the light helps determine if it’s a big particle, such as pollen, or a small particle, such as cooking pollution. Ambient conditions, such as temperature, humidity and UV are then viewed on a smartphone. TZOA also has a smaller consumer version that people can wear throughout the day. Earlier this summer, TZOA’s Indiegogo campaign raised more than $88,000, which is 152 percent of its original goal. The TZOA research costs $600 and its consumer version costs $139.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Plastic eating worms might help reduce the environmental impact of garbage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Researchers led by scientists at Stanford University in U.S. and Beihang University in China have found that the mealworm can safely biodegrade various types of plastic, Stanford News reported.  Americans discard about 33 million tonnes of plastic every year, less than 10 percent of which gets recycled.A solution to this problem may be the mealworm - the larvae form of the darkling beetle -which researchers in an ongoing study found can subsist on a diet of Styrofoam and other forms of polystyrene. The bacteria in the mealworm’s gut is able to biodegrade the plastic as part of its digestive process.Researchers found that 100 mealworms were able to eat between 34 and 39 milligrams of Styrofoam per day, which is about the weight of a small pill. The worms converted about half of the Styrofoam into carbon dioxide, while they excreted the bulk of the remaining plastic as biodegraded fragments.Worms on the plastic diet remained healthy, and their droppings appeared to be safe for use as soil for crops. According to a Stanford University press release, the study is important because it contradicts the belief that Styrofoam is a non-biodegradable type of plastic.“Our findings have opened a new door to solve the global plastic pollution problem,”  Wei-Min Wu, a senior research engineer in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford, said in a statement.According to Christian Science Monitor, the bacteria that allows mealworms to digest Styrofoam safely was originally discovered in 2009 by a Taiwanese high-school student named Tseng I-ching. However, he was not able to find out how the process occurs.  RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Unrecyclable plastic garbage in the US per year 2. The worm and its plastic diet 3.

      <title>UK to build &#xA3;25M Jamaican prison in prisoner transfer deal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twUK Prime Minister David Cameron recently announced plans to sign a prisoner transfer deal that will use £25 million of British foreign aid money to build a prison in Jamaica that can fit up to 1,500 inmates.The Guardian reports that under the terms of the agreement, Jamaican prisoners in the UK with a more than four year sentence, and who still have more than 18 months left to serve by the year 2020 will be repatriated and sent to the new prison. Due to poor conditions in Jamaican prisons, inmates are unable to be deported, for fear that doing so would allow them to challenge their imprisonment under human rights law. Jamaicans make up the 3rd largest prison population of foreigners in the UK. Of the more than 600 who are currently imprisoned, roughly 69% are in for drug and violence related charges. According to the BBC, about 300 of these existing offenders are eligible to be transferred in 2020. The UK has struck similar agreements with Albania, Nigeria, Somaliland, Rwanda, and Libya. Officials have claimed the deal will save British taxpayers up to £10 million pounds in taxes per year, according to Time. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Location of new prison2.

      <title>Airbus files U.S. patent for economy class &#x2018;sleeping boxes&#x2019;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twEuropean aircraft manufacturer Airbus has filed a patent in the United States for economy-class “sleeping boxes” for long haul international flights. According to the application filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the sleeping boxes, to be made of plastic or fiber-reinforced plastic, would be stacked beside and on top of each other in the rear of the aircraft. Walls are padded for safety and boxes are positioned in such a way that passengers lie perpendicular to the direction of the flight, which is reportedly safer in the event of a crash or aircraft turbulence. Each unit would be equipped with a personal TV, reclining pillows, a reading light, and video camera, which would allow flight attendants to monitor passengers. A personal service unit consisting of an emergency oxygen mask, individual air conditioning vent, loud speaker, and lamp would also be available in each box. Passengers will still need to be strapped in, but the sleeping boxes can be occupied even during taxi, takeoff, and landing. In-flight meals will be served directly to those occupying boxes, though there is an option to buy an additional seat on top of a sleeping box. Another option is for two passengers to share a sleeping box and a seat, using them alternately. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Airbus aircraft2. Sleeping boxes3. Individual amenities4.

Ten British women will be selected for a womb transplant clinical trial if they are under 38, are of healthy weights and have long term partners.Dr. Richard Smith, a consultant gynaecologist at the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, will lead the team.Before the trial starts, embryos will be created and frozen from the women’s eggs and the sperm of their partner. The women will then undergo six-hour procedures to receive wombs from donors who are declared brain dead but still have beating hearts.''Donor retrieval is a bigger operation than transplanting the uterus into the recipient,'' Dr. Smith said in a statement. ''We don't want to subject a live donor to that operation.''The women will then be placed on immunosuppressant drugs for 12 months before the embryos can be implanted to prevent the body from rejecting the donor womb. The babies will be delivered by caesarean section to avoid placing the stress and strain of labor on their new wombs.After six months, the women can choose to have another child or have the donor wombs removed.

      <title>NASA confirms evidence of liquid water on Mars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNASA has confirmed that there is liquid water flowing on Mars, which is a potential breakthrough in the quest to search for life beyond Earth.According to NASA scientists, liquid water runs down canyons and crater walls on Mars, leaving dark stains in the terrain. These stains, known as the recurring slope lineae  or RSL  occur when temperatures rise above -10 Fahrenheit. The stains disappear during the cold season.Scientists discovered perchlorate salts, which is crucial in keeping water in liquid form by lowering the freezing point of water on Mars’ surface by looking at infrared light waves reflected from the RSL. The result showed that the wavelengths are commonly associated with deliquescence, a process where salt absorbs water from the air, said Georgia Tech doctoral student Lujendra Ojha. Ojha first discovered the stains while still an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona in 2011.This is not the first time water was discovered on Mars. Earlier in 2015, NASA released evidence that showed half of the northern hemisphere of the planet was once covered in an ocean, reported the Guardian.It remains to be seen whether this discovery will prove that life exists on Mars. NASA researchers will now focus on where the water comes from, whether it be deliquescence, from melted frozen water during the summer, or caused by concentrated saline aquifers in the forms of saturated gritty rocks on the Mars’ surface.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe transition from summer to autumn is usually marked by cool breezes and leaves changing color, though officially, fall does not begin until the autumnal equinox. The Earth is split by the the equator into northern and southern hemispheres. According to National Geographic, the planet orbits the sun at an tilted angle of approximately 23.5-degrees, and it is this tilt that determines the seasons.When it’s winter in the north, that area is tilted away from the sun. When it’s summer, it’s tilted towards the sun. Because of this tilt, day and night times are not usually equal, except on the two annual equinox days, writes The Weather Network.According to the BBC, the autumnal equinox occurs every year, usually on September 22, 23, or 24. Equinox is latin for ‘equal night’, and marks the moment when the sun passes over the equator. In spring, this is known as the vernal equinox, while in fall, we know it as the autumnal equinox. On these days, daylight and nighttime are both 12 hours long. Since fall also signals harvest season, many festivals are celebrated around this time.

      <title>Eleven million cars affected by Volkswagen emissions test cheat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAutomobile manufacturer Volkswagen has admitted to cheating on emissions tests, which in turn has affected 11 million cars worldwide.Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency say Volkswagen has installed an algorithm in vehicles that switches the emissions-control on and off when one of their diesel-powered cars undergo emissions testing.Diesel engines are more durable, while diesel fuel is also cheaper and can have up to 30 percent more mileage in a gallon of fuel than petrol-powered vehicles. However, isel engines emit more nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which could result in smog formation, according to VOX Explained.According to VOX Explained, an independant group  International Council on Clean Transportation  joined forces with researchers from West Virginia University when they noticed varied emission rates during field-testing of two Volkswagen vehicles. Volkswagen admitted to tampering with the emissions test when the EPA reportedly threatened to not approve the 2016 line of diesel-powered vehicles.According to the EPA, the algorithm tracks steering wheel position, pedal movements and atmospheric pressure to determine whether the vehicle is in a lab for testing. Full emissions control will be turned on during testing and off during normal driving conditions to maximize engine performance.The cheat has resulted in vehicles emitting up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides than what is considered standard, the EPA said.Volkswagen may be fined up to US$18 billion for violating the Clean Air Act.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Virgin snake gives birth two years in a row in Missouri</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA captive yellow-bellied water snake at the Cape Girardeau Conservation Nature Center in Missouri has reproduced again this summer, Missouri Department of Conservation naturalist Jordi Brostoski said. The water snake, which has not been held with any other water snakes in the last eight years, also reproduced without a male counterpart in 2014.An intern of the center discovered the membranes in the snake’s cage and thought it was a joke someone played on him."I thought, ‘what joker put tomatoes in here for the snake’,” intern Kyle Morton said in a release, according to the Washington Post.The process of reproducing without a sperm donor is called parthenogenesis, where cells known as polar bodies behave like sperm and fertilize an animal’s egg. According to the conservation department, there have been no other documented cases of parthenogenesis by a yellow-bellied water snake, which usually give birth to live snakes rather than lay eggs.Scientists have contributed such phenomena to sperm that has been stored within the snake from when it was in the wild. However, stored sperm usually dies within a year, according to MDC herpetologist Jeff Briggler.Two of the offspring the snake gave birth to in 2014 survived, but none that were reproduced this year lived, Brostoski said. This type of virgin birth can be seen in some insects, fish, amphibians, birds and reptiles, including some snakes, but not mammals, according to Briggler."[The snake is] at that age where she's completely able to reproduce ... It seems like a reproductive survival technique," Brostoski said in a news release. "Without a male, she wants to go ahead and produce offspring. That's what she's driven to do."RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Study finds 96 percent of former NFL players had brain disease</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA study by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University found that 87 out of 91 former NFL players tested suffered from a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy.CTE is a brain disease that researchers believe us caused by repetitive head trauma. Brain scans can detect signs of CTE, but it can only be confirmed posthumously.The disease causes a protein called tau to form around blood vessels in the frontal lobe. During stage two, sufferers may experience rage, impulsivity, or depression. Symptoms of stage three include confusion and memory loss as the tau protein spreads to other parts of the brain. Stage four is marked by dementia, as nerve cells in the brain die. During the final stages of CTE, the brain withers to roughly half the size of a normal brain.A federal judge has approved a $1 billion settlement between the NFL and thousands of ex-players.

      <title>Rare supermoon lunar eclipse to dazzle later this month</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA supermoon lunar eclipse, a phenomenon which last occurred more than three decades ago, will be visible to people in the Americas on September 27 and visible to those in Western Europe and parts of Africa early on September 28.A lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, Earth and moon  align to form an exact or near-exact straight line, with the Earth in the middle. The technical term for this alignment is "syzygy", which in Greek means being paired together.  While in syzygy, the Earth casts its shadow on the moon's surface.The Earth's shadow is made of an outer part called the Penumbra, a darker, central part called the Umbra, and the Antumbra, an lighter area beyond the Umbra. On September 27, the lunar eclipse will be total, meaning the moon will completely enter the Umbra for one hour and 12 minutes.The moon will not turn completely dark, however. Rather, it will turn reddish, as if hit by sunlight bent by the Earth's atmosphere, a phenomenon known as a blood moon. At the same time, another phenomenon known as a perigee supermoon will also occur.At 252,000 miles from Earth, the moon will be at its apogee, its furthest point from Earth. At its perigee, its closest point to our planet, it is about 226,000 miles away. On September 27, the moon will be at perigee and will appear to be about 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than an apogee full moon. This rare supermoon total lunar eclipse, which has occurred only five times since 1900, will be 100 percent visible from start to end in some parts of North America, in all of South America, in Western Europe and western Africa. The event will not be visible in East Asia.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The moon reflecting the Sun rays 2. Sun, Earth, and moon aligned3. The Earth casting its shadow on the moon's surface4.

Rather, it will turn reddish as it is hit by sunlight bent by the Earth's atmosphere, a phenomenon known as a ‘blood moon.’”“At the same time, another phenomenon known as a ‘perigee supermoon’ will also occur.”“Supermoons happen because the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical rather than circular.” “When the moon is at its apogee, its furthest point from Earth, it’s about 252,000 miles away. “At its perigee, its closest point to our planet, the moon is about 226,000 miles away.”“On September 27, the moon will be at perigee and therefore it will appear to be about 14 percent larger and 30 brighter than an apogee full moon.”“An event like a supermoon total eclipse is quite unique. Since 1900 it has occurred only five times, in 1910, 1928, 1946, 1964 and 1982.

      <title>China plans to send the first spacecraft to land on moon&#x2019;s dark side</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twChina, which landed a probe on the moon in 2013, now plans to be the first country to land a probe on the moon’s far side by 2020.The far side of the moon, most of which is never visible from Earth, has been observed by various probes, but no one has ever attempted a landing.The Chinese mission will be conducted by the Chang’e-4 spacecraft. The Chang’e-4 is able to handle a larger payload than China’s previous lunar mission, the Chang’e 3, Zou Yongliao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' moon exploration department told China’s state-run CCTV.The Chang’e-4 will orbit the moon and look for the right spot to deploy its rover. After making a soft landing, the lunar rover will dig and collect rock samples from up to 2 meters below the surface.According to CNN, some security experts fear that China is looking to lay claim to the moon’s resources, which include water and Helium 3, a clean-burning fuel that could offer an alternative to nuclear power.The U.S. is also looking at the moon for resources, and NASA is working with private companies to find ways to mine the Earth’s satellite, CNBC News reported. Chang’e-3 landed on the moon in 2013 and released a rover called Jade Rabbit, which is still on the moon, making China the third country, after the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, to land a probe on lunar soil. Now other nations in the Asia are trying to match China’s achievements. Japan has announced it will land an unmanned rover on the moon by 2018.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The moon’s dark side2.

      <title>Massive neolithic ritual site with 90 megaliths discovered near Stonehenge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twIn what may prove to be the largest Neolithic site ever discovered in Britain, and possibly in Europe, archeologists have found a row of 90 megaliths near Stonehenge.The 4,500-year-old stones, which are up to 15 feet tall and five feet wide were found, thanks to the use of sophisticated ground-penetrating radar equipment, buried under a thick grassy bank. They were lying horizontally, three feet underground. It is conceivable that they originally stood vertically in the ground, like other standing stones in Britain, and that the stone line marked a ritual procession route in a gigantic ceremonial complex.Archaeologists believe the megaliths were ultimately deliberately pushed over and buried. Durrington Walls, the site where the stones were found, is 12 times the area of Stonehenge and was arranged with the same summer solstice alignment, the Telegraph reported. Another nearby wooden structure named Woodhenge was thought to represent the land of the living, while Stonehenge represented the realm of the dead.The research on this new discovery, which opens a new chapter of the Stonehenge story, will be presented at the British Science Festival in Bradford this week.Paul Garwood, an archaeologist and lead historian on the project at the University of Birmingham, was quoted by the Guardian as saying that the new discovery has changed fundamentally how researchers understand Stonehenge and the world around it.“Everything written previously about the Stonehenge landscape and the ancient monuments within it will need to be rewritten,” Garwood said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Why United States border walls might fail to prevent migration</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Ahead of the 2016 United States presidential election, a number of Republican hopefuls have again made US border protection a key issue and several have suggested that border walls are a key solution. The history of U.S. border protection, however, shows how unfeasible the idea of a bricks-and-mortar wall is. The construction of the so-called 2,000-mile-long “Border Wall” began in 1993 between San Diego and Tijuana. However, by 2006, only 14 miles of the fence had been completed at a cost of $39 million dollars. By 2011, 646 miles of the fence was scattered along the southwest border, with 299 miles of the existing wall made up of vehicles barriers built at an approximate cost of $1.7 million per mile and 350 miles of pedestrian fencing, built at an estimated cost of $6.5 million per mile. The project proved too expensive to finish.That same year, under the Obama administration, a virtual wall using mobile surveillance and unmanned drones covering the entire 2,000-mile border, was announced at a cost of over $7 billion. A pilot program with 53 miles of virtual surveillance was launched in Arizona. After $1 billion was spent, that project was also abandoned due to its inability to meet standards for viability and cost effectiveness.But the problem is not only financial. Physical walls have not deterred immigrants from making the trip across the border. Instead, the walls have caused a rise in migrant deaths as migrants still attempt the crossing, but in more remote and risky border areas. While doing little to prevent illegal immigration, walls create many environmental problems such as the erosion of mountains, the dumping of erosion waste into rivers and consequential flooding. A physical wall along the entire US-Mexico border is unrealistic and is not a viable solution to the United States’ immigration woes. And equally costly, virtual walls both eliminate some of the environmental issues with building a physical wall, but also invite new questions regarding the privacy rights of Americans as well as health concerns.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA 39-year-old woman has been granted a disability allowance by a court in Toulouse, France due to her apparent allergy to Wi-Fi.Marine Richard suffers from a condition known as electromagnetic hypersensitivity and says that exposure to mobile phones, Wi-Fi, televisions, microwaves and other gadgets causes her severe discomfort.Typical symptoms reported by those with the condition include headaches, fatigue, tingling, nausea and palpitations.Despite Richard’s claims, however, the World Health Organization has yet to find scientific studies proving the link between electromagnetic waves and the symptoms she says she’s been suffering. One highly-disputed recent study cited by Newser, however, did demonstrate such a link.Richard, a former radio producer, says she was forced to move to a remote barn without electricity in Ariège, in the French Pyrenees.Richard will now reportedly be receiving 800 euros a month in disability pay for three years following a decision handed down by a Toulouse court.In a similar case in the United States, a Massachusetts couple are asking for $250,000 in damages after their son’s school installed a wireless network, which they say caused the the 12-year-old headaches, chest pains, nosebleeds, nausea, dizziness, and rashes.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>NASA-funded study says cryogenic sleep may be key to space travel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA NASA-funded study written by aerospace engineering company SpaceWorks says that keeping astronauts unconscious during long flights in space cuts down on the equipment and resources needed on the shuttle, and also eliminates the negative psychological effects of long hauls in space.According to SpaceWorks’ study on cryogenic sleep, which borrowed ideas from doctors, a human body can be forced into a state of hibernation by simply lowering the body temperature to 93 degrees Fahrenheit. The lowered body temperature causes the body’s heart rate and metabolism to decrease, effectively placing it in a state of unconsciousness. The body will subsist on intravenous feeding tubes that pump the necessary lipids, amino acids and various nutrients into the body. Other tubes will drain urine as well as monitor the body.According to mockups, a torpor-statis habitat can hold six astronauts at once and robotic arms will ensure everyone’s basic needs are met. In their study, SpaceWorks says that they imagine the crew would wake up in a staggered pattern so that at least one person is awake at all times. So far humans are only able to maintain stasis for two weeks, although the trip from Earth to Mars is expected to take up to nine months.NASA has declined to fund the second stage of the research though and SpaceWorks, citing its potential therapeutic benefits, is now looking into using the technology here on Earth.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAmtrak is stepping up security measures on trains after an attack on a high-speed rail in France was foiled on August 21 and ahead of Pope Francis' visit to the United States next month.According to CBS News, Amtrak has a 500-officer police force, as well as New York Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) police and a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) program to assist with security on the Northeast Corridor. But many small train stations have little security, which means anyone could potentially run right up to a train and get on it without being stopped or asked questions.The most sensitive target at the moment seems to be the Northeast Corridor between New York and Washington, which will see an increase in ridership during the Pope’s visit next month. Homeland Security already deploys what are called VIPR teams along the Northeast Corridor, which include agents in uniform and bomb-sniffing dogs, as well as agents out uniform who blend in with passengers to detect any suspicious activity. Unlike at U.S. airports, mandatory full-body scan have not been introduced, but the VIPR program, which has a budget of more than $100 million, is expanding. In a statement published on its website, Amtrak said that “passengers failing to consent to security procedures will be denied access to trains.”Amtrak aimed at introducing such security measures at train stations already five years ago, but high costs and the complexity of the project prevented Amtrak from investing in it.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA new Pentagon report released on Thursday says that China’s reclamation efforts in the Spratly Islands has grown dramatically over the last few months, and at a rate far faster than earlier this year.Previous estimates that China has reclaimed 2,000 acres since December 2013 are wrong, the Pentagon report says, and the real amount is around 2,900 acres. According to the Pentagon, China has reclaimed more land in the past 20 months than  the other claimants combined over the past 40 years. China said in early August that it has halted its reclamation efforts in the island chain, although many countries question these claims.On Fiery Cross Reef, China has built an airstrip that the country could use as an alternative to an aircraft carrier. Reuters reports that the 3,000-metre-long runway will most likely be operational by the end of this year.At many of the reclamation sites in the Spratlys, China has also built channels and berthing areas for large ships.The new Pentagon report, titled “The Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy,” was required by Congress ahead of a 2015 defense bill.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Former US President Jimmy Carter to be treated for brain cancer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFormer U.S. president Jimmy Carter will treat his melanoma with pharmaceutical company Merck & CO’s Keytruda, a new treatment that stimulates a patient’s immune system so that it can fight cancer on its own, Reuters reported.Earlier this month, doctors removed about one tenth of Carter’s liver after he was diagnosed with a melanoma. The cancer, however, had already spread to his brain. To treat it, doctors have decided to use a new class of drug that works by boosting the body’s immune system.Our immune system works by recognizing invading bodies, such as viruses, using surface proteins on T-cells called receptors. These receptors interact with viruses like a lock and key. Once inside the T-cell, the virus is enveloped and destroyed.Cancer cells though, are able to evade T-cells by hiding from the receptors and are also able to suppress the receptors’ activity. Unlike viruses, cancer cells are not as easily destroyed and on the contrary they can multiply and spread to other tissues.The new drug works by removing the cancer cells’ blockade on T-cell receptors so that at that point it will be up to the patient’s own immune system to fight the cancer. T-cells would then be able envelope tumoral cells and destroy them. Pembrolizumab, which is sold under the brand name Keytruda, can cost as much as US $150,000 a year and, according to Dr. Anna Pavlick, co-director of the melanoma program at NYU Langone Medical Center's cancer center, only an estimated 40 percent of patients will respond positively to the treatment. Keytruda’s side-effects include fatigue and rash. Carter, who took his first infusion of the drug on Wednesday, said he only had a slight reaction and doctors think he will soon be able to resume many of his regular activities. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Smugglers would then use scuba diving suits and gear to retrieve the drug from under the water.Padilla-Zepeda, who had been living in Mexicali, says he was initially asked to help smuggle people across the border into the US, but was eventually forced to instead smuggle drugs.The smuggler pleaded guilty to charges of narcotics possession with the intention to distribute in San Diego’s federal court and could now face up to 20 years in prison.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>FDA approves Flibanserin, the &#x2018;female viagra&#x2019;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Food and Drug Administration has approved a libido-enhancing pill for premenopausal women whose lack of sexual desire causes distress, Reuters reported.Despite being dubbed the female viagra, unlike Viagra, which affects blood flow to the genitals, Flibanserin, works on the brain.According to Sprout Pharmaceuticals, the privately held startup that designed the drug, Flibanserin focuses on the brain's prefrontal cortex and enables sexual desire to manifest by rebalancing neurotransmitters that influence it.Specifically, flibanserin increases dopamine and norepinephrine, responsible for sexual excitement, and decreases serotonin, which is responsible for sexual satiety and inhibition. This is likely achieved by a reduction of glutamate transmission. Women who took the drug in a clinical study have shown an increase of about 1.0 more sexually satisfying events per month, Reuters reported. The pill needs to be taken every day and its most common side effects are dizziness, nausea and sleepiness.Advocates claim that the increase in sexually satisfying events is meaningful, while critics say the benefit is outweighed by the drug’s risks.Flibanserin will be sold under the brand name Addyi.As the drug could potentially cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting when taken with alcohol it will be sold exclusively through certified health care professionals and pharmacies.

      <title>Scientists predict this year&#x2019;s El Nino will be strongest on record</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twScientists at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center released a forecast on Thursday predicting that this year’s El Nino event could be one of the strongest ever.Conditions are ripe for the most powerful El Nino ever recorded as sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean are as much as 3.5 degrees fahrenheit above average. NOAA’s noted much of the ocean conditions they are seeing now are comparable to the ones they saw before the disastrous El Nino winters of 1982 -83 and 1997-98. During these periods, El Nino wreaked havoc across the western United States and in parts of South Asia, South America and East Africa. Weakened winds that usually blow warm waters in the eastern Pacific to Indonesia and Australia, as well as the unusually warm atmosphere that characterizes El Nino will shift a subtropical jet stream that usually travels through Latin America toward California and the southern states, causing the area to experience extreme rainfall. After the 1997 El Nino event, southern California got double its annual amount of rainfall while Los Angeles received a year’s worth of rainfall in one month alone.CNN reports that warmer waters will drive away coldwater fish in the eastern Pacific, a key component of many economies along the American coast.While increased rainfall in California may help counter the area’s four-year drought, scientists caution against thinking that the El Nino event will solve the state’s water issues. California needs 2.5 times its average rainfall to patch its current water deficit. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Warming waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean2. Atmospheric heating3.

      <title>Philae lander&#x2019;s touchdown error gives ESA unexpected data on Comet 67</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe European Space Agency’s Philae lander’s botched comet touchdown has produced a silver lining, as it has allowed the lander to take important measurements in two separate spots instead of one, the Los Angeles Times reported.  The Philae lander attempted to land on comet P67/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on November 12, in an area later named Agilkia, but its anchoring harpoons and retro-rockets failed, resulting in the lander bouncing off the comet and landing on another spot later named Abydos. Thanks to the bouncing trajectory data, researchers were able to analyze not one but two sites, and found that Agilkia is made of a softer surface layer of dust and ice, while the crust at Abydos is much harder.If Philae had landed in its intended spot at Agilkia, it would have been fried by the sun many months ago. In its current location however, it was able to restart and discover that the comet has daily temperature swings, from about minus 296 degrees to minus 226 degrees Fahrenheit, and that it is made up of 16 organic molecular species, four of which had never being found on comets. It also discovered that the comet’s surface contains radiation-caused formaldehyde polymer, which is considered an important discovery as many scientists believe that the chemical building blocks for life on Earth might have been delivered by a comet. The Rosetta mission team hasn’t heard from Philae for weeks since it sent messages upon waking up from hibernation. The team hopes more data will eventually be sent, but if not, they are content with the amount of information that was received so far.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Philae lander landing on Agilkia 2.

He believes that one of the doors would likely lead to a storeroom. The other door could lead to a room holding the remains of Queen Nefertiti, believed by some to be Tutankhamun’s mother.“I have been testing the evidence ever since, looking for indications that what I thought I was seeing was, in fact, not there ... but the more I looked, the more information I found that I seemed to be looking at something pretty real”, Reeves told the BBC.Finding the tomb of Queen Nefertiti would be a huge breakthrough for archaeologists.

      <title>US efforts to cut ozone levels hindered by Chinese pollution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA study published in Nature Geoscience claims the U.S.’ effort to cut ozone levels have gone to waste due to pollution arriving on the west coast from China. Observations of the phenomena were made using satellites coupled with computer models of how air-borne molecules travel in the lower atmosphere. According to the study, from 2005 to 2010, the US managed to cut ozone-producing nitrous oxide emissions by 20 percent by imposing strict standards for motor vehicles and industry. During the same period of time, however, China's growth pushed its own ozone levels up by about 7 percent.Half of the increase in China came from the ground up, while the other half descended from the stratosphere. Although the study says that some of that pollution may have been blown to China from India and other parts of Asia.In the same way that the dominant westerly winds blow China’s air pollution into the troposphere, straight across the Pacific Ocean, and into the United States, causing ozone levels to rise again. According to the study lead researcher Willem Verstraeten, of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, local and national efforts to fight pollution could have a limited impact if the problem is not also dealt at an international level. “Our atmosphere is global rather than local,” he was quoted by the Japan Times as saying.High levels of pollution can cause respiratory problems, damage to crops and climate change.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twMillions of plastic shade balls were poured into the Los Angeles Reservoir on Monday to help protect water quality and prevent evaporation.Hollow and weighted down with water, the balls will remain on the water’s surface and protect the water from dust, rain, birds and reduce algae growth. The balls will also block the water surface from the sun, preventing bromide and chlorine in the water from reacting and forming bromate, a known carcinogen. Less than $35 million was used to produce the shade balls, an amount much smaller than the estimated $300 million cost of covering the 175-acre facility."This is a blend of how engineering really meets common sense. We saved a lot of money, we did all the right things," said Los Angeles Department of Water and Power General Manager Marcie Edwards at a press conference.Los Angeles is the first city in the United States to use shade balls. Ninety-six million shade balls have been poured into several reservoirs in LA.

      <title>Dutch university aims to use solar panels as highway noise barriers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology is developing solar panels that could be used to accomplish goals beyond simply electricity generation, such as acting as noise barriers along highways, Popular Mechanics reports.A practical test using the new technology is being run along the Netherland’s A2 highway, one of the nation’s busiest, near the city of Den Bosch.Two sets of sound barriers with incorporated LSCs, or “luminescent solar concentrators”, will be placed alongside the highway until early summer of 2016, as a full year of testing is crucial in order to verify the durability and performance of the panels under all weather conditions.The LSCs can absorb sunlight by using transparent dyed plastic sheets, which then emit and direct concentrated radiation onto solar cells hidden inside the panels’ frames.The LSCs come in a variety of colors, making highways more visually appealing.The two noise barriers currently in use measure 4.5 meters high by 5 meters wide.If the panels manage to pass the testing process, a single kilometer of barriers is expected to be able to generate enough energy to power 50 households.

      <title>Lexus showed its hoverboard in action in Barcelona, Spain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twLexus has created a working hoverboard that uses liquid nitrogen and magnets to glide above a magnetic track. The hoverboard was formally unveiled on Tuesday in a 2-minute video posted on YouTube.Lexus engineers used a copper oxide superconductor as the main “engine” of the hoverboard. Liquid nitrogen is poured onto the copper oxide to make it superconductive. When the chilled superconductor is placed above the magnetic track, a phenomena called “flux pinning” traps the superconductor in space above the magnet, maintaining the hover height of the board.Lexus and its German engineering partner Evico installed hundreds of magnets at a skate park in Barcelona to convert it into a hoverboard track where Lexus debuted the hoverboard.The hoverboard was developed by engineers at Lexus’ Tokyo division and is the fourth project in the company’s “Amazing Motion” publicity campaign.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Amazon proposes delivery drone traffic control at NASA conference</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twU.S. online retailer Amazon on Tuesday called for new air traffic rules for commercial drone flights. The proposal was unveiled by Gur Kimchi, Amazon’s vice president in charge of the company’s fledgling drone delivery program, at a NASA-sponsored conference at the agency’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. The Ames Research Center is home to a NASA team charged with the development of an air-traffic system called Unmanned Aerial System Traffic Management. Amazon proposed that airspace be segregated between unmanned and manned aircraft. Unmanned aircraft, or drones, making local deliveries and moving slowly would be restricted to airspace under 200 feet. Airspace between 200 and 400 feet would be reserved for high-speed drones traveling long distances.  No aircraft would be able to fly between 400 and 500 feet, and only manned aircraft could fly above 500 feet. High-speed delivery drones would file a flight plan with a central computer and be required to maintain internet connectivity while in flight. High-speed delivery drones would also download a list of obstacles and airspace to avoid from the central computer. All high-speed delivery drones would have sensors to detect manned aircraft, birds and other unexpected obstacles that might enter the drone’s path of travel. The drone would give way to manned aircraft and automatically avoid other threats.Amazon’s proposal envisions a future with thousands of drones sharing the sky in a manner similar to automobile traffic on a highway. Amazon hopes its proposal will speed the FAA’s acceptance of the company's drone delivery model. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Cross section of airspace reserved for slow drones, fast drones and manned aircraft2.

      <title>Flaw in Android software may allow hackers access to phones with just a single text</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twSecurity firm Zimperium told NPR that a weakness in an Android-based software may allow hackers to affect 95 percent of Android phones with just a single text. According to Zimperium, hackers can take advantage of flaws in Android software Stagefright, a multimedia processing tool in Android devices. However, the firm discovered the bug in their lab and don’t believe hackers are using it just yet.Malware can be incorporated into a video file and sent to an individual’s Android phone. If the message is received via Google Hangouts, Stagefright will immediately process the video and release the malware whether the file was actually opened or not. Though, if an individual is using the standard messaging software they would need to open the text before the video is processed. The malware can take complete control over the phone and allow hackers to gain access to all of the information stored inside, including taking over the phone’s camera and microphone.Google has developed patches that can protect Android users and has reportedly sent them out, but it’s ultimately up to phone carriers and phone makers to push the updates through to individual phones. Old devices often stop receiving updates altogether and are therefore left vulnerable to hacks and new issues that crop up.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Percentage of Androids that may be affected2.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has successfully tested an experimental supersonic aircraft that emits a quieter sonic boom.The plane’s design reduces shockwaves typically created during supersonic flight, resulting in a quieter sonic boom, according to Popular Mechanics.In an experiment, the plane was dropped from a balloon at an altitude of 30 kilometers and reached supersonic speeds during free fall. The sonic boom data was collected via several aerial microphones attached to a blimp.However, according to Popular Mechanics, it is unclear how the Japanese plane accomplishes this.Sonic booms are created when shockwaves produced by an aircraft that has reached supersonic flight merge into a single sound.The plane, flight tested by Japanese space agency JAXA, and reportedly built to specifications conceived by Sweden’s Esrange Space Center, represents an attempt to rectify some of the issues faced by the world’s first supersonic commercial jet, the Concorde, which had its European routes cancelled due to noise levels.JAXA expects to release detailed data from the experiment in the near future.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twKepler-452b, a planet located 1,400 light-years away from Earth, was announced on Thursday as the most Earth-like planet ever found by NASA, which is naming it ‘Earth 2.0’.The exoplanet Kepler-452b orbits around a G-star similar to our sun every 385-days in the constellation Cygnus. It is five percent farther away from its sun than Earth is to our sun, but receives the same amount of sunshine, as its sun is 10 percent larger, NASA said in the press conference.NASA believes the exoplanet is five times more massive than Earth, with a rocky surface and a thicker atmosphere, while gravity would be about twice as strong on Kepler-452b than it is on Earth.This is the 1,030th planet confirmed by the Kepler Space Telescope, according to NASA.

      <title>Honda&#x2019;s robotic walking assistant aids people learning to walk again</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twHonda has announced that in November it will begin to lease a robotic device designed to help people learning to walk again after sustaining an injury.According to the company, the Honda Walking Assist Device has been undergoing development since 1999 and has already been trialled at roughly 50 hospitals and other facilities in Japan since 2013.The technology was carried out as part of the research and development of ASIMO, Honda’s advanced humanoid robot. It is based on the inverted pendulum model, which is a theory of bipedal walking. Two motors on the device helps people lift their legs at the thigh as the leg it moves forward and backward. This lengthens the user’s stride, allowing them to walk further and faster.Honda says that the motors and control system have also been designed to be ultra-light weight, while the belt design and size-adjustable frames make it more accessible to put on and take off for all patients.The technology comes with a variety of training modes, including follow mode, where the device follows the patients' walking patterns, and symmetric mode, where the device adjusts the user’s walking pattern to help them achieve more symmetry in their motions when they bend and extend both legs. The step mode alters the user’s steps repeatedly to enable them to shift their weight from heel to sole and sole to toe more smoothly.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. An elderly person having trouble walking2.

Elderly people walking with ease with the help of robotic walking assistantVOICEOVER (in English): Automobile manufacturer Honda has developed a robotic walking assistant device to help rehabilitate patients learning to walk again. The device can also aid the elderly and those with walking disabilities.When the device is attached around a person’s pelvis and thighs, a sensor measures the walking patterns of each user and submits data displayed visually on a tablet.The robotic walking assistant device weighs around 2.7 kilograms, and has a battery life that lasts about 60 minutes.In November 2015, the robotic walking assistant device will be available to medical institutions in Japan.The device is expected to improve users’ motor skills and increase the distance they can walk.SOURCES: http://www.honda.co.jp/news/2015/p150721.html?from=topbannerhttp://car.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20150722_712728.htmlhttp://www.sankei.com/economy/news/150721/ecn1507210042-n1.htmlhttp://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXLASDZ21HH1_R20C15A7TI5000/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20150721/k10010161361000.htmlhttp://japan.cnet.com/news/service/35067649/http://eandt.theiet.org/news/2015/jul/honda-walking.cfm***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>China plans to build new 130 million people megacity around Beijing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Chinese government is embarking on an ambitious project to merge several megacities with the capital Beijing and create a super metropolis capable of housing as many as 130 million people, according to the New York Times. The megalopolis, called Jing-Jin-Ji, would link Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, will be spread over 82,000 square miles, about six times the size of New York City, but with a population of as much as one third of the United States.The plan aims to revamp northern China’s economy, by moving parts of Beijing’s bureaucracy, factories and hospitals to the hinterland, while offering new services that are lacking in areas around Beijing such as bus terminals, schools, cinemas and parks.A subway and better light rail system are also under construction and will open in the next three to five years. A new bridge over the Chaobai River will connect to Beijing. With this new super city, the Chinese government aims to assign new economic rules to the cities: Beijing will focus on culture and technology, Tianjin will become a research base for manufacturing and Hebei will more likely focus on minor industries, such as textiles.The entire project, which has the support of President Xi Jinping, is likely to see a deep reconsideration of how taxes are collected and distributed within the territory, which would mean instituting property taxes and allowing local governments to keep them.“This is a huge project and is more complicated than roads and rail,” Wang Hu, a historian of Beijing’s development was quoted by the New York Times as saying. “But if it can succeed, it will change the face of northern China.”RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Giant earthquake predicted to hit Pacific Northwest of the United States</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAccording to peer review studies recently highlighted in a New Yorker article, a giant earthquake is expected to hit the Pacific Northwest along the Cascadia subduction zone and strike an area that’s currently ill-prepared to handle its consequences.The Cascadia subduction zone is a fault line that runs from Cape Mendocino in northern California to Vancouver Island, Canada. It sits next to Juan de Fuca, an oceanic plate that continuously pushes against the North American continental plate.When the Juan de Fuca plate slides under the North American plate, it will cause an earthquake of a magnitude between 8.7 and 9.2 on the Richter scale, which dwarfs any earthquake unleashed by the San Andreas fault line. When the oceanic plate slides under Canada and the U.S., the entire coastal area will sink at least six feet in less than five minutes.Experts predict that northern California and Oregon will receive the greatest impact from the massive quake. They also predict that the massive earthquake and the tsunami that follows it, will displace millions, obliterate the region’s economy, and the Pacific Northwest may end up going months without electricity or water afterwards.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

New Zealander Jimi Hunt, the co-founder of Live More Awesome charity, said that he had the slide constructed to raise awareness about depression and mental illness. The Guinness Book of World Records has recognized it as the longest in the world.It takes three days to fully set up the slide, which measures 1,975 feet long and uses about a thousand gallons of water per hour in order to facilitate sliding speeds reaching up to 40 miles per hour. It is made from the same PVC material that bouncy castles use. Up to 15 air blowers are used to keep it inflated.Initial test runs with park employees proved successful, but the slide still requires the state’s approval.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twExperts working at Birmingham University’s Department of Chemical Engineering say the best way to pack a dishwasher is in a circular pattern with cutlery in the center.Dishes used for protein-heavy foods should sit on the edges and be placed lower in the machine to allow enough time for chemical detergents to effectively work, the researchers said, while plates and dishes used for carbohydrate-based foods should be packed in the center of trays or on top shelves to be closer to water jet sprays that dislodge these food remnants.  Water in a dishwasher travels at a higher velocity towards the center of the machine and at a lower velocity along the edges. The slower-moving detergent-filled water breaks down proteins, while the faster-moving water swirling around the outside edges of the dishwasher helps break up and clean away carbohydrate-type foods.Media reported researchers also noted that rinsing dishes before washing them is unnecessary and simply scraping off excess food is sufficient.They also explained that that an overloaded dishwasher cannot properly clean dishes as there is not enough room between items to ensure dish surfaces come in contact with water and are cleaned properly.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

As the world has become increasingly connected to the Internet, more and more of the vital systems people use are Internet-reliant, and therefore potentially more vulnerable.Problems with the Internet are inevitable, and there’s always the potential for broken codes, human error and cyberattacks that mess with the system. Carl Wright, general manager of TrapX, a security company told the Los Angeles Times that a company could better protect their system by using two internet providers rather than one, with one serving as the backup.

The company could also increase their security budget and train employees on how to handle internet failures quickly.”SOURCES: http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-technical-problems-united-nyse-20150708-story.htmlhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-nyse-outage-may-not-matter-to-investors-1436374396http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/07/wall-street-journal-website-down-amid-nyse-united-210137.html***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Tokyo&#x2019;s Haneda Airport to begin using robots</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twIn September, the Tokyo city airport will lease 11 robots to help clean the facilities and carry passengers’ baggage, according to multiple reports. The robots look similar to wet-dry vacuums or motorized stools. Authorities say if the robots work well, more airports around the country may also begin to use them.“I want to expand it to all other airports in Japan, and also to airports worldwide,” Bloomberg quoted Japan Airport Terminal Co. President Isao Takashiro as saying. The airport operator leased the robots from Cyberdyne Inc., the two companies said in a statement released Thursday.Cyberdyne will also provide five exoskeletons designed to help workers in loading tasks. The company says the suits work by detecting electric signals from the wearer’s brain to help people move merchandise more easily.The announcement of robots in the airport comes after Japan’s Cabinet’s Tuesday approval of the government’s revamped Japan Revitalization Strategy, which includes support for robot research and development as one of the main areas of focus.As Japan’s workforce ages, robots are beginning to take over the work. According to Bloomberg, about 26 percent of Japan’s 127 million population are aged over 65. This is the highest percentage among the top seven industrialized nations.Haneda is the second-busiest airport in Asia and the fourth-busiest in the world, according to the International Air Transport Association.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Toshiba to use scorpion-like robot to enter Fukushima nuclear power plant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twToshiba is deploying a robot that looks like a scorpion to enter the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Japan. This comes amid the ongoing struggle to clean up the power plant following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan that caused a radiation leak and long-term evacuations.The cylinder-shaped machine was developed with the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID), and is designed to enter the primary containment vessel (PCV) of the Unit 2 reactor at the plant.The aim of the device is to help authorities determine the condition and location of melted-down fuel in the reactor, which is too dangerous for workers to enter.The robot is 54 centimetres long and is able to pull itself right-side up if it falls over. A joint near the middle of the robot allows it to raise its tail like a scorpion to allow a camera and LED lights to sweep the environment. This complements another camera and LED lights in the nose section of the robot.Control signals are sent to the robot through a wire by operators using devices resembling PlayStation game controllers. The 5-kilogram (11-pound) machine also has a thermometer and a dosimeter, and can withstand about 100 Sieverts per hour of radiation for 10 hours.The robot could be exposed to as much as 70 Sieverts per hour of radiation in the No. 2 reactor. This is about seven times that encountered by robots that ventured into the No. 1 reactor, according to a Toshiba spokeswoman.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Conditions inside Fukushima nuclear power plant2.

      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twOngoing geomagnetic storms have led to sightings of the Northern Lights across North America this week, the result of a coronal mass ejection from the Sun that occurred on Sunday, sending a stream of charged particles toward Earth.The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are caused by blasts of magnetic plasma from the Sun that react with the Earth’s own magnetic field. Some of the charged particles from the solar wind enter the Earth’s atmosphere and are drawn to the magnetic north pole and magnetic south pole.

      <title>Japanese carmakers expand recall of cars with Takata airbags</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twJapanese carmakers Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi are recalling more cars to replace airbags made by Takata, which have been linked to eight deaths and more than 100 injuries.Takata is at the center of a recall of tens of millions of cars around the world for potentially deadly air bag inflators that could deploy with too much force and spray metal fragments inside vehicles.The recalls initially were limited to North America but now how been expanded to cover the rest of the world.The faulty airbags are found in certain models made by Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.The inside of an airbag’s inflator assembly, which is located underneath the steering wheel, is filled with propellant granules and propellants. Unlike propellants made by most other brands, Takata-designed propellants are made from ammonium nitrate. If exposed to high humidity, the propellants can end up damaged or cracked, this causes them to produce too much pressure inside the inflator, causing it to crack and explode.When the airbag inflates, pieces of the damaged inflator may fly at the driver and passenger like shrapnel, putting people in a crash at greater risk of injury.

      <title>Russia touts new &#x2018;super tank&#x2019; T-14 Armata</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twRussia’s fifth-generation main battle tank is so advanced its designers are telling Western media outlets that operating it is like “playing a computer game.”The T-14 Armata tank, which features an automated gun turret and a new type of reactive armor, was shown off by Russia during its May 9 Victory Parade in Moscow celebrating the 70th anniversary of the fall of Nazi Germany.Ilya Demchenko, deputy chief designer, told Sky News: “A new philosophy of these machines is that they have a remote controlled combat module, multi-spectre channels, new algorithms and, if I may draw an example, it's as if the crew, roughly speaking, plays a computer game.According to reports in Jane’s Defence and RT, the T-14 will be faster than America’s Abrams tank and will enter service next year. The new tank features a 125 mm smooth-bore cannon that fires missiles as well as shells, a remote-controlled machine gun and an advanced armor package along three-quarters of its length. For increased survivability, its three crew will be protected by a multilayer armor capsule that is separate from the ammunition container. This marks a departure from Soviet-era main battle tank designs, where crew safety, or “survivability,” did not appear to be a primary concern. The T-14 will replace Russia’s T-72 and T-90 main battle tanks. Russia plans for more than 2,300 Armatas to enter service with its military over the next 15 years. The official cost of the new tank has not been disclosed, but observers say it may cost as much as a fighter jet. The acquisition of 2,300 Armatas is part of a 22 trillion rouble ($400 billion) programme to upgrade Russia’s military that also includes hundreds of new aircraft and missiles and dozens of new navy ships.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Skinny jeans sends an Australian woman to the hospital</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twDoctors are warning of the dangers associated with wearing tight jeans after a 35-year-old ‘fashion victim’ in Australia had to be hospitalized for several days with severe numbness in her legs after spending hours squatting to clean out cupboards while wearing skinny jeans.Medical professionals say that skinny jeans can cause a condition called ‘compartment syndrome,’ where swollen muscles can end up severely damaging nerves in the leg.The squatting position, together with tight jeans, caused the woman’s muscles to swell, constricting the blood vessels and causing decreased blood supply to the legs. Looser pants would have allowed the muscles to expand to the side and relieve pressure on the blood vessels inside.The combination of swollen muscles and skinny jeans also placed pressure on two important nerves in the calf - the common peroneal nerve and the tibial nerve. This crushed the nerves and brought about a loss of feeling in the woman’s calves and feet.As the woman walked home that evening, she found that she couldn’t move her legs and feet properly and collapsed on the road.Doctors studied the woman’s nerves after she was hospitalized and found that there were blockages in her leg nerves.

      <title>Amsterdam to get world&#x2019;s first 3D-printed bridge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twDutch startup company MX3D has announced plans to build the world’s first 3-D printed bridge across an Amsterdam canal. The company hopes the technique could become standard on future construction projects.The company has invented robotic printers that weld steel structures using 3-D technology. The process involves robotic arm printers “walking” across the canal as it slides along the bridge’s edges, allowing the structure that has already been printed to support the weight of the robots.The robotic arms work by heating metal to 1,500 degrees Celsius (around 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit) and welding the structure drop-by-drop, according to MX3D.

      <title>New technology would make houses hover during earthquakes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twGreg Henderson, the co-founder and CEO of Arx Pax, says electromagnetic hoverboard technology may be the future of earthquake-proofed homes.Most earthquake-proofing systems decouple buildings from the ground using “base isolation bearings” so that they can move freely without compromising the building’s integrity.Henderson’s new system would rely on an electromagnet to produce repulsive magnetic force and generate lift.The house would be linked to the U.S. Geological Survey’s ShakeAlert system, allowing it to retract landing gears, activate the electromagnet and hover for up to 90 seconds when an earthquake is detected.The ShakeAlert system, which relies on a series of sensors placed near fault lines, has already proven effective in giving residents of earthquake-prone areas a head-start on incoming quakes.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Deadly bacteria found in Gulf of Mexico is Florida causing beach-goers concern</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA deadly bacteria present in the Gulf of Mexico is causing concern for Florida beachgoers.The bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus, is from the same family as cholera and is most commonly found in warm coastal waters. It requires high concentrations of salt to survive.According to the Florida Department of Health, infections are rare in healthy people. The bacteria normally infects people who enter coastal waters with an open wound or through consumption of undercooked or raw oysters.Contrary to some reports, the bacteria doesn’t eat flesh, but it is still deadly under certain circumstances, writes CNN.If the bacteria enters the bloodstream, it can then damage the skin and in 50 percent of such cases is fatal, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Oysters feed by filtering water, where they extract food particles, and sometimes the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria, which then concentrates on the oyster tissue. If an infected oyster is eaten undercooked or raw, the bacteria can enter the individual’s digestive tract and multiply rapidly.Vibrio vulnificus has infected 214 people and killed 66 since 2008, according to the Florida Department of Health.

A signal from Philae was picked up on Saturday night and continued for 85 seconds, the Telegraph reported.“It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment,” the Telegraph quoted European Space Agency scientist Mark McCaughrean as saying.The mission was due to end in September but the European Space Agency said it would likely run to 2016, the Telegraph reported.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.tw A shark expert posted a video to his Facebook page that shows him exiting his shark cage to give an enormous great white shark a high five. Mauricio Hoyos Padilla, who works at environmental conservation organization Pelagios Kakunja, shared the video on Tuesday. The video has since been removed from his page, but it has received more than 3 million views. The Discovery Channel featured the great white shark during its 2014 Shark Week program. In the Discovery Channel’s video, the team refers to the female shark as Deep Blue. The shark is at least 20 feet long, which is about the limit for a full-grown female, according to National Geographic. Deep Blue was pregnant at the time of filming, the Discovery team said, and “likely to be hungry.” Deep Blue has scars on her left side, which may have come from fights with other sharks or mating, according to Discovery. Discovery found Deep Blue off the coast of Guadalupe Island in Mexico. Padilla, who hails from Mexico City and lives in La Paz, said it was the first time he had seen the shark. The team estimated the shark to be about 50 years old. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Shark approaching diver’s cage 2. Line measuring length of shark’s body 3.

      <title>US EPA moves toward regulating aircraft emissions</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a draft scientific finding on Wednesday on how aircraft emissions contribute to climate change. The findings serve as the foundation for the EPA’s proposal to begin regulating aircraft emissions.The EPA’s findings, the so-called “endangerment finding,” is a precursor to the EPA’s proposal to curb emissions from commercial aircraft. The EPA plans to partner with the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization and develop worldwide carbon dioxide standards for planes. The United Nations is scheduled to release its proposed emissions standards by February 2016. Commercial aircraft contribute 11 percent of emissions in the U.S. transportation sector, and make up three percent of total U.S. emissions. While car emissions are already regulated in the U.S., and power plant emissions will be soon come under the Clean Power Plan, the airline industry still goes largely unchecked.The UN and the EPA’s carbon dioxide standards are expected to apply only to new aircraft designs certified from 2020 onwards, leaving the majority of the world’s aircraft unregulated. The EPA also excluded military aircraft or small planes such as turboprops from its proposal.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The EPA regulates car and power plant emissions but not plane emissions2.

      <title>Australian man rare blood type saves 2 million babies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAustralian man James Harrison is known as ‘The Man with the Golden Arm’ after his blood was used to develop an injection that has since saved the lives of an estimated two million babies from rhesus disease.Harrison, now aged 78, is from Australia’s central coast. He has been donating his blood plasma on a weekly basis for the past 60 years, CNN reported.“In 1951, I had a chest operation where they removed a lung  and I was 14. When I came out of the operation, or a couple days after, my father was explaining what had happened. He said I had (received) 13 units (liters) of blood and my life had been saved by unknown people. He was a donor himself, so I said when I’m old enough, I’ll become a blood donor,” CNN quoted Harrison as saying.Harrison has an unusual antibody in his blood, which was used to develop an injection called Anti-D, a medicine used to prevent rhesus disease. Rhesus disease is caused by an incompatibility that happens when a pregnant woman has rhesus-negative blood and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood. The mother’s body produces antibodies that destroy the baby’s red blood cells during pregnancy. This process is known as sensitization.The injection prevents women with rhesus-negative blood from developing antibodies to attack the baby’s red blood cells during pregnancy.“His blood is actually used to make a life-saving medication, given to moms whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. Every batch of Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has come from James’ blood,” Jemma Falkenmire of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service told CNN.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Home batteries from Tesla and Mercedes-Benz help spread distributed power generation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNew large-capacity batteries for home use from companies such as Tesla and Mercedes-Benz are increasing the viability of renewable energy for distributed generation. Solar energy is gaining popularity, with several U.S. states providing large subsidies to homeowners who install solar panels, but so far integrating it into the power grid has been a problem. Most energy still comes from centralized power plants, with home-generated solar energy being used or sold to the grid as it is produced. No solar energy is produced at night.  During the hot summer months, power utilities produce more energy and charge more during peak hours in the middle of the day. Other than fuel, the utilities’ main expenses are from maintaining the grid itself.With a home battery, homes with solar panels can save their own power during the day, and homes without solar panels can store cheap power from off-peak hours at night. Unused energy stored in the batteries can be sold back to the grid during peak hours. If home renewable energy generation and home battery storage became widespread, power plants could reduce their excess generation capacity. Power utilities would primarily be in the business of maintaining the grid, and the flow of energy from utility to customer would no longer be a one-way street. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Home solar only working during daylight 2. Power plant burning coal at peak time3. Houses use peak power for air conditioning in summer4. Utilities responsible for maintaining grid5.

When batteries and solar panels are ubiquitous, power plant burns less coal9. Utility still responsible for maintaining grid10. Less coal required, energy market now a two way streetVOICEOVER (in English): “Solar energy is increasing in popularity, but so far integrating it into the power grid has been a problem.

      <title>Britain approves world&#x2019;s first tidal lagoon power project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twBritain has given the go ahead for a 1 billion pound tidal power plant in Wales' Swansea Bay, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said on Tuesday. The project, developed by Tidal Lagoon Power, is expected to generate enough electricity to power around 155,000 homes. The project will create a 750-meter-long lagoon-shaped seawall in Swansea Bay and use the difference in water levels between the sea and the water inside the lagoon. Up to 26 low-head bulb turbines will be installed inside concrete turbine housings that are permanently submerged. Each turbine is equipped with sluice gates that will remain closed until the water level on either side is high enough to pass through and generate electricity. Hence, the process can be operated on flood tides as well as ebb tides. Developers say that this is the first step towards producing 10 percent of UK’s energy from tides. According to Bloomberg Business, Tidal Lagoon Power has started planning a second project: a second tidal power plant that can generate enough electricity for every home in Wales. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Layers of rocks will be added on top to protect the wall from degradation.”“Concrete turbine housings will hold up to 26 low-head bulb turbines that are permanently submerged. Each turbine can generate up to 16 megawatts per hour.”“The turbines’ sluice gates will be closed until the water level outside the lagoon is high enough. It will then open to let the water flows into the lagoon through the turbines to generating electricity.”“This process then occurs in reverse on the ebb tide.” SOURCES: IEEE Spectrum, Wales Online, This is South Wales, Reuters, Sky News, Bloomberg Businesshttp://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/geothermal-and-tidal/tidal-power-makes-a-surprising-comebackhttp://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/business/business-news/tidal-lagoon-power-signed-mou-4035952http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/Swansea-Bay-tidal-lagoon-report-works-access/story-19307111-detail/story.html#axzz2WlX2gq2yhttp://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/09/uk-britain-wavepower-lagoon-idUKKBN0OP1VW20150609http://news.sky.com/story/1499090/uk-to-get-underwater-power-stationhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-09/u-k-tidal-lagoon-project-in-swansea-wins-planning-permission***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Drone that can fly forever patented by Boeing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twBoeing obtained a patent for a drone and related charging system on June 2 that would allow the aircraft to remain aloft indefinitely. Titled “Autonomous aircraft with disconnectable tether,” Boeing’s patent describes a lighter-than-air craft that connects to charging towers. The design would reduce the system’s footprint from the long airstrip required by fixed wing drones down to the area of a charging tower, which could be situated in populated areas the way communications towers are.Boeing’s patent describes a buoyant aircraft that can navigate to a ground-based power supply, then lower a tether that latches onto the power supply. The craft’s control system can then order the tether to disengage after charging is complete. The power supply end of the system could be attached to a land-based tower, a high-altitude tethered balloon, a ship at sea or a terrestrial vehicle. The drone would lower its own tether down to the power supply, similar to the probe-and-drogue system used by planes for air-to-air refueling. Drones using this charging technology could find applications in parcel delivery, surveillance or other tasks where landing frequently would be impractical. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The patent describes a lighter than air craft, which charges via tether while remaining aloft.” “When the drone receives a signal, it detaches from the charging tether and changes location. The drones could also be charged via a ship, a moving land vehicle, or a high-altitude balloon.” “The system address two drawbacks of traditional drones. Fixed-wing drones require a runway to take off and must return to base to recharge. Vertical-takeoff drones have limited range and cumbersome landing gear.” “The floating drones could provide persistent monitoring of an area or rapid delivery service without needing to land.” SOURCES: Geekwire, U.S. Patent Office,http://www.geekwire.com/2015/new-patent-shows-how-boeing-plans-to-recharge-drones-in-mid-air/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9045218.PN.&OS=PN/9045218&RS=PN/9045218***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Israel tests &#x2018;dirty bombs&#x2019; in the Negev Desert</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Israel carried out a four-year series of tests on nuclear explosives to measure the effects were “hostile forces” ever to use them against Israel, Israel’s Haaretz daily newspaper reported Monday.Between 2010 and 2014, Israel conducted tests on “dirty bombs” in the Negev Desert. The project, supervised by staff from Israel’s Dimona nuclear facility, included 20 detonations mostly in the desert and involved between 250 grams and 25 kilograms of explosives. “Dirty bombs” combine radioactive material with conventional explosives such as dynamite and are usually detonated using a battery. After the explosives were detonated, mini-drones were used to measure the radiation levels of the explosions. The tests found high-level radiation near the center of the blasts, while low-level particles further from the blast center weren’t found to pose any danger.Israel began conducting drills on how to respond to a radioactive attack after Al-Qaeda started threatening to use ‘dirty bombs’ on the U.S. following the 9/11 attacks.

      <title>Multiple toxic air claims lodged against British airlines companies</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twSeventeen former and current flight crew are planning to sue British airlines for contaminated cabin air, the BBC reports. Workers believe they all fell ill after breathing in fumes that was mixed with engine oil and other toxic chemicals in the air circulating through aircraft.The cases are funded by the Unite union, which represents 20,000 flight staff.However, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says incidents of smoke or fumes on planes are rare and there is no evidence of there being a high enough concentration of contaminants to cause health problems or even long-term health effects.The Unite union is calling for a public inquiry into contaminated cabin air, according to the BBC. The union has even opened a dedicated legal unit to record and process claims from its membership.Uncensored safety reports submitted to the CAA, and obtained by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, show that between April 2014 and May 2015 there were 251 separate incidents of fumes or smoke inside a large passenger jet operated by a British airline.A version released by the BBC does not include cases which could be blamed on an internal fault, such as a broken toilet or air conditioning system. The statistics also do not include incidents on international airlines, even when planes are travelling through British airspace.The BBC reports that around around half the air on board most modern commercial jets is pumped into the aircraft through the engines. Those who claim cabin air toxic say when there is a problem with the engine seals, a mix of potentially poisonous gases can reach the cabin. Among these toxic gasses includes TCP, an organophosphate known to be dangerous to human health if there are high enough quantities in the air.Some cabin crew believe it is exposure to such toxins that over a long period of time that has damaged their long-term health. The problems also reportedly affect the central nervous system and brain.However, the CAA insists there is no evidence to support the claim that there are chemicals at high enough concentrations to cause bodily harm. Meanwhile, in 2013, an independent group of scientists  the Committee on Toxicity  could not establish a link between contaminated cabin air and ill health. Instead, the committee reported that an explanation for crew falling ill could be the "nocebo" effect, which is a psychological condition where exposure to even a harmless substance can lead to nausea, fatigue and other medical symptoms.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Chinese doctor transplants mice heads, plans trials with monkeys</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA Chinese doctor who has performed hundreds of head transplants on mice says he plans to perform the procedure on monkeys.Ren Xiaoping, who left a position at the University of Cincinnati to continue his research in China, first transplanted the head of a mouse on to the body of another in 2013. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, he has performed about 1,000 such procedures since then. Ren uses a diamond-bladed knife to create a cut that cleanly separates the recipient’s head from its body. Next, the donor animal’s head is separated at the midbrain to preserve the brainstem so that the heart continues to beat and lungs continue to breathe. Blood vessels are then connected using silicone tubes so that oxygen-rich blood from the donor body can reach the recipient’s head as quickly as possible, after which spinal cord nerves from the recipient’s head and the donor body are fused together using polyethylene glycol, or PEG.The recipient head is then affixed to the donor body with pins, wires and screws before the silicon tubes are removed and blood vessels muscles and skin are joined using tiny stitches. The mice have lived for as long as a day, a record Ren is hoping to improve on. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Ren hopes to to transplant the head of a monkey in 2015.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. A mouse is shown having its head severed in preparation for transplant2.

After performing an MRI scan at the National Children’s Hospital in Lima, doctors found out that a three-centimetre long larva was taking residence inside his eye, according to International Business Times.“The location of the worm from the lower lid, which was getting bigger, made the risks increase because the youth's tissue was swelling in an area close to the sinuses that's close to the delicate part which is the triangle of death,” International Business Times quoted ophthalmologist Carolina Marchena as saying.Doctors tried to remove it by luring it out with a piece of basil leaf before removing the rest using tweezers.

      <title>Ocean cleaning technology to make 2016 debut near Japan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA self-sustaining system designed to rid the world’s oceans of millions of tonnes of floating plastic garbage is set to make its debut next year off the coast of Japan.The Ocean Array Platform, brainchild of 20-year old Dutch inventor Boyan Slat, is designed to collect plastic trash that currently floats on or near the water’s surface.The one-mile wide array features two large booms on either side which use ocean currents to direct the plastic toward a central receptacle. The trash is then filtered into a large trash receptor on the back of the floating platform for recycling.With solar panels and water-generated turbines below the ocean surface, the platform is completely self sustaining.The array will be installed near the Japanese island of Tsushima in 2016 as part of a two-year long trial.Should the trial prove successful the project will be gradually expanded, with the ultimate aim to deploy a 62-mile-long array to capture around half of the trash in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a huge area of floating marine plastic and trash located between Hawaii and California.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Combination of cancer drugs can shrink tumor size by up to a third, research suggests</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twTwo immunotherapy drugs when used together can shrink cancerous tumours by up to a third in some patients, a new British trial suggests.Combining two cancer drugs, ipilimumab and nivolumab, shrank cancerous tumors by a third in 58 percent of cases in a 945-patient medical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine.The immune system has brakes in place to stop it from attacking the body’s own tissue. Cancer uses these brakes to evade detection. The drugs used in the trial, ipilimumab and nivolumab, remove these brakes, helping the immune system deal with the cancer, according to the BBC.Response to the combined treatment varied among those patients trialled, with many reacting well, and others not seeing any benefit.Experts warned that combining the two treatments can cause severe side effects such as diarrhea and fatigue, as well as elevated liver enzymes and other symptoms.According to Bloomberg, the combined treatment would have an annual cost of more than $250,000 at current rates.It is hoped that the immunotherapies will lead to more effective cancer treatment in the future.The British-led trial was conducted by researchers from the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, South West Wales Cancer Institute and several other international institutions. The research was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the company that manufactures the drugs being tested.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. T-cells destroying infected cells.2. Cancerous cell avoiding detection from t-cells.3. PD-L1 and PD-1 “secret handshake”4. Nivolumab disrupting "secret handshake"5. Ipilimumab and CTLA-4.6.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNASA is testing a new stationary lander called InSight for a planned mission to Mars in March 2016.The lander, which is equipped with two gallium arsenide solar array panels, will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and land on Mars about six months later.The InSight will not rove around Mars. Instead, it will act as a stationary driller, offering NASA for the first time in-depth analysis of Mars’ underground layers.Before the mission, InSight must pass tests to show it can endure extreme temperatures and near zero air pressure. Other tests include vibration testing meant to simulate launch conditions and checking for electronic interference between different parts of the spacecraft. According to NASA, examining Mars’ deep interior could reveal how all rocky planets, including Earth, have formed and evolved.The InSight is one of several missions NASA has planned as a prelude to the eventual goal of sending astronauts to the red planet by the 2030s.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

The two multifunctional lighthouses are planned for Cuarteron Reef and Johnson South Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands.Beijing has also recently said that it has the right to establish an Air Defense Identification Zone over the South China Sea.“This is a cause for concern because China acts like there’s an ADIZ although there has been no formal declaration,” Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said in a televised press conference in Manilla reported by Bloomberg.According to the Straits Times, the Philippines has defied China’s warnings by declaring that it will continue to fly military and commercial planes over the disputed area.China has recently been challenging not only flights by the Philippines but also by the United States over disputed islands in the South China Sea. Last week, the Chinese navy warned an American P8-A Poseidon surveillance plane eight times to fly away from the area. Washington has expressed concerns that China may at some point declare an exclusion zone in that could limit free movement of both aircrafts and ships in the area.China’s lighthouse project, along with the recent warnings to the U.S. and Philippines, is likely escalate tensions in a region where China aggressively claims territory that is also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Honeybee colony collapse tackled in new White House environmental strategy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Obama administration has unveiled a strategy intended to stop beehive colony collapse, after 40 percent of commercial honeybee colonies in the United States died off last winter.The White House’s plan, which was unveiled on Tuesday and is to be carried out by the USDA and EPA, includes devoting 7 million acres of federal land to pollinator habitat, reducing annual honeybee deaths to 15 percent by 2025 and returning monarch butterfly numbers from 30 million to 220 million in five years. The plan also calls for more studies of the class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, also known as “neonics”. Research now indicates neonics may also weaken bees’ immune systems. Weaker bees are more easily killed by invasive varroa mites and poor nutrition stemming from monocultural farming practices in the U.S.  Critics of the plan say it focuses too narrowly on commercial honeybees, only one of species 4,000 of bees in North America, and that there is no specific action plan to increase monarch butterfly numbers. Some insist neonic pesticides should be banned immediately, as they have been in the European Union. Neonic defenders point out that Australia uses the pesticides yet has avoided widespread colony collapse. Some suggest Australia’s immunity may be due to the absence of invasive varroa mites in the country. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Bee on watermelon flower2.

China has already begun construction of airfields and artificial islands in the South China Sea.The B-1 Lancer bomber, commonly called "Bone" (originally from "B-One") was first deployed by the US Air Force in the mid 1980s, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The aircraft is expected to continue in serve as a strategic bomber until the mid 2030s.The aircraft is able to rapidly deliver 84 500-pound bombs and is currently being used to attack Islamic State in Iraq, ABC News in Australia reported.Shear also said U.S. military movements will also be taking place in other countries in the region, including the “deployment of Global Hawks and F-35s in Japan.” Washington will be adding to the stock of V-22s in Japan, according to Shear.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>LightSail solar spacecraft to be launched soon</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe construction of the LightSail spacecraft, a solar spacecraft designed by the Planetary Society, will start next year thanks to a crowdfunded campaign that reached it’s goal in only one day, CBS News reported.On Wednesday afternoon, the private, non-profit Planetary Society and its CEO Bill Nye, managed to raise US$200,000, only a day after the campaign was launched. The money raised so far for the project will cover construction of the first spacecraft to be launched in 2016. However, the entire project is expected to cost $5.46 million.The LightSail is a spacecraft with solar sails which mirrored surfaces are designed to capture momentum, or photons, from solar energy. The constant barrage of solar energy generates continuous acceleration which eventually allows the spacecraft to reach high speed without burning any fuel.The spacecraft is also equipped with cameras which every seven seconds take photographs of the mylar sails deployment.The Planetary Society was co-founded by astronomer Carl Sagan. The organization tried to launch Cosmos 1, the first solar sail in the world, in 2005 but the craft never reached the orbit due to a failure of the launch vehicle.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twHackers are stealing money from the credit cards, bank and PayPal accounts of Starbucks customers by hacking into their Starbucks mobile apps. The Starbucks app allows customers to make purchases at Starbucks with their phones, check their Starbucks Card balances, transfer funds to their Starbucks Cards and transfer funds between cards, according the app’s description on iTunes.Hackers have discovered that apps such as these that store consumers’ credit card numbers and other personal information are easier to steal money from than financial institutions. They can drain money from the Starbucks app by siphoning off funds from Starbucks Cards, transferring funds to Starbucks Cards or creating new Starbucks Cards, and repeating the process. By enabling the app’s auto-reload function to drain funds, hackers can steal hundreds of dollars in a matter of minutes.The story was first reported by consumer journalist Bob Sullivan.Starbucks told CNN Money that the company does not believe its app was hacked and said that the incidents are more likely due to weak passwords. Starbucks suggests that its customers use unique passwords to prevent hackers from hacking into the app.However, enabling two-step authentication  a common feature which the Starbucks app lacks that sends a text message to your phone whenever you sign in from an unfamiliar device  would have better protected Starbucks customers.Starbucks has yet to decide whether it will add new security measures such as two-step authentication to its system. In the meantime, customers can protect themselves by creating strong passwords and by not saving their financial information in their Starbucks app accounts.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twToyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. have issued a global recall of millions of vehicles over problems with their airbags, which are designed by Japanese supplier Takata Corps.Toyota said on Wednesday that it is recalling around 5 million vehicles globally due to of airbag problems. The recall will affect 35 Toyota models globally. Nissan has recalled another 1.56 million vehicles globally for the same airbag problems. The inside of an airbag’s inflator assembly, which is located underneath the steering wheel, is filled with propellant granules and propellants. Unlike propellants made by most other brands, Takata-designed propellants are made from ammonium nitrate. If exposed to high humidity, the propellants can end up damaged or cracked, this causes them to produce too much pressure inside the inflator, causing it to crack and explode.When the airbag inflates, pieces of the damaged inflator may fly at the driver and passenger like shrapnel, putting people in a crash at greater risk in injury.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Australian agency reports an El Nino has formed</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA major El Niño event has been officially declared by Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BoM).The bureau reports the weather system is likely to lead to prolonged drier, hotter conditions across much of the eastern portion of the country.According to the Bureau, an El Niño occurs when sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become markedly warmer than average. This causes a shift in atmospheric circulation. The impacts of this will most likely be felt through autumn of 2016.Normally, trade winds blowing from east to west across the equatorial Pacific send warm surface waters to the eastern Pacific, generating a low-pressure area over which storms form. El Niño occurs when the winds reverse for periods as long as several months, causing warm water to spread over the central and eastern Pacific. This reorganises rainfall and atmospheric circulation bringing unseasonal and intense weather which can cause bushfires in Australia and flooding in South America.The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) says there is a 50-60% chance that the 2015 El Niño will continue through spring. El Niño will likely provide some rainfall relief to drought-stricken California but it’s not expected to have drastic global effects.El Niño tends to increase precipitation along U.S. coastlines, but the Midwest and Northwest tend to see a decrease from the average. The frequency of precipitation tends to increase in comparison to average frequency. El Niño also tends to suppress hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean by causing higher wind shear which spreads storms out over a larger area.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Underwood told WATE. SelectaDNA, the distributor of the device, has already set up similar security systems in 30 countries around the world, according to the company’s website. The system comes with warning signs and an alarm. But if a robber still manages to steal from the store, the security device sprays him or her with an odorless and colorless DNA mist. The DNA markings stick to the thief’s clothing fibers and skin cracks and are only visible under a UV light. Even if a criminal is stopped 7 weeks after the crime, an officer can still spot the DNA markings. Every system has a unique DNA code, so the robber can be traced back to a specific location.

      <title>The science behind Kylie Jenner&#x2019;s plump lips</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twKylie Jenner, the youngest “Keeping up with the Kardashians” star, admitted to using lip fillers, after insisting for months her plump lips were all natural.“It’s just an insecurity of mine, and it’s what I wanted to do,” the 17-year-old said during a sneak peek of an upcoming episode.Jenner admitted to using temporary lip augmentation, which likely means a medical professional numbed her lips and then injected a hyaluronic acid. There are several types of hyaluronic acids, but they all work by essentially adding moisture and cushioning to the skin.Hyaluronic acid -- which does not strip the skin the way most acids do -- is a naturally-occurring polysaccharide in the eyes, joints and in between the skin cells, according to a feature by Beauty Editor. It acts as a smoothing agent for skin, and as humans age, our bodies produce less and less of it.Injection results typically last between six and nine months before a patient needs another lip augmentation, New York City plastic surgeon Dr. Matthew Schulman told People.Side effects can include bruising, scarring and infections. But the procedure seems to be safer than the Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge.“I don’t think there’s a safety concern,” Schulman said of Jenner’s lip filler treatment. “I think the bigger concern with her being 17 is more of a psychological concern: whether she’s old enough or mature enough to undergo body transformation.” The next “Kardashians” episode airs Sunday at 9 EST on E!. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.A syringe injecting fluid into a person’s top lip2.Fluid filling the lip3.Hyaluronic acid compounds moving around in the lips4.Highlights showing naturally-occurring acid in eyes, joints and space between cells 5.Lips shrinking over 6-month period 6.Red highlights showing potential injury around lips "Kylie Jenner admitted to using temporary lip augmentation -- which likely means a medical professional numbed her lips and then injected a hyaluronic acid." "Hyaluronic acid works by essentially adding moisture and cushioning to the skin.""It’s a naturally-occurring carbohydrate in our eyes… joints… and the spaces between our skin cells."

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twChewing too much gum may have played a role in the sudden death of a Samantha Jenkins, 19, in Wales in June of 2011.Jenkins was feeling ill in the weeks leading up to her death, when she collapsed and died after complaining about a headache.Her mother, Maria Morgan, told Wales Online: “I then looked through my daughter’s bags, drawers and bedroom and as a typically untidy teenager found hundreds of sugar free Trident wrappers and receipts.”Excess intake of aspartame and or sorbitol, two sweetener ingredients in sugar-free gum, may have interfered with electrolytes in Samantha Jenkins’ body, causing her salt levels to drop.Lumps of gum found in her stomach may also have affected the teenager’s ability to absorb vital minerals.Jenkins suffered a brain stem death due to swelling of the brain caused by convulsions from lack of salt, magnesium and calcium.Jenkins was eating 14 sticks of chewing gum per day, which means she was consuming about 16.8 grams of artificial sweeteners, “a fairly substantial amount,” pathologist Paul Griffiths told Swansea coroner’s court.The Carmarthenshire Coroner is set to open an inquest into Samantha's death next week.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAs millions of voters head to the polls in the UK general elections, the country could be heading toward a hung parliament.In UK elections, a party must win at least 326 of 650 seats in the House of Commons to obtain an absolute majority.In the event that no party wins that number, a hung parliament occurs,, which means that no party has the majority.Without the cooperation of other parties, the party with the plurality of seats might not have enough votes to pass legislation.In this event, the largest parties -- either the Conservative Party or the Labour Party -- can attempt to form a coalition with other parties and reach a majority.If there is no ground for a coalition, the party with most seats will have to start negotiations with the other parties.The final results of the UK general elections are expected on May 8th in the afternoon.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twUS researchers have developed a system CellScope that uses a smartphone to detect the Loa loa parasite, commonly known as the “eye worm” in blood samples.The smartphone needs to be mounted on a base, which contains a slot for the blood sample. The camera on the smartphone records the motion of any organisms in the blood sample and an algorithm analyzes the data within two minutes, according to a press release by UC Berkeley.The result can be used to determine whether the patient is suitable for treatment with the drug ivermectin, which can be fatal to those with high levels of Loa loa worm, the BBC reported.“There are drugs to treat many neglected tropical diseases, these are problems that should be solved, but there is not the technology to identify people who need the right drugs,” Prof Daniel Fletcher, one of the project’s researchers told the BBC.The method has successfully reduced the rate of human error in early field tests.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA 243-page report released by the NFL on Wednesday has revealed “it is more probable, than not” that New England Patriots personnel deliberately deflated footballs below league standards, according to a New York Times report. The long awaited report, commissioned in response to the“deflategate” controversy, investigated allegations that New England Patriots personnel purposely deflated balls used in January’s AFC championship game, which saw them defeat the Indianapolis Colts 45-7.The report says New England Patriots locker room attendant Jim McNally and equipment assistant John Jastremski released air from 11 of 12 game balls with Patriots quarterback Tom Brady aware of the deflation.  No other Patriots personnel, including Coach Bill Belichick, are believed to have been aware of the deflated footballs. A regulation NFL football has to be inflated between 12.5 to 13.5 pounds per inch. 11 footballs tested during the AFC championship game in January, were found to be significantly underinflated.Deflated balls are easier to throw, catch, and grip than standard regulation footballs.

      <title>How the UK electoral system works</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twOn May 7 Britain is called to vote for the composition of the House of Commons, and by extension, for a new government.To elect the 650 members of the House of Commons, or lower house, the UK prime minister has to meet with the Queen before five years and a month have passed since the previous elections. The Queen then dissolves the Parliament and the new elections can begin. The elections for the new seats are held in the 650 territorial constituencies in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. About 60,000 electors in each constituency vote for their favorite candidate.The candidate with more votes gets a seat, and the leader of the party with the majority of seats automatically becomes the country’s Prime Minister and is called to form the government.If neither of the leading parties, Labour party or the Conservative party, obtains a majority, as it happened in 2010, the party with most seats can try to form a coalition government with the largest of the smaller parties, the Liberal Democrats.If there is no ground for a coalition however, a minority government could also be formed and the largest party, despite lacking a majority, could still see legislations get through.According to the Independent, in this 2015 elections, neither leading party looks like it will get a majority, and a coalition seems a necessary step. If David Cameron, UK current prime minister, wins, he will probably continue the coalition with the Liberal Democrats. If Labour party leader Ed Miliband wins, he will have to work with  the Scottish National Party, with the Liberal Democrats and more likely with some of the small parties like the Greens, Plaid Cymru or the ones from Northern Ireland.

      <title>Boeing 787 Dreamliner electrical glitch might cause plane to shut down mid flight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Federal Aviation Administration warned on Friday that a software glitch in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner could cause the plane to power down mid flight. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Boeing has found that if the four engine generators are left working continuously for about eight months or 248 days, a software internal counter could possibly overflow and cause a loss of all electrical power, even mid flight.The aerospace manufacturer told the New York Times that it would be rare for a plane to remain powered on without interruption for eight months.Four of the Dreamliner’s six electrical generators are mounted on its two engines. The generators provide power for a variety of functions, including the plane's electronic systems, cabin pressure and wing de-icers.Even if the main generators failed, the Dreamliner’s main lithium-ion batteries could still provide power to the flight deck for six seconds, before a ram air turbine could be deployed. The amount of power provided by the turbine would be sufficient to allow the pilots to turn the engines back on or fly to the nearest airport.According to Boeing, shutting the plane’s electrical systems down periodically would also eliminate the risk of the all plane’s power generators shutting down at the same time.Boeing has so far delivered more than 250,000 dreamliners to several carriers, including Jetstar, Japan Airlines, Air India, and Ethiopian Airlines.]]></description>

      <title>Daredevil Nik Wallenda walks across ferris wheel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twDaredevil Nik Wallenda added a new record to his thick portfolio Wednesday morning when he successfully walked across a giant moving ferris wheel in Orlando.  The Orlando Eye rotated at walking pace as Nik crossed from one pod to another, moving against the spin’s direction. The new ferris wheel is 400 feet tall, which is roughly equivalent to a 35-story building and taller than the Statue of Liberty. It’s not Nik’s highest accomplishment -- he was about 1400 feet in the air when he crossed the Grand Canyon -- but normally he has a balancing pole with him, which aids his center of gravity. “Without a balancing pole, it’s really challenging,” Wallenda said in a video interview provided by Reuters. “Everything happens quicker. With the balancing pole, it buys me a little time,” he said. He also had to duck under obstacles during the ferris wheel walk, which added an additional challenge. “There’s gonna be a lot going on for sure,” Wallenda said prior to the walk. Overnight rain made the steel beam slippery, and Wallenda estimated the wind to be at 20 mph as he crossed the wheel. Despite the challenges, Wallenda completed the walk in just four minutes. The walk aired live on NBC’s “Today.” The Orlando Eye is the tallest observation wheel on the East Coast, USA Today reported. The ferris wheel is set to open publically on May 4th.

"The new ferris wheel is 400 feet tall -- about the equivalent of a 35-story building." " It’s not Nik’s highest accomplishment. He was about 1400 feet in the air when he crossed the Grand Canyon."

US federal officers were patrolling near the San Ysidro Port of Entry fence when they found a sinkhole in the ground. The discovery led them to an underground tunnel that connected the northern edge of the Mexican city of Tijuana with the south end of San Diego.According to El Pais, the tunnel, which was destroyed the day after its discovery, had a single entry inside a home in Tijuana and was about 220 yards long and 60 feet deep.Tall enough for a person to walk through, the tunnel was still under construction but already fitted with reinforced walls, electric lighting and a cart-and-rail cargo-hauling system. This kind of tunnel underneath the border between the US and Mexico isn’t uncommon and is usually used for drugs or people’s smuggling.

      <title>Florida avocado crop threatened by deadly fungus (UPDATE)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CORRECTION: Refeed replaces SD video with HD videoRESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twResearchers in Florida are using dogs and drones in the fight against a disease that is threatening the state’s multimillion dollar avocado industry, as part of a Florida International University program funded by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.The disease, laurel wilt, is caused by the fungus Raffaelea lauricola, and kills more than 90 percent of trees within six weeks of infection. Laurel wilt is vectored by the ambrosia beetle, an invasive species from Asia.For the project, researchers are testing the use of a drone and dogs to detect the disease before symptoms are visible to the human eye. Using drones allows large areas to be scanned much faster than it would take humans to examine every individual tree.The drone uses a digital thermal imaging camera to scan areas for infected trees. If a problem area is detected, disease-sniffing dogs are dispatched to confirm the presence of an infection. If the infection is caught early enough, the tree can be saved by treating it with fungicide.Florida’s avocado industry is worth more than $35 million a year to the state’s economy.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Oxford-based start-up to use drones to plant one billion trees a year</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twOxford-based start-up Biocarbon Engineering is planning to fight industrial deforestation by planting 1 billion trees a year using drones.Currently, 26 billions trees are cut down every year, while only 15 billions are replanted. The drones used by Biocarbon Engineering could solve the problem by making tree planting faster and cheaper. In a video made by the company, Biocarbon Engineering explains that the drones would first fly above a selected area, map its level of deforestation and report back its potential for reforestation. Then, automated planting drones carrying seed pods would fly one to two metres above the ground, following a pre-determined planting pattern, and fire germinated seeds into the soil.A small pressurized canister would provide the necessary propulsive force for the seed pods to easily penetrate the soil surface. The seed pods, filled with nutritious hydrogel to reduce the force of the seed’s impact with the soil, would then break open upon impact and allow the germinated seeds to grow. According to the Independent, one drone is able to plant 10 seeds per minute. With two operators controlling multiple drones, 36,000 trees could be planted in a single day.Biocarbon Engineering hopes to have the system fully working by the end of the summer. According to the Independent, the drone system is not as good as hand-sowing, but it’s much quicker and less expensive than traditional planting systems.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

Doctors told her she was affected by a brain tumor. Instead, after surgery she found out that the tumor was in fact an embryonic twin. An embryonic twin occurs when a twin embryo develops in utero and the pair doesn’t fully separate. One embryo then keeps developing at the expense of the other one.The non-dominant embryo eventually dies in utero and is partially or completely reabsorbed by the dominant twin.Karanam made fun of her embryonic twin by telling NBC Los Angeles that it was her “evil twin sister who’s been torturing me for the past 26 years.”After undergoing minimally invasive brain surgery, she is expected to make full recovery.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Blue Bell Creameries recalls all products over listeria contamination</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twTexas-based Blue Bell Creameries is voluntarily recalling all of its products due to a potential Listeria contamination.The recall comes weeks after listeria bacteria was found in Blue Bell’s chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream produced on March 17, 2015, according to the company’s press release. The bacteria was traced to two production lines in Brenham, Texas and Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, NBC News reported. The recall covers retail outlets in 23 US states and internationally.“We’re committed to doing the 100 percent right thing, and the best way to do that is to take all of our products off the market until we can be confident that they are all safe,” Fox31 Denver quoted Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president as saying.  Listeriosis is a bacterial infection that primarily affects elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weak immune systems. Its symptoms include fever, muscle aches and gastrointestinal disorders.The recall comes two weeks after an earlier smaller recall which followed the deaths from listeriosis of three people at a Kansas hospital who authorities believe may have gotten the illness after eating Blue Bell products.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twCalifornia's three-year-old drought is prompting San Diego County to push ahead with the largest desalination plant in the western hemisphere. The Carlsbad Desalination Project is located at the Encina Power Station in the city of Carlsbad, California. Water is drawn from seawater that passes through a series of filters to remove solids and other suspended particles not visible to the naked eye.Pressure pumps then move the filtered seawater into pressure vessels housing reverse osmosis membranes. The membranes convert the water into high-quality drinking water and concentrated seawater.The drinking water is then stored and the concentrated seawater is released back into the ocean.The high costs of constructing and running the desalination plant may pose challenges. Environmentalists have also expressed concerns about the impact of the facilities on marine life.The $1 billion project has been under construction since 2012 by Poseidon Water and is due to being operating in November. It will deliver up to 50 million gallons of water a day to San Diego County, enough to supply roughly 112,000 households, or about 10 percent of the county's drinking water needs.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Logical reasoning question in Singaporean Math Olympiad goes viral</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA logical reasoning question for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad has gone viral after a TV presenter posted it on Facebook, leaving many people across the globe stumped.The mind-boggling question states that two boys, Albert and Bernard, became friends with a girl called Cheryl and wanted to know her birthday. Cheryl gave them ten possible dates, including May 15, May 16,  May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15 and August 17. Then, she told Albert and Bernard the month and day of her birthday respectively.The question continues and states that Albert is not sure about her birthday yet but certain that Bernard, who was told the day, does not know either. From this, it is possible to eliminate the two unique dates, May 19 and June 18. If Cheryl had told Albert her birthday was in May or June then these two dates would still be valid.  But Albert knows that Bernard does not know her birthday so this means she must have told Albert that the month is either July or August.Bernard then says he has deducted the answer from the five remaining dates. It is impossible that the day of Cheryl’s birthday is 14 because if this was the case, there would be two possible dates, July 14 and August 14, and Bernard would not be able to ascertain the answer. So, only three possible dates, July 16, August 15 and August 16 are left.Albert also obtains the answer after these clues. Since he only knows the month of Cheryl’s birthday, the answer must be July 16. If Cheryl told Albert she was born in August, Albert could not have deducted the answer because there would still be two possible dates.Henry Ong, executive director of the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad, said the birthday question is a difficult one that aims to sift out the most intelligent students.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe United States defense department has accused Russia of an aggravated and unsafe air interception of a reconnaissance plane over the Baltic Sea on April 7.A U.S. RC-135U plane was flying in international airspace over Poland near Russia’s Kaliningrad region, when a Russian SU-27 Flanker approached the aircraft from behind at high speed. According to early reports, the Russian aircraft reportedly passed within six meters of the unarmed American plane.The SU-27 then performed two more close passes of the U.S. plane.Russian officials have denied doing anything wrong and alleged the RC-135U’s transponder was turned off. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman. Major General Igor Konashenkov claimed the Russian jet made several passes was only trying to identify the plane and its tail number. A U.S. European Command official said that claim was false, and that the Pentagon intends to file a complaint with the the Russian military.“Unprofessional air intercepts have the potential to cause harm to all aircrews involved. More importantly, the careless actions of a single pilot have the potential to escalate tensions between countries,” Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said on Sunday.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[Britain said on Thursday it had summoned Argentina’s ambassador to explain a threat to take legal action against British energy companies drilling for oil in the Falklands, just days after the 33rd anniversary of the Falklands Conflict.The threat comes a week after Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and ambassador Alicia Castro criticized Britain’s plan to beef up defences on the islands amid reports of an increased risk of invasion from Argentina.Some British 1,200 troops are based at the British garrison on the Falklands at Mount Pleasant, about 35 miles from the capital, Stanley.Last month, Britain announced it would send two Chinook helicopters to the islands as well as a new air defense missile system, as part of a £180 million upgrade to the islands’ defenses. The announcement was made amid reports that Argentina was in talks to lease 12 Sukhoi Su-24 bombers from Russia.Argentina has intensified its claims to the islands in recent years. Britain and Argentina fought a brief war over the islands in 1982 after Argentina invaded the islands. More than 600 Argentine and 225 British servicemen were killed in the conflict.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>New designer drug &#x201C;Flakka&#x201D; on the rise</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA new puzzling drug called “flakka” has hit the streets of Florida, Texas and Ohio, leading to an odd streak of paranoid crimes.The designer drug is made up of alpha-PVP, a close cousin to the main ingredient in the banned bath salt drug. The other ingredients in flakka change and vary, making it difficult for law enforcement officials to ban. Forbes reports the drug’s effects can last anywhere from 3 hours to several days. Because the drug is relatively new, scientists can only guess that it works like most uppers, by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. The drug leads to a spike in the user’s heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature. Users may also experience superhuman strength. When flakka leaves the body, the user experiences an intense comedown and may take another dose to combat the resulting depression. This leads to a highly addictive drug, much like bath salts. Hallucinations and delusions often accompany the high, which can cause erratic behavior. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Flakka pebbles from an unmarked bottle, alpha-PVP molecule models in the flakka2.

Because the drug is relatively new, scientists can only assume it works like most uppers, by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine [nor-eh-pinn-EFF-rinn] levels in the brain. The drug leads to a spike in the user’s vital signs, and many users have claimed feelings of super-human strength. When the drug leaves the body, the user likely feels a pull to take the drug again to combat the come-down, making flakka highly addictive. Hallucinations and delusions often accompany the high, which can cause erratic behavior.

      <title>Russia plans to build superhighway connecting London with New York</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twDriving from London to New York City would be possible if Russia succeeds in building a superhighway spanning across the country with links to western Europe and Asia. During a March meeting, head of the Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin unveiled an ambitious plan called the Trans-Eurasian Belt Development, which entails constructing a superhighway and an accompanying high-speed railway. If the plan is realised, motorists will be able to drive from London to New York. Russia hopes the development will spur the economies of remote cities and towns. The Trans-Siberian Railway is about 9,000 kilometres long. According to CNN, a road trip from London to New York would cover about 20,777 kilometers. Yakunin said other infrastructure such as oil pipelines, power plants and water supply facilities will be built alongside the highway and high-speed railway. The mega highway system will face a multitude of difficulties, one of them being the connection to Alaska across the Bering Strait. Either a long bridge or a undersea tunnel would be needed.

      <title>How drone-style system could prevent further Germanwings crash</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Existing technology could allow for planes to become more automated and give ground staff the ability to seize control of planes if necessary. In this system that would make planes more like drones, planes can communicate with the air traffic control tower either directly or via satellite link. In response to information from the plane, air traffic control can override the cockpit commands and input commands into computers in the control tower to maintain stable flight.Boeing patented an ‘uninterruptible pilot system’ in 2009, that prevents ‘unauthorized flights.’ The fly-by-wire system can navigate an aircraft to a predetermined destination and land the aircraft safely if the aircraft encounters trouble. Andreas Lubitz, co-pilot on Germanwings flight 4U9525, was able crash the aircraft by locking the captain out of the cockpit and turning off autopilot. Under a fly-by-wire system like the one designed by Boeing, ground crew would have been able to wrest control of the aircraft. The practice of flying airplanes from the ground is currently limited to military purposes despite the ability to extend the same technology to commercial flights. Unmanned aircraft are controversial though as critics often cite the fear of hacking.]]></description>

      <title>Woman undergoes bionic eye surgery in Honolulu to restore vision</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA 72-year-old woman in Hawaii, who was blinded by a hereditary eye disease two years ago, received a bionic eye implant last week that will partially restore her vision. She is the first person in Asia-Pacific to receive a bionic eye implant. The woman underwent the four-hour procedure last Tuesday at the Hawaii Eye Surgery Center in Honolulu. The bionic eye implant is currently only able to restore partial vision. After she recovers from the surgery, the woman will be able to detect motion, and eventually she will be able to see up to nine colors. The bionic eye implant, officially known as the Argus II Retinus Prosthesis System (Argus II), aims to restore the eye’s ability to convert images to electrical impulses. During the eye implant surgery, the eyeball is attached to a bionic case with an electronic array that’s implanted underneath the retina. The patient will have to wear bionic glasses with a camera attached. As the camera captures images, a video-processing chip within a handheld unit then converts these images to electronic pulses. These signals are then sent back to the glasses, and the pulses relayed to a receiver on the eyeball. The receiver then transmits the pulses to the electronic array, which then uses these pulses to stimulate the optic nerve and send information to the brain.The woman was blinded by Retinitis pigmentosa, a disease that causes the retinal rod cells and cone cells to degenerate. These cells are responsible for receiving light and converting them into electrical impulses that are then sent to the brain. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>NASA&#x2019;s Asteroid Redirect Mission to protect Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNASA announced a plan on Wednesday regarding a future mission to change the trajectory of an asteroid. The mission may have the potential to protect Earth from an impending asteroid impact in the future.NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission or ARM, scheduled for the mid-2020’s, involves sending a robotic spacecraft to an asteroid passing by Earth. The robot will then do a series of fly-by optical surveys of the asteroid surface.The robot would then land on the asteroid for the boulder collection portion of the mission which would last about 10 minutes.After pushing away from the asteroid and three days of analysing the boulder, it will begin the planetary defense portion of the mission. Using the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and boulder, they will attempt to deflect the asteroid, a process they call Enhanced Gravity Tractor.It will then take about six years for the robot to return to lunar orbit where astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will dock with the robot to further study the boulder. The current concept for the manned portion of ARM involves two-astronauts and is expected to take take about three-and-a-half weeks. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The robot spacecraft approaching an asteroid2.

      <title>How an Airbus A320 cockpit cabin door security works</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe co-pilot of Germanwings flight 4U9525 Andreas Lubitz was locked inside the cockpit by himself at the time of the crash. The door defaults to a locked position when closed but the Lubitz refused to unlock the door upon captain’s request.According to an Airbus video describing the standard procedure for entering the flight deck, the captain of the Airbus A320 would have requested reentry into the cockpit by first notifying the co-pilot by phone that he wanted to enter before pressing the hashtag on a keypad outside the cockpit door. A buzzer would then sound for three seconds inside the cockpit alerting the co-pilot to unlock the doorsomething Lubitz didn’t do.If it were a case of an incapacitated co-pilot, the captain could have entered a numerical code that would trigger an override of the lock. The alert would then sound for 30 seconds before the door unlocks, giving the person outside five seconds to enter. However, this emergency unlock process can be overridden by manually switching the control to the lock position. In this case, the keypad and buzzer are deactivated and the door remains locked for five minutes unless otherwise unlocked from inside the flight deck. “He operated this button for a reason we don't know yet,” Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told reporters. “But it appears that the reason was to destroy this plane.” RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAustralian researchers have found that mice suffering from Alzheimer’s performed much better in behaviour tests after receiving ultrasound treatment, a discovery that could give hope in the battle to find a cure for humans suffering from the degenerative illness.Neurotransmitter activities are disrupted in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients. Beta amyloids, a natural protein, accumulated in a patient’s brain, leading to the formation of plaques that can damage nerve cells. The cerebral cortex of Alzheimer’s patients also shrink as symptoms progress. Scientists at the University of Queensland in Australia conducted a series of tests in which they injected a solution containing tiny gas bubbles in mice. Ultrasound treatment helps the gas bubbles to expand. The bubbles then temporarily open a gap in the blood-brain barrier, allowing the entrance of antibodies into the brain. The antibodies remove toxic beta amyloids thus reducing the size of plaques in the patient’s brain.Researchers plan to carry out the same tests in larger animals such as sheep. Tests in humans will be more difficult because of the harder human skull, which ultrasonic waves cannot easily penetrate.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>World Tuberculosis Day 2015 highlights disease that kills 1.5 million people every year</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twWorld Tuberculosis Day is held on March 24 to spread awareness about a disease that, according to the World Health Organization, kills 1.5 million people globally every year and infected 9 million people in 2013.India is currently experiencing a tuberculosis epidemic. The country accounts for about a quarter of new tuberculosis cases each year, and around 300,000 people die from the disease in India every year. Zarir F. Udwadia, a doctor at the P.D. Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre, one of the best private hospitals in Mumbai, told AFP that India spends only 5 billion rupees, or about $80 million, each year on anti-tuberculosis programmes, the least among the BRICS group of developing countries.“Patients with TB in India typically flit between an unsympathetic public sector and an exploitative private sector until they are too sick or impoverished to do so, all the while continuing to transmit and spread tuberculosis in crowded home and work environments,” Udwadia told AFP. Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a bacteria that most commonly affects the lungs. The disease is transmitted after people inhale tuberculosis germs when those with the disease cough or sneeze. A person with tuberculosis can infect up to 15 people through close contact over the course of a year, according to the World Health Organization.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Angelina Jolie has ovaries removed over cancer concern</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAngelina Jolie announced in a New York Times opinion piece that she had her fallopian tubes and ovaries removed last week to prevent ovarian cancer, two years after undergoing a double mastectomy after learning she had inherited a high risk of breast cancer.Blood test results revealed that Jolie carried a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. According to Jolie, the BRCA mutation gave her an estimated 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer. Jolie, 39, underwent a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to remove her fallopian tubes and ovaries. During this process, a tube is inserted into the abdomen via incisions, and CO2 is pumped in to widen the abdominal cavity. Surgeons insert a laparoscope with a camera attached into the abdomen, which allows doctors to see internal organs. Surgeons then remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes with surgical tools.BRCA gene mutations are contained in chromosomes 13 and 17. The mutations may be inherited from either parent. There’s a 50 percent chance that parents will pass their BRCA mutation to a child because each parent contributes a chromosome to the child during reproduction.About 5 to 10 percent of all cancers are related to an inherited gene abnormality. Among the hereditary factors that can lead to cancer, BRCA mutations may be associated with cancer 90 percent of the time.Jolie has emphasized that her decision was not based solely on the fact that she carries the mutation, but was also because three women in her family have died from cancer.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twAt least 2,000 migrating snow geese carcasses were found dead in Idaho, apparently from avian cholera, over the weekend, wildlife managers said Monday.According to Idaho Department of Fish and Game spokesman Gregg Losinski, it’s unknown how the snow geese contracted the disease while migrating from the Southwest and Mexico to nesting grounds in Alaska. The carcasses were retrieved and incinerated in fear of other wildlife ingesting the bacteria.Avian cholera is highly contagious and the bacteria can survive in wetlands for up to four months. Symptoms of avian cholera could include convulsions, erratic flying, swimming in circles, or blood-stained, fawn-colored or yellow droppings.Death from the disease may be so rapid that birds literally fall out of the sky with no previous signs of the symptoms.Although humans face little risk of contracting the disease, avian cholera is the most infectious disease affecting wild waterfowl in North America.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>South African doctors perform world&#x2019;s first penis transplant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA team of doctors in South Africa completed the world’s first successful penis transplant in December. According to surgeons at Cape Town’s Tygerberg Hospital and at Stellenbosch University, the patient has since “regained all function in the newly transplanted organ.”Surgeons at Tygerberg Hospital used techniques employed in the first face transplants to attach blood vessels and nerves in the penis of a 21-year-old man who had lost his penis in a coming-of-age ritual. During the nine-hour procedure, surgeons first isolated the blood vessels and secured them with a clamp. They then stitched the blood vessels together using sutures and 5-8 stitches. Doctors completed a similar procedure with the nerves in the donor penis.This particular surgical procedure was challenging because of how tiny blood vessels in the penis are. Compared to blood vessels in the human kidney, which have an average diameter of 10 millimetres, and arteries connecting to the lungs, which can have an average diameter of 3.5 millimetres, blood vessels in the penis are just 1.5 millimetres wide.Three months after the procedure, the man now has a penis that can pass urine, ejaculate, and perform just as well as any other penis. Doctors say that this procedure can eventually be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer, or to those suffering from severe erectile dysfunction. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Mattel&#x2019;s internet-connected Barbie doll alarms privacy advocates</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twToymaker, Mattel Inc., has announced an internet connected Barbie doll which features interactive conversation with its user. However, privacy advocates fear the doll’s cloud-based technology exposes children to eavesdropping by Mattel, or anyone with access to the company’s servers. The doll, named Hello Barbie, uses technology developed by a company called ToyTalk. The doll converses with its user by recording audio files of the user’s speech when the record button is pressed. The Wifi-connected doll then sends those files to Mattel’s servers where the speech is decoded and processed. A conversational reply is then sent back over the internet and played by the doll. Mattel’s servers retain information about each user in order to personalize the doll’s responses. For instance, the doll remembers the user’s name, likes, and dislikes. Parents can also have the doll’s collected recordings of their child’s voice emailed to them daily or weekly, so they can know what their child is telling the doll. This feature by itself has been called a potential invasion of children’s right to privacy. ToyTalk says the information collected by the doll will not be used for marketing purposes, and a statement from Mattel says “Mattel is committed to safety and security, and Hello Barbie conforms to applicable government standards.”The doll will be available for purchase starting in Fall 2015. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Child talking to doll, doll responds2. Doll recording speech, sending audio via wifi3. Mattel cloud server collecting and responding to recordings from dolls4.

      <title>Study shows Mars once had more water than Arctic</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNew research by NASA indicates a primitive ocean on Mars once held more water than the Earth’s Arctic Ocean. Some 4.3 billion years ago, Mars was a far wetter place with five million cubic miles (20 million cubic kilometers ) of water, according to a team of scientists. The researchers believe that this water was not spread evenly across the planet, but rather, collected in the northern hemisphere's Northern Plains. Mars ancient ocean likely covered 19 percent of its surface and in some places went down up to a mile deep. This body of water would have been larger than the Earth's Arctic Ocean, covering a relative area comparable to the Atlantic Ocean, which occupies 17 percent of the Earth’s surface.   The Red Planet is believed to have had a volume of water 6.5 times greater than what is in the ice caps today, indicating a massive loss of water into space.  Researchers discovered one of the major differences between ancient and modern Mars to be their respective water molecules. Water, ordinarily H2O, has another variant, HDO, which consists of a hydrogen atom, an oxygen atom, and a deuterium atom, which replaces the second hydrogen atom.Deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, that has a neutron in its nucleus. By comparing the ratio of HDO to H20 in water found on Mars today, water that was trapped in a Mars meteorite dating back some 4.5 billion years, scientists were able to determine how much water had escaped into space. This measurement process took nearly six years to map out. As since these heavier water molecules do not escape from the atmosphere as easily as ordinary water molecules, the planet has less light water compared to heavy water. Here on Earth, the HDO/H20 ratio is 1:3,200, but on Mars it is 1:400. This ratio indicates that Mars has lost 87 percent of its water. This not only indicates that Mars once had more water, but was wetter for a longer time. "With Mars losing that much water, the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought,” said Senior Goddard scientist Michael Mumma, according to a NASA press release. “Suggesting it might have been habitable for longer.”RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Mars as a dry planet that transforms into ancient wet Mars.2. Mars water in the northern hemisphere's Northern Plains that forms an ocean. 3. Mar’s body of water versus Earth’s Arctic Ocean contrast bigger than Atlantic Ocean. 4. Mar’s has a massive water loss that transitions to the dry red planet it is today. 5. Water molecule H2O versus another form of water molecule made up of HDO, (hydrogen atom, an oxygen atom, and a deuterium atom). 6. Mars transforms from dry climate to wet, vast abundance of oceans and signs of life.VOICEOVER (in English): “New research by NASA indicates that Mars had five million cubic miles of water some 4.3 billion years ago.”“The water is believed to not have been spread evenly over the red planet, but instead collected in the Northern Plains on the planet’s northern hemisphere.”“Mars ancient ocean likely covered 19 percent of its surface, a relative area comparable to the Atlantic Ocean, which occupies 17 percent of the Earth’s surface.”“Water’s other form, less familiar than H20 is called HDO.

      <title>How earthquakes could impact California</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twResearchers at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said in study called the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3) last week that Californians have a 7% chance of being affected by a magnitude-8 or larger earthquake within the next 30 years, an increase of 2.3% since 2008 predictions. However, the study predicts fewer earthquakes of magnitudes 6.5 to 7.5 than was previously thought, from once every 4.8 years to once every 6.3 years.Earthquakes occur when the earth’s plates shift thereby releasing pressure that is built up along fault lines. There are various types of faults including normal faults where the the inclined plate moves down. A strike-slip fault occurs when there is a horizontal shift and a thrust fault occurs when an inclined plate is pushed up. Vibrations are then sent through the ground at different speeds. P waves, or compressional waves, move the quickest and shake the ground back and forth parallel to the direction the wave is moving. S waves, or shear waves, shake the ground back and forth perpendicular to the direction of the wave and cause the most damage. Surface waves are seismic waves trapped near the surface. The last time a major earthquake occurred along the San Andreas Fault in California was 1690. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. The various types of faults that cause an earthquake2.

      <title>Bionic reconstruction allows amputees to mind-control their prosthesis arm</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThree Austrian men with brachial plexus injuries have become the first people in the world to receive a mind-controlled prosthetic arm based on a new technique known as 'bionic reconstruction.'Researchers from the Medical University of Vienna in Austria and the University Medical Center Göttingen in Germany developed the technique that combines selective nerve and muscle transfers, elective amputation, and an advanced robotic prosthesis.Brachial plexus injuries, often a result of trauma from high-speed collisions, disconnect the hand from the brain.Researchers were able to record and use the signal from slight contractions in the muscles when the patients move their shoulder, elbow and forearm normally to open the bionic hand. To close the bionic hand, researchers transplanted a muscle from the thigh into the forearm to amplify a secondary nerve signal. A combination of these two signals allows the patient to rotate the wrist.Patients undergo cognitive training for nine months to activate the muscles, then learning to use the electrical signals to control a virtual hand. Once they master the cognitive training, they start training with a prosthetic hand attached to their non-functioning hand. In order to complete the bionic reconstruction, patients have to amputate the existing hand for the prosthetic to connect with the arm.Three months after the amputation, all three men were able to use their robotic arm to complete tasks they were not able to do before the procedure.Researchers plan to apply the technique to patients with a functionless hand or leg caused by different injuries. They are also examining ways to decode muscular signals to achieve more intuitive control of the prosthesis.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Brachial plexus injuries2. How to open the robotic arm3.

Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles reported Thursday that 67 of their patients were potentially exposed to the deadly bacteria with four confirmed infections. Hartford Hospital, reported 180 patients may have been exposed and at least 5 patients were infected.CNN reported that the $30,000 duodenoscope used on the infected patients was often cleaned with a $1 toothbrush.

      <title>New York City&#x2019;s Second Avenue subway line construction may be delayed again</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA $15 billion gap in the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s five-year capital plan may curtail the city’s Second Avenue subway project. According to MTA Chairman Tom Prendergast, funding gaps in MTA’s $32 billion capital proposal will probably mean that the second phase of the construction project will be eliminated. This phase of the construction project extends from 96th Street to 125th Street in East Harlem. Prendergast told the New York Daily News that the MTA’s priorities are repairing and replacing equipment in the existing subway lines rather than extending new lines. If the Second Avenue subway project is completed, the new subway line will stretch 8.5 miles along the east side of Manhattan and connect East Harlem to the island’s southern tip. The project’s first phase, which extends from 96th Street to 63rd Street, will be completed by the end of 2016. As a project that’s been in the works since the 1920, the Second Avenue subway line has endured numerous false starts and delays mainly due to lack of funding. The New York State budget is up for negotiation this April though, and Governor Cuomo has hinted that transit funding is up for negotiation later this year. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>U.S. switching to chip-enabled credit cards</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twU.S. credit card companies have set an October deadline for a switch to chip-enabled cards. Such cards come with embedded computer chips that make them far more difficult to clone, according to banks and card makers. However, counterfeit cards account for only about 37 percent of credit card fraud, and the new technology is just as vulnerable as current swipe-card systems, security experts say. The changes will require U.S. consumers to switch out their old cards for new ones, and retailers will also need to upgrade their payment terminals. This will all come at a price tag of US$8.65 billion while only addressing a small range of security issues, Reuters reports.The data on the new chip-enabled cards is stored on a computer chip, not a magnetic stripe, with customers able to use the cards by punching in a four-digit personal identification number instead of signing the screen. However, the U.S. does not plan to issue PIN codes and will continue requiring customers to sign their signatures at checkout.Chips function like small computers by storing data, and processing that information when communicating with a card reader. The chip itself is devoid of a power source, but will function when in contact with a checkout terminal. This means card readers do not have to be connected to a phone or Internet line to process a charge. They can simply work offline and process the charge using the chip alone, before authorizing the charges in bulk later on.Reuters reports security experts say the technology still leaves data unprotected at three key points: When it enters a payment terminal, when it is transmitted through a processor, and when it is stored in a retailer’s information systems. The new cards also do not protect against data being stolen during online transactions.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Chip implanted into credit card2.

      <title>Science explains why people perceive color differently</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA photograph of a cocktail dress went viral online recently after it had people divided on whether the dress was actually white with a gold lace trim, or blue with a black lace trim. The dress, designed by British clothing company, Roman, is in reality royal blue with black lace trim.However, many people who saw the picture of the dress  which was photographed in odd lighting conditions  saw the garment as white and gold. Scientists have now weighed in with an explanation.When light enters a person’s eyes through through the lens, it hits the retina in the back of the eye where pigments stimulate neural connections to the visual cortex. The visual cortex is the part of the brain that processes signals into an image. A person’s brain determines what colour light is reflecting off the objects the person is trying to see, and subtracts that colour from the genuine color of the object.This is how people are able to determine a constant color of an object even when the lighting conditions continually change. The brain uses reference points from the colours around the object, the colour and brightness of light and previous knowledge to determine the actual colour of the object. This is called colour constancy.However, in the case of the photograph of the dress, some experts say the light source and colour is ambiguous, which has caused different people to perceive the colour of the dress differently.“What’s happening here is your visual system is looking at this thing, and you’re trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis,” Wired quoted Bevil Conway as saying.Conway, a neuroscientist who studies color and vision at Wellesley College, added, “So people either discount the blue side, in which case they end up seeing white and gold, or discount the gold side, in which case they end up with blue and black.” Conway, for his part, sees blue and orange.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Lightwaves entering the eyeball2. Demonstration of how lighting changes throughout the day3. Perceived overexposure4. Perceived underexposureVOICEOVER (in English): “Lightwaves enter the eyes and activate cones and rods, which allow people to interpret color based on how the light is perceived  this is called color constancy.” “Based on visual cues and previous knowledge, the eye determines the correct color of objects even when lighting is constantly changing.”“Someone who perceives this scene as overexposed may have activated cones, which are sensitive to reds, greens and blues. This perceived overexposure is compensated by the brain assuming the ball is a darker shade of blue. Someone who perceives this scene as underexposed may have activated rods, which are sensitive to the colors black and white. This perception is compensated by the brain removing the darker shades from the image, thus causing the ball to appear whiter.”“Someone who decided the dress was brightly illuminated may have assumed it was made of darker fabrics such as blue and black. However, if someone decided there was only dim illumination, their brain may have thought the dress was reflecting a lot of the light falling on it, in which case it must be made of more reflective fabrics, such as white and gold."SOURCES: Wired, Yahoo, National Geographic, The Guardian, Voxhttp://www.wired.com/2015/02/science-one-agrees-color-dress/https://www.yahoo.com/health/what-thedress-color-you-see-says-about-you-112243093272.htmlhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/02/150227-blue-white-dress-optical-illusion-science/http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2015/feb/27/the-dress-blue-black-white-gold-vision-psychology-colour-constancyhttp://www.vox.com/2015/2/27/8119901/explain-color-dress***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Saharan dust fertilizes Amazon&#x2019;s plants, NASA study reveals</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe Sahara desert, the world’s largest desert, fertilizes the Amazon rainforest, also the world’s largest, according to atmospheric scientist Hongbin Yu, the lead author of a study by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.Relying on satellite data, NASA recently released an estimate of how much phosphorus is in the dust that travels from the Sahara to the Amazon basin. Each year, million tons of phosphorus-laden dust gets blown from the Sahara, more specifically from an ancient lake bed called the Bodele Depression in Chad, to the Amazon by strong winds.About 182 million tons of dust, enough to fill 689,290 semi-trucks, are carried across the Atlantic Ocean, where about 27.7 million tons of dust, enough to fill some 104,908 semi-trucks, fall atop of the Amazon.Phosphorus is essential to the growth of plants, which the Amazon depends on in order to flourish. Most of the Amazon’s phosphorus is washed away by rain into streams and out of the forest, but the amount lost, roughly 22,000 tons, is made up for by the dust from the Sahara desert.The pattern of dust transported annually is highly variable. Scientists believe this variation could have been affected by high rainfall in the Sahel region, the long strip of semi-arid land on the southern border of the Sahara.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Neuroscientist says human head transplant could happen in two years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe world's first attempt to transplant a human head will be launched this year at a surgical conference in the United States. The procedure was first proposed  in 2013 by Sergio Canavero of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group in Italy to help extend the lives of people suffering from muscle and nerve degeneration or those who have advanced cancer. Canavero said the surgery could be ready as early as 2017.The procedure begins with doctors cooling the patient’s head and the donor’s body so their cells do not die during the operation. After the neck is cut through, major blood vessels are linked up using thin tubes, and the spinal cord cut cleanly with a sharp surgical knife to minimise nerve damage.The head is then moved on to the donor’s body, and the spinal cords can be fused together using polyethylene glycol to encourage the fat in cell membranes to mesh.Once the neck is sutured, the recipient will be kept in a coma for three or four weeks while implanted electrodes provide regular electrical stimulation to the spinal cord.Finally, when the patient wakes up from the coma, they will be able to feel their face and speak but will need a year of physiotherapy before they can walk.The first successful head transplant was carried out in 1970 by a team led by Robert White at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. The team transplanted the head of one monkey onto the body of another. They did not join the spinal cords, so the monkey was unable to move its body. But it was able to breathe with artificial assistance. The monkey died nine days later when its immune system rejected the head.Many neuroscientists are wary of the idea, calling it too outlandish to be a serious consideration and note there are many ethical implications related to the surgery.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Scientists find giant black hole weighing as much as 12 billion suns</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe discovery of a giant black hole which is growing faster than usual challenges our current theories of black hole expansion.Led by Xue-Bing Wu of China's Peking University, a team of scientists detected a giant black hole they have named SDSS J010013.021280225.8. Though it is not the biggest black hole ever found, it is the biggest one detected in terms of luminosity: 40,000 times more bright than our solar system, the Milky Way, said Avi Loeb, Chair of the Department of Astronomy of Harvard University in an interview with National Geographic. He was not involved in this research. Apart from its size, what is astonishing is that it was formed only 875 million years after the big banga relatively short period for a black hole to grow to such a massive size. Scientists are are not certain what accounts for the black hole’s rapid development, but one of the possibilities is that two black holes collided when the universe was very young.A black hole starts to form when the core of a dying star loses nuclear fuel, allowing gravity to overcome outward pressure. The core explodes and the star becomes a supernova.The black hole has such a powerful gravitational pull that nothing, including light, can escape. Yet, scientists can detect the existence of black holes from their quasars, a glow of radiating gas and matter. The black hole also absorbs other stars in its vicinity.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Nineteen manatees rescued from drainage pipe in Florida</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNineteen manatees were rescued early Tuesday morning from a storm drain at Satellite Beach, Florida. The manatees, also known as sea cows, were apparently trying to find their way to warmer waters when they became lodged in the drainage pipe, officials and local media said.Reuters reports the rescue started mid-afternoon on Monday when Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission biologist, Ann Spellman, sounded the alarm, according to Florida Today.Spellman told Florida Today that she had a hunch, which led city workers to check the 100-150-feet-long drain pipe.Although experts were able to coax some manatees to swim out of the pipe, video footage of the event shows the pipe also being cut and water being vacuumed from the area before manatees were hoisted out with heavy machinery and carried to a nearby canal in slings.Manatees, also known as sea cows, often leave the Indian River Lagoon during cold snaps for warmer waters in the canals. The ones that became stuck in the pipe probably followed ended up there by following each other, Reuters reports Spellman as saying.The rescue, which included local police working alongside experts from SeaWorld, was completed at about 2:00 a.m. local time (0100 ET), Satellite Beach Fire Department Captain Jay Dragon said.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Safety technology on new cars likely saved lives in California commuter train accident</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twSafety technology on passenger cars used by Metrolink since 2010 likely reduced casualties and saved lives in Tuesday’s commuter train accident in Southern California.The Los Angeles-bound commuter train derailed early Tuesday morning after it rammed into a tractor trailer that had stopped on the tracks in Oxnard, California, injuring at least 28 people, including four critically.Metrolink’s new cars have energy-absorbing zones in the front and rear. Pushback couplers and crushable compartments in these zones absorb and deflect energy away from passengers.The pushback coupler pushes back against an oncoming car. The crushable compartment then collapses, further dissipating energy from the impact.Additional safety features on the new cars include elevated train engineer compartments, illuminated pathways and exits and emergency pull-away windows.Metrolink spent $263 million on 137 new passenger cars built by South Korean company Hyundai Rotem after a similar accident in Glendale in 2005 killed 11 people and injured 180 others.

      <title>Miracle birth: Los Angeles baby born in intact amniotic sac</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA premature baby still inside its intact amniotic sac was delivered in January by a group of doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, a medical rarity that only happens once in every 80,000 deliveries.Chelsea Phillips underwent an emergency Cesarean section at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles earlier this year.The baby was born three months early, still in an undamaged amniotic sac. The sac is a tough membrane which protects the baby from injury. The fluid inside contains nutrients for the baby to grow. The baby was still absorbing oxygen through the placenta at the time of birth.“It was a moment that really did, even though its a cliche: we caught our breath. It really felt like a moment of awe,” William Binder, a neonatologist at the hospital, told CBS Los Angeles. “This was really a moment that will stick in my memory for some time.”Soon after the birth, a doctor punctured the sac with his fingers so that the baby could breathe on his own, SFGate reported. The mother was oblivious to the drama until she was shown a picture of her baby snapped by the doctor on his mobile phone hours after the delivery. The baby spent its first few weeks in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. The baby boy is now ten weeks old and is in good health.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twA CT-scan of an ancient Buddha statue has led to the unique discovery of a mummified Chinese monk, dating back to the 11th century and preserved in the same position as its exterior statue. The Buddha statue, which was on display at the Drents Museum in the Dutch city of Assen, was analyzed at the Meander Medical Center in Amersfoort.A team of scientists and doctors tested the statue using CT-scan imaging and an endoscope. Amsterdam resident Erik Bruijn headed the project, according to the NL Times online.  The mummified body has been identified as Master Liuquan, a Buddhist monk who likely practiced Sokushinbutsu, or self-mummification. Radiologist Ben Heggelman took bone samples to confirm the mummy’s identification with DNA testing. The statue, which is currently visiting Hungary, will be on display in Budapest until May 2015.

      <title>Carbon dioxide released by the ocean thousands of years ago may have ended the ice age</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twRecent research conducted by the University of Southampton and published in Nature magazine suggests that carbon dioxide released from the ocean played a large role in ending the most recent ice age.The studies were based on analyzing the calcium carbonate shells in plankton that lived in the ocean thousands of years ago. By examining the shells of microbes called foraminifera, which preserves the ratio of chemicals in seawater as they grow, researchers were able to determine the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon in ocean water thousands of years ago.  Research points to a huge, sudden rise in dissolved carbon concentrations in the surface water of the Atlantic Ocean and in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean at the end of the last ice age. This sudden rise in concentration corresponds to the simultaneously increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Based on these findings, scientists suggest that at that point in time, upwellings in the Southern Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Pacific Ocean occurred. This caused isolated reservoirs of cold, carbon-rich waters to churn up to the surface. There’s a high concentration of dissolved carbon at greater depths in the ocean because waste and decay fall to the bottom of the ocean and some of the carbon is further retained in calcium carbonate shells like those examined in this recent study. The upwelling reconnected large concentrations of carbon with the water surface where it readily transformed into carbon dioxide and was absorbed into the atmosphere. As a greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere absorbed solar energy and thereby warmed the atmosphere. As the oceans began to warm as a consequence,  the oceans are also unable to absorb as much atmospheric carbon dioxide and this continues to lead to an increasingly warm atmosphere. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Water deeper in the ocean contains more carbon2. Spots in the southern Atlantic Ocean and eastern Pacific Ocean3. Upwellings bring up carbon-rich waters from ocean depths4. Carbon released to atmosphere as carbon dioxide and warms atmosphere5. Glaciers begin to melt6. Warmer atmosphere causes warmer waters which causes more carbon dioxide releaseVOICEOVER (in English): The end of the last ice age might have been due to carbon dioxide.A recent study by the University of Southampton suggests that carbon dioxide released from the ocean helped end the last ice age.There is more carbon at lower depths in the ocean because of high amounts of detritus and the calcium carbonate shells of animals found at lower depths.According to research, upwellings probably occurred in the Southern Atlantic Ocean and the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Upwellings, which occur when offshore winds push surface water away from landmass, brings cold, carbon-rich waters to the surface.Carbon is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide absorbs solar energy and this causes the atmosphere to heat up.The warming atmosphere causes glaciers to melt.The warming atmosphere also warms the oceans. As oceans warm, they are less able to absorb carbon dioxide and this causes a rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Changes in the ocean’s carbon storage capabilities continues to be a factor in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration variations.SOURCES: BBC, Nature, Science Daily, Nature World Newshttp://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31424597http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7538/full/nature14155.htmlhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150211132019.htmhttp://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/12712/20150212/ocean-carbon-release-may-have-ended-last-ice-age.htm***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>Russian researchers expose breakthrough U.S. spying program</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twRussian security software maker Kaspersky Lab announced that a cyber espionage group, perhaps connected to the NSA, has developed a means to hide spying software within the hard drives of personal computers. Computers impacted include those manufactured by companies such as Western Digital and Seagate. The surveillance program is among several spy surveillance programs discovered by Kaspersky. Although Kaspersky did not say specifically who planted the software, they said the program is closely linked to Stuxnet, an NSA-related cyberweapon that was used to attack Iran’s uranium enrichment facility. The spies were able to access source codes for computer hard drives, allowing the attackers to better understand and control computer systems. According to unnamed former intelligence operators who spoke with Reuters, NSA employees may have obtained the source codes by posing as software developers and asking manufacturers directly for the information. Knowing the source code allowed access to the drive, and spies were able to place spyware into the firmware. The corrupted firmware runs each time a computer is turned on. Firmware loads all the low-level drivers that manage a computer’s interfaces such as keyboards and displays before an operating system such as Windows is booted.As the firmware helps to manage the computer’s operating system, the malware is able to access many of the computer’s folders, file-systems and operating system components. Viruses in the firmware are usually undetectable, and as a consequence are difficult to remove. The surveillance software has been found on computers in 30 countries worldwide. Iran, Russia, Afghanistan, China, Mali, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen and Algeria were particularly targeted. Institutions of interest included government and military organizations, energy companies, Islamic activists and the media. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. NSA receiving source codes for hard drives2.

Prior to the upgrade, the particles were accelerated at up to 8 trillion electron volts, producing the conditions that triggered the Higgs-Boson discovery in 2013.However the the accelerator has been shut down for the last 2 years for maintenance and overhauling. It has since been given superconducting magnets along with higher grade wiring able to to handle higher currents, giving it the ability to go up to and possibly beyond 13 trillion electron volts. This may open the door to discovering particles like the elusive Supersymmetry particle that is said to be the key to discovering dark matter.In addition to the power upgrades, significant upgrades have also been made to the  safety, cooling and computing infrastructure as well, such as adding over 100 petabytes of additional data storage to cope with the increased amount of data that is expected from the new experiments phase.RUNDOWN SHOWS:CERN supercollider in relation to France and Switzerland on map.Brief overview of how hydrogen atoms are stripped to only their protons.Current accelerator showing 8TeV power used to speed up protonsSuperconducting magnets being switched along with higher current connectionsFinal assembly with 13TeV of power for a 60% gainOverview of the system in action with Higgs-Boson and Supersymmetric particles highlighted.VOICEOVER (in English): “The European Organization for Nuclear Research or CERN, operates the Large Hadron Collider located 100 meters under the the Franco-Swiss border.”“The particle accelerator first strips hydrogen atoms of their neutrons and electrons, leaving only protons.” “Prior to the upgrade, the particles were accelerated at up to 8 trillion electron volts, producing the conditions that triggered the Higgs-Boson discovery in 2013.”“However in the recent months, the accelerator has been overhauled with superconducting magnets able to to handle higher currents, giving it the ability to go up to and possibly beyond 13 trillion electron volts, opening the possibility to discovering particles like the elusive Supersymmetry particle that is said to be the key to discovering dark matter.”SOURCES: CERN, FORBES http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/02/cerns-two-year-shutdown-drawing-closehttp://www.forbes.com/sites/bridaineparnell/2015/02/16/upgraded-atom-smasher-could-go-beyond-higgs-to-dark-matter-and-the-first-supersymmetry-particle/***For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twFor technical and editorial support, please contact:Asia: +61 2 93 73 1841Europe: +44 20 7542 7599Americas and Latam: +1 800 738 8377]]></description>

      <title>NASA proposes submarine mission to Saturn&#x2019;s moon Titan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twNASA is planning to send a submarine to Saturn’s largest moon by 2040 to study Titan’s hydrocarbon oceans. Titan is the only celestial body in the solar system other than Earth that is known to host liquid lakes and seas on its surface.Titan’s atmosphere is a mix of methane, nitrogen, and argon, and its surface has liquid methane oceans and lakes. Atmospheric pressure is 50 percent higher than Earth at sea level. The submarine will be carried to Titan by a spacecraft similar to the X-37 Orbital Test Vehicle. The spacecraft would decelerate on contact with Titan’s dense atmosphere and glide into Titan’s Kraken Mare, where the sub would be ejected from the spacecraft. The submarine’s radiothermal Sterling generator can propel the craft at about 4 kmph and generates heat to keep the craft from freezing in the liquid methane sea.The submarine will measure the alien sea’s chemistry, currents and tides, as well as hunt for evidence of organic life. At surface level the craft is able to transmit data directly back to Earth via its antenna.NASA hopes that by studying Titan’s Kraken Mare, the mission could reveal whether environmental conditions hospitable to life may be found on planets and moons outside our solar system.RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Scientists discover Earth&#x2019;s inner-inner core</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Scientists from China and United States have discovered that the Earth’s inner core has another core at its centre.A research team, led by University of Illinois geology professor Xiaodong Song, gathered readings of seismic waves that resonate in an earthquake’s aftermath to probe far below the Earth’s surface, the university said in a statement.The data show that the Earth’s inner core, which is about the size of the Moon, is in fact made up of two parts. Iron crystals in outer-inner core are aligned in a vertical manner from north to south, while those in the inner-inner core are aligned horizontally from east to west, according to the statement.“The fact that we have two regions that are distinctly different may tell us something about how the inner core has been evolving,” Song said in the statement. “For example, over the history of the earth, the inner core might have had a very dramatic change in its deformation regime. It might hold the key to how the planet has evolved. We are right in the center – literally, the center of the Earth.”RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Illustration of seismic waves2.

      <title>ESA set to test reusable spaceship on Wednesday</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twThe European Space Agency’s Vega rocket, which contains the agency’s Intermediate Experimental Vehicle, or IXV, is poised for liftoff this Wednesday. The aircraft will launch from Kourou, French Guiana at 13:00 GMT. After climbing 320 kilometers from Earth, IXV will completely separate from the Vega rocket. The unmanned spacecraft will continue to climb for several more kilometers before coasting in low orbit and initiating its descent back to Earth’s atmosphere. The aerodynamic shape of IXV provides the lift that flies the aircraft through space. IXV will propel itself back towards Earth with aerodynamic flaps and thrusters, and continue to collect data about its external conditions as it makes its way back to Earth’s surface. IXV will deploy parachutes to slow down its descent before landing in the Pacific Ocean. The entire mission will last 100 minutes. Reentering Earth’s atmosphere safely is still a major challenge for the aerospace industry as the friction created as a spacecraft reenters Earth’s atmosphere can heat the space vehicle up to extremely high degrees. ESA scientists hope that data collected from Wednesday’s test will bring them one step closer to creating reusable spacecrafts that can shuttle astronauts back and forth from space stations and return from missions to Mars. After NASA retired its Space Shuttle, the only remaining spacecraft that is able to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station is Russia’s Soyuz. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1.

      <title>Swedish office complex workers receive microchip implants</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RESTRICTIONS: NONE For story suggestions please contact tips@nma.com.twWorkers at the at the the high-tech Swedish firm are now using implanted radio-frequency identification microchips (RFID) chip in lieu of a personal identity card. The technology gives eligible employees at the Stockholm Epicenter building complex access through doors and to the building’s copy machines. BioNyfiken, a Swedish biohacking group, is responsible of developing and inserting the sub-dermal microchips. According to the group, the devices allow for quicker and more reliable authentication of Epicenter employees. Up to 400 workers will have the option to have one of the small chips inserted into their bodies. While employees can currently only access doors and photocopy machines with the implants, eventually, the microchips may be used to pay for food in the complex’s cafeteria as well as to grant access to private computers. The tiny capsule is inserted into the skin between the thumb and index finger using a special syringe. Along with a microchip, the capsule also contains a copper antenna coil, a capacitor and a bio-compatible casing made of either glass or polypropylene polymer. The capsule contains no internal power source and relies on a scanner to provide its charge. When the capsule passes over a scanner, the scanner sends out low-level radio waves. The capacitor next to the microchip sends these electrical currents to the microchip, which then retrieves its information. The microchip stores a unique binary number that acts as a long password. The microchip then uses the antenna to transmit this unique binary code to the scanner. BioNyfiken’s founder, Hannes Sjoblad, expects the technology to find an increasingly larger market with governments and large tech companies like Google and Facebook. He told the BBC the program underway at Epicenter is essentially preparing us all for a future in which routine implants may become a reality. RUNDOWN SHOWS:1. Man entering building with scanner2.
