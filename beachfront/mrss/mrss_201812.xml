      <title>Cat in China parking lot working towards washboard abs</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  A fluffy white cat in China was caught on camera in a parking lot trying to get swole.According to Next Shark, the ferocious feline workout took place on Nov. 22 in Beijing. In a clip posted to China's Twitter knockoff Weibo, the cat is seen chilling on the ground with his hind legs pushed up against the back of a car. The cat then proceeds to crank out sit-ups at a super speed, no doubt working toward a chiseled washboard.Unfortunately, the cat's killer set was interrupted when two men happened to walk by, startling the four-legged sit-up machine. The video of the jacked cat has since gone viral in Pandaland. Who knows what's next for the catmaybe arms or legs?]]></description>

      <title>Japan to put US F-35s on first aircraft carriers since WWII</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  Japan is planning to upgrade at least on of its ships to an aircraft carrier in preparation for a procurement of around 100 U.S. F-35 stealth fighter jets in order to counter Chinese military expansion in the Pacific.  According to the Guardian, Japan plans to upgrade its two Izumo-class helicopter carriers to transport and launch fighter jets.The Nikkei News Service reported that Japan was set to purchase 100 F-35s from the U.S. in a deal worth more than US$8.8 billion.According to CNN, the package includes F-35 A and B models. F-35As are similar to conventional fighter jets that use a runway for take off and landing. F-35Bs have short take-off and vertical landing capability, meaning they can be used at smaller airports or operate from flattop warships. Japan's Izumo-class carrier is 814 meters long and can carry up to 14 helicopters.According to former US Navy captain and current Hawaii Pacific University Professor Carl Schuster telling CNN, a refitted Japanese carrier would only be able to carry six to eight F-35Bs.     According to Mainichi Shimbun, the carriers would be used to defend Japan's remote south-western islands.]]></description>

      <title>Male birth control gel nearly
ready for clinical trials</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BETHESDA, MARYLAND  Scientists from the National Institutes of Health are set to trial an experimental male contraceptive that if successful, would fill an important public health need and pave the way for reproductive equality.According to a press release from the National Institutes of Health, NES/T is a contraceptive gel whose primary compound is the progestin hormone Nestorone, which blocks natural testosterone production in the testes. This decreases sperm production to low or nonexistent levels to prevent conception.The gel also contains a concentration of testosterone to maintain blood levels of the hormone, in order to ensure a normal sex drive and other functions.The clear gel is applied daily to the back and shoulders, and absorbed through the skin.To test its efficacy, NIH researchers will study 420 couples for a year. The men will be tracked for up to 16 weeks to ensure sperm levels have declined, with women using an alternative form of birth control. Couples will then use the gel as the sole method of contraception for 52 weeks, to see if it does prevent pregnancy.After the trials, male participants will be observed for several more weeks to check for any after effects, and make sure sperm production returns to normal.Results from the trial are expected in 2022. If successful, it will need to be evaluated in a larger trial before it can obtain FDA approval and be available commercially.]]></description>

      <title>Traces of poo found in McDonald's touch screens in the UK</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  You might want to think twice before you order off a touch screen kiosk, seeing as how most of 'em are covered in nasty gunk.A Metro UK investigation swabbed Mickey D's touch screens from eight stores in London and Birmingham, and found a treasure trove of bad bacteria and traces of poo.Bacteria may be everywhere, but with the amount of gut and fecal bacteria on those kiosks, they might as well have been in a hospital. These germs are extra-bad too: staphylococcus, proteus, even listeria.It takes just one sick, germy mofo to contaminate a screen and god knows what else.Before long, you've got diners going straight from screen to table and getting infected with dangerous diseases.McDonald's claims the self-order screens are cleaned frequently throughout the day, though clearly whatever's being done isn't enough. They could put a hand sanitizer or two by the screens, but really, people need to be washing their hands before they eat.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists suggest more brown 
fat could help fight obesity</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM   Scientists are studying a molecule that might help us burn 'bad' fat.Humans have two types of fat, white and brown. White fat stores energy and acts as a thermal insulator. However, excessive amounts could lead to diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancer. Brown fat, on the other hand, burns calories to generate heat.   Scientists from the University of Cambridge detected a molecule in mice called BMP8b. This protein controls the activation of brown fat in the brain and body tissue of mice. According to their study published in the journal Nature, they analyzed mice that had been bred to produce higher levels of the molecule in fat tissue. Researchers discovered that increased levels of the protein caused white fat to become beige  or turn brown burning more calories and generating more energy as a result. They concluded that it could be possible to create a drug that alters fat function in humans just as the BMP8b protein does in mice. But until that happens, you better hop on that treadmill and start working those brown fat cells yourselves.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists find bacteria that dines on harmful greenhouse gases</title>
      <description><![CDATA[#Science #Oceans #BacteriaAUSTIN, TEXAS  Scientists have found several new types of sea-borne microbes that could eat oil and other pollutants.Some of the newly discovered species use hydrocarbons, such as methane and butane, as energy sources, according to a University of Texas at Austin news release.The researchers used the Alvin deep-sea submersible and collected 551 genomes. As many as 22 of those were said to be new species.The microbes found within the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. They were living in hot, deep-sea sediments located 2,000 meters below the surface. Temperatures can rise up to 200 degrees Celsius at this depth due to volcanic activity.Brett Baker, a scientist involved in the research, explained there are huge reservoirs of hydrocarbon gases under the ocean floor. He explained these microbes help prevent greenhouse gases from being released into the atmosphere. Baker added that there is much-unexplored biodiversity in the deep oceans.]]></description>

      <title>Creative cops stop snoozing Tesla driver on autopilot</title>
      <description><![CDATA[REDWOOD CITY, CALIFORNIA  Police in Northern California busted a man for sleeping behind the wheel of his Tesla Model S while it was cruising down the highway on autopilot.California Highway Patrol Officer Art Montiel told Business Insider that po po initially spotted the luxury electric sedan zipping southbound down Highway 101 around 3:40 a.m., last Friday night. Cops became fishy after the driver failed to respond to lights and sirens. That's probably because 45-year-old driver Alexander Samek was out like a light.The authorities were then forced to get creative by having a few patrol officers block traffic behind the Model S, while another officer drove ahead and got in front of the Tesla. The officer in front then gradually slowed down, forcing the Tesla autopilot to kick in and slow down as well. After the cops got the Model S to come to a complete stop, they had to get out and knock Samek's window to wake him up. He was busted on suspicion of DUI and placed in a patrol car, while another officer drove his Tesla to a nearby gas station. Thanks to the quick thinking California Highway Patrol no one was hurt in the incident.]]></description>

      <title>UK couple to get back lost engagement ring thanks to NYPD</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  The NYPD went the extra mile, in this case below ground, to find an engagement ring that accidentally fell down a sewer grate.According to the New York Times, UK-based lovebirds John Drennan and Daniella Anthony had just gotten engaged in Central Park on Friday when disaster struck just a few hours later.While strolling around Times Square later that night, Anthony's diamond ring slipped off her finger and fell straight into a sidewalk grate.The unlucky couple tried to get back the ring on their own before asking some officers for help. But when it still hadn't been found an hour later, they left without leaving their names.Two cops returned the next morning, descending into the muck below to continue the search. It didn't take long before they spotted the glittering rock.NYPD turned to Twitter to help find the couple, who by then had gone back home to the UK and even gotten a replacement ring. By Sunday, New York's finest announced that they'd found the pair, and are making arrangements to reunite them with their ring.Seeing as how New York City sewer grates are a graveyard of lost items, it's a miracle and a half that this couple got their ring back. Definitely a story to tell the grandkids.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[HONGCHEON, SOUTH KOREA  While most people take great pains to get away from prison, overworked South Koreans are actually paying to get into solitary confinement.According to a Reuters report, the average person in South Korea worked about 2,024 hours in 2017  the third longest in a survey of 36 OECD countries.To seek relief, overworked South Koreans are paying $90 to stay in a mock prison in Hongcheon, where they spend 24 hours locked up in solitary confinement.Clients sleep on the floor of a spartan 54-square-foot cell, which has a small toilet, but no clock or mirror. They wear blue prison uniforms and given accommodation kits with a yoga mat, tea set, pen and notebook.Speaking to each other is forbidden, as is the use of mobile phones. Meals are fed through a slot in the door, and consist of steamed sweet potato and a banana shake for dinner, and rice porridge for breakfast.The 'Prison Inside Me' facility has been open for five years, and has hosted over 2,000 'inmates.' Founder Noh Ji-Hyang claims she was inspired her prosecutor husband, who worked 100-hour work weeks.She says people are wary of paying to stay in a prison cell until they actually do it and realize the real prison is the one outside.]]></description>

      <title>Congo sees second deadliest Ebola outbreak in history</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CONGO    According to local health authorities, there are now 426 cases of Ebola in eastern Congo.Reports by the World Health Organization show there are a total of 14 health zones with confirmed and probable cases of Ebola virus disease in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The Ebola virus is transferred to humans through contact with fluids of dead wild animals that are hosts to the virus. The virus can then be transmitted among the human population through direct contact with contaminated body fluids such as sweat, saliva, blood and sexual fluids.It takes the virus up to 21 days to incubate. Muscle pain, fever, weakness and headaches are among the first symptoms. As the disease advances, symptoms can include vomiting, rash and bleeding from eyes and gums.WHO authorities stated that there is a very high chance of the outbreak spreading to areas surrounding North Kivu and Ituri, as well as to neighboring countries.Local health workers and health organizations on site are doing their best to contain the virus through vaccination, community engagement and by practicing safe burials of contagious bodies.CBC reports there are 300 WHO specialists in the area, and more than 37,000 people have received Ebola vaccinations.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[KALIMPONG, INDIA  A paragliding pilot heroically saved the life of a tourist after their paraglider snapped mid-flight.According to Next Shark, 32-year-old tourist Gaurav Choudhary was enjoying his paragliding flight, capturing the experience with a selfie stick. According to the Times of India, 22-year-old pilot Purushottam Timsina and Choudhary were making their way down for a landing.Witnesses said they saw the pilot try a complicated maneuver when a part of the glider tore off. Choudhary's video captures the moment the pair start plummeting toward the ground after a harness strap breaks mid-air. The footage shows the pilot grabbing hold of Choudhary as they spin out of control from hundreds of feet up in the air. The two end up getting tangled in some pine trees before crash-landing on the roof of a house. Unfortunately, the pilot didn't make it. Choudhary was also pretty banged up suffering a broken leg and is now recovering in the hospital. Paragliding activities have been suspended for the moment in Kalimpong as authorities conduct an investigation into the incident.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. army developing exoskeletons for tomorrow's soldiers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The U.S. army is developing exoskeleton technology to make soldiers deployed out in the battlefield stronger and more resilient. The exoskeleton is being developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation with a license from Canada-based B-TEMIA, which first developed the technology to help people suffering from medical related mobility issues, according to Reuters. The battery-operated exoskeleton is worn over a soldier's pants and uses sensors, artificial intelligence and other technology to aid in natural movements. Modern U.S. soldiers are now deployed into war zones carrying anywhere from 90 to 140 pounds of critical gear, including body armor, night-vision goggles and advanced radios, while the recommended limit is only 50 pounds. The goal of the exoskeleton would be to lighten the load soldiers must carry, so when they arrive at the battlefield, they aren't excessively fatigued.  According to Reuters, Lockheed Martin said last Thursday it was awarded a two-year $6.9 million contract from the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center to research and develop the ONYX exoskeleton.Keith Maxwell, the exoskeleton technologies manager at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, told Reuters that each exoskeleton is expected to cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.]]></description>

      <title>Alaskan oil drilling gets fast-tracked by Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALASKA  One of the wildest and most pristine places on Earth is about to be sacrificed on the altar of American greed, courtesy of Big Oil and Orangina in the White House.National Geographic reports that when Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1980, Congress deferred a decision to manage 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain, which the USGS estimates to contain 10.4 billion barrels of oil.For decades, opposition to drilling helped keep the refuge off limits. But Trump and the Republicans are now paving the way for oil exploration.The New York Times reports that in 2017, a provision to allow for drilling in the Arctic refuge was inserted into a tax bill that was approved by the Senate and signed into law by the President. The provision authorized two lease sales of drilling rights for 400,000 acres each.Drilling plans are overseen by officials committed to oil exploration. Opponents fear the process may not be impartial, especially with speedy and less rigorous environmental impact assessments.Environmentalists are also concerned that seismic testing and eventual drilling in the refuge could threaten wildlife, including crucial habitats for caribou and polar bears.Actual drilling may be a long way off, but if oil companies get their claws on the leases before the 2020 elections, it'll be difficult to stop drilling plans even if a Democrat takes back the White House.Still, environmental groups are keeping a close eye on the proceedings. House Democrats are also promising to use their oversight powers on the leasing process.]]></description>

      <title>Drought forces El Paso residents to drink treated sewage water</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EL PASO, TEXAS  Drought caused by climate change is forcing El Paso residents to find alternate sources of water.The city used to get most of its water from the Rio Grande which, due to rising temperatures, has been drying up, reports CNN.Scientists say the river used to receive additional water in the form of runoff and snowmelt 20 to 30 years ago.Residents have already reduced their daily water consumption by more than 35 percent since 1985, according to CNN.El Paso is now looking to become one of the first cities in the U.S. to treat sewage water and turn it into drinking water.The city is working to build a closed loop facility to treat the sewage water with multiple steps of filtration such as carbon and UV filtration to make sure there are no pathogens or microbes present.Gilbert Trejo, the chief technical officer of El Paso Water, told CNN technology helps the water be 'treated to a very high standard' making it safe to drink.El Paso also plans to use other techniques such as desalination to produce more drinkable water.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[UK  According to The Daily Mail, smartphones are home to seven times the amount of bacteria found in toilet seats.Initial Washroom Hygiene  a company dedicated to health and safety   took samples of bacteria from 50 smartphones using a special device that detects and lights up germs on surfaces.The findings were, well, disgusting. A scan on a toilet seat revealed 220 bright spots. A smartphone? 1479. Phones with leather cases which are often used as wallets showed the highest count of bacteria  almost 17 times more germs and bacteria than an average toilet seat. British consumer goods company, Which?, carried out a similar study back in 2013, their results were also shocking.

      <title>Saudi crown prince sent messages to aide during Khashoggi killing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ISTANBUL  The CIA has evidence of multiple messages between the Saudi crown prince and the adviser who oversaw the Khashoggi assassination  bolstering the agency's assessment that the prince masterminded the murder.The Washington Post reports that according to a leaked CIA report, Prince Mohammed bin Salman sent at least 11 messages to a close personal aide before and after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The aide, Saud Al-Qahtani, reportedly supervised the 15-man team that killed Khashoggi on October 2, and communicated directly with the team's leader Maher Mutreb in Istanbul.According to the New York Times, Turkish intelligence recorded Mutreb on a phone call, saying 'tell your boss' that the mission had been carried out. It's believed he was talking to Qahtani.In communications intercepted by the U.S. intelligence community in August 2017, the prince told associates that if Khashoggi could not be persuaded to return to Saudi Arabia, they could lure him outside the country and make arrangements.The content and form of the prince's messages to Qahtani are unknown, and there's currently no evidence irrefutably linking him to the killing.Despite this, this, the CIA believes such an operation would not have been possible without his awareness or involvement. And unless more evidence surfaces, it's the closest they have to a smoking gun.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA  A poor Pennsylvania dude quite literally got the life squeezed out of him after being sat on by his plus-sized girlfriend.Windi Thomas was already pretty lit when she and boyfriend Keeno Butler began fighting inside their Erie apartment.According to YourErie, the 44-year-old stabbed him in the hand and beat him with a table leg before plopping herself on top and smothering his face with her stomach fat. With 300 pounds of body blocking his airways, the 120-pound Butler didn't stand a chance.Thomas called 911 afterwards and screamed that she killed her boyfriend. When cops got there, they found the three murder weapons: bloody table leg, knife, and Thomas herself.Thomas' defense attorney contends the killing wasn't intentional, and that actual cause of death was suffocation as a result of her collapsing on him, reports the Associated Press.But given the stabbing and violent beating on top of that, Thomas could be looking at up to 40 years in the slammer.]]></description>

He also didn't hydrate enough.Back in June, Zhou felt a painful bulge in his lower abdomen, and found it difficult to pee, so he decided to get medical help.Doctors at a local hospital found a huge mass as big as an ostrich egg lodged inside his bladder, and recommended immediate surgery.The giant stone was fished out during the open cystostomy and later shown to their maker, who will probably think twice before he holds in his pee again.At 13 centimeters long and weighing nearly a kilo, the hospital said it's the biggest they've ever removed.]]></description>

And thanks to a Col Condron and his phone across the streetit was all captured on camera.  Talking to the Manchester Evening News, Condron said the two men were tasked with constructing a fence around a house, so they parked their white work van on the driveway.And then they totally forgot about it and got down to work, putting in a bunch of posts and concrete paneling.After the Da Vincis fenced themselves in, they realized their boneheaded mistake. But only after they fenced themselves in.  According to Condron, they had to spend half an hour taking the fence down, so they could get the van out. After that mission was accomplished, they put the fence back up again.]]></description>

      <title>Denmark to isolate unwanted migrants on remote island</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COPENHAGEN  The Danish government plans to banish migrant criminals to a remote island in an inlet of the Baltic Sea. According to the New York Times, up to 100 foreign criminals and rejected asylum seekers living in Denmark who cannot be deported for legal reasons will be sent to a 17-acre island called Lindholm about three kilometers away from the mainland. Ferry services would allow the foreigners to leave the island. However, they would not operate around the clock and migrants would have to be back in the island before nightfall.Lindholm Island currently hosts a research center for contagious animal diseases.  The plan was developed between Denmark's conservative coalition government and the right-wing Danish People's Party, whose support the government needs to pass legislation. The Danish People's Party celebrated the plan by posting a video on Twitter showing a brown man dressed in generic Middle Eastern clothes being dumped on the island.The Danish government will invest US$115 million in migrant housing facilities in Lindholm Island, which are projected to open in 2021.The rising number of migrants coming from the Middle East has divided Denmark. In August hundreds took to the streets to protest after the government enacted what is known as the "burka ban."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  Scientists have combined two experimental cancer drugs to treat melanoma.As part of a study published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, researchers paired protein kinase inhibitors and ribonuclease before releasing them onto cancerous tumors.The protein kinases inhibitors work to bind and block the functions of enzymes that have been affected by cancer cells. This slows the spread of the disease. The ribonuclease then works to enter the tumor and destroy its RNA.The study found that the drug combination worked more effectively to treat melanoma than individual treatments of each drug.]]></description>

      <title>Passengers bake in scorching heat on Russian flight from hell</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NOVOSIBIRSK, RUSSIA  Passengers on a Russian flight endured sauna-like temperatures after the plane's ac malfunctioned. Talk about a flight from hell.One traveler told Ren TV that when he boarded the Siberian Airlines S7 plane in Novosibirsk, the air from the ventilation system was hot. He complained to a flight attendant, but was assured everything would be alright.The plane stayed on the tarmac for 30 more minutes, hot air blowing the entire time. Even worse was when the cabin started to smell like burning wires.Cool air finally began to circulate after take-off, but it didn't last long. Pretty soon, passengers were back to baking as inside temps got up to 122 degrees Fahrenheit.Two women got sick on the flight and had to be moved to the cabin crew area where it was cooler.The boiling heat in the cabin continued for the remainder of the two-hour flight to Yekaterinburg, which passengers say was the worst flight of their lives.S7 hasn't revealed what went wrong with the aircraft, but a spokesperson claims its currently being investigated.]]></description>

      <title>Facebook accused of using user data to reward and punish rivals</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  Facebook is under scrutiny yet again for claims of user data misuse.This time it's been found using access to user information as a way to reward companies that bring in the dollah bills and restricting access to competitors.The information comes from documents released by a U.K. parliamentary committee that's currently researching the role of social media in the spread of fake news.    The 250-page report details which companies got VIP access to user data goodies. According to the documents, Netflix, AirBnB and Lyft were all among Facebook's white-listed companies. Of course, you've got to be on Facebook's good sideAKA reign in the big ad bucksfor them to share their user data with you.Back in 2013, when video sharing app Vine was booming, Facebook Vice-president Justin Osofsky, e-mailed human android, Mark Zuckerberg, saying that 'if there were no objections' he would shut down Vine's friend access. Mark's reply? 'Yup, go for it.' Meanwhile, Facebook has issued a response on its platform claiming these 'whitelists' were developed for beta-testing features and preventing random apps from requesting permission to access user information. The Zuck posted on his own wall as well, saying these were all efforts done to prevent abusive apps from mis-using user information.He closed his statement saying 'this was an important change to protect our community, and it achieved its goal', should we believe him?]]></description>

      <title>Cancer immunotherapy duo win 2018 Nobel Prize for Medicine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN  The 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their work in harnessing the body's immune system to fight against cancer. Allison and Honjo established a link between immunotherapy and cancer treatment by identifying how the different cells interact with each other. According to the Conversation, Allison and Honjo were able to identify certain pathways, called "immune checkpoints," that actively stop immune cells from attacking cancerous tumors. These pathways inhibit the body's T-cellswhite blood cells that destroy infected cells and tumor cellsand prevent them from locating and attacking tumors. Allison and Honjo identified two separate proteins located on the surface of T-cells, CTLA-4 and PD-1, that interact with tumor cell proteins causing T-cells to not attack the tumor. Allison and Honjo's research led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies that block the regulatory pathways controlled by CTLA-4 and PD-1. These drugs attach to the CTLA-4 and PD-1 proteins and prevent them from turning off the T-cells. With some cancers, these new drugs have led to significant tumor regressions. The FDA has approved their use for several advanced cancers such as: metastatic melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer head and neck cancers and other tumors.   However, there can be significant risks as well. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause damaging inflammation in the skin, gut, heart, lungs and other vital organs. In addition, the long-term effects of the new drugs are also currently unknown.]]></description>

      <title>Japan is handing out abandoned houses for free</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JAPAN  Japan is giving away 10 million abandoned houses at a heavily discounted price, some even for free.These houses are called "Akiya" in Japanese which means "empty house."Many of them are associated with suicide, murder, or even "lonely deaths," reports Insider.The houses are mainly located in rural areas or suburbs which most Japanese people moved out of due to the changing demographics.These houses are also prone to vandalism and pests, and could collapse any minute.The "Akiya" program is aimed at those who want to own a house or those who want to invest in property.The Japanese government is offering subsidies, mainly aimed at people under the age of 43, to those willing to purchase and renovate these houses, according to Rethink Tokyo.Still, there's a deep social stigma attached to "Akiya" houses in Japan, with most avoiding it due to bad luck or because they don't want to be seen as a "social failure."]]></description>

      <title>Wild boar needs help while
crossing glass bridge in China</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUANGDONG, CHINA A wild boar in Guangdong China was hiking around Qingyuan Gulong Canyon when he spotted a magnificent glass bridge.The bridge opened in June and is famous for its large circular glass observation deck suspended at the end of the bridge, standing 72 meters from the cliff edge.   The wild boar deemed himself brave enough to cross the vertigo-inducing glass-bottom bridge only to find out that... Well, he wasn't. The terrified piggy clawed and slipped his way across the dew-covered bridge only to freeze in fear half-way through.But our wild friend was in luck.  Safety guards nearby took notice of his plight and  armed with brooms to wipe off the dew  went to the boar's rescue. After the pig-curling competition ended, the boar went back to safety in the nearby woods.The guards claim it is not uncommon to see boars roaming around the forests close to the bridge, however it seems it's the first pig-rescue they have carried out. This poor boar would've definitely appreciated a piggy-back ride!]]></description>

      <title>Flat Earther reneges on his $100,000 challenge offer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NOT ROUND EARTH  A YouTuber going by the name Flat Out Hero offered $100,000 to anyone who could prove the earth isn't flatsomeone did, now he's refusing to shell out the cash. In a video posted to YouTube, Flat Out Hero challenged anyone to navigate a plane using flight charts from Point A to Point B, Point B to Point C, and then Point C back to Point A, making only 90 degree turns and flying the exact distance between each point. Thank the Flat Earth Gods because YouTuber Wolfie6020 accepted said challenge.In a video called This Flat Earther Owes Me $100,000 posted in October, Wolfie shared his flight path, which checked all the boxes for the requirements. Flat Out Hero was not impressed. He shot a video response back saying he hadn't intended the word "chart" to be used as a verb. Also because Wolfie had used electronic flight charts to plot his route, Flat Out said he would have to map the path out again on paper. Since then, Wolfie has complete the challenge 3 times, 2 using electronic flight charts and 1 time using paper flight charts. Drawing a 2D triangle on a piece of paper with three 90-degree angles is impossible.However, when putting that triangle on a 3D sphere, three 90-degree angles with three equal sides is entirely possibleshhh, don't tell Flat Out.]]></description>

      <title>Wanted man sets romantic date
with police to turn himself in</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RICHLAND, WASHINGTON   A modern police persecution/love story.A wanted Washington man and local police had a comical on-again, off-again on-line persecution until the man willingly turned himself in. This modern love story began when the Richland Police Department made a 'Wanted Wednesday' post on Facebook calling out 38-year-old Anthony Ackers for failure to comply.To their surprise, Ackers himself replied to the post writing, 'Calm down, I'm going to turn myself in' causing a large reaction from social media followers. However, Ackers didn't seem keen on following up with his promise. He didn't show up. Cops waited all day not willing to accept they had been stood up, so they hopped back on FB in search of their boo.The po po offered their date a free ride saying 'Of course if you need a ride you can call non-emergency and we will pick you up'.Ackers  although thankful  declined the offer but promised the police he'd be there in two days. Yeah. He didn't show up. Typical.He apologized. Again. Even called them 'beautiful', psh. But the boys in blue were now rightfully doubtful of his intentions.A week later, Akers finally showed up. He even took a selfie on his way to meet his online pals, sharing it on Facebook with the caption 'Here for our date, sweetheart'.Whatever happens, we believe the cops deserve someone who can commit.]]></description>

      <title>Southwest flight skids off runway at Hollywood Burbank Airport</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BURBANK, CALIFORNIA  A Southwest flight skidded off the end of a runway at Hollywood Burbank Airport due to wet conditions on Thursday morning.According to an FAA spokesman, Southwest Flight 278 rolled off the end of runway 8 while landing shortly after 9 a.m. The plane came to a stop in an area called the Engineered Material Arresting System. The system is designed to stop planes quickly that go off the end of the runway. When the aircraft wheels roll over the soft material, they sink into it causing the plane to come to a stop. The flight left Oakland around 8 a.m. carrying 112 passengers and five crew members. Luckily, no injuries were reported. According to ABC 7, passenger Moe Storch tweeted that the plane hydroplaned after landing due to a wet runway, but that the pilot quickly regained control and hit the brakes and reverse thrust just in time. The passengers used stairs to get off the plane and were transported to the terminal by bus. The runway was set to reopen once the plane was removed and the debris cleaned up.]]></description>

      <title>Greenland meltwater causing
increase in sea level rise rate</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GREENLAND   Ice melting from Greenland's ice sheets may cause a rapid increase in sea levels.It's no surprise that humankind is running against the climate-change clock, but dire changes may come sooner than expected.Ice sheets in Greenland are melting at an unprecedented rate. The most comprehensive study of the subject ever has found levels of meltwater from the Arctic island are 50 percent higher than during pre-industrial levels.According to a paper published in the journal Nature, researchers extracted ice core data in order to examine rates of surface melt and run-off in Greenland.    Ice cores are long tubes of ice and snow samples drilled from an ice-sheet or glacier. Each layer contains key climate information including changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and climate stability.The data examined goes back 339 years. The first signs of meltwater date back to the mid-1800s, coinciding with the beginning of the industrial revolution."  Data from the research revealed Greenland's ice sheets are melting more quickly than they ever have in the last 350 years.According to data from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, meltwater from Greenland contributes to roughly 20 percent of the world's sea-level rise.  If all the ice in Greenland melted, sea levels would rise by seven meters. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that global sea levels are rising at an increasing rate. At the moment, sea levels are rising at a rate of 0.32 centimeters per year.]]></description>

      <title>Asian American group boots comedian for 'offensive' joke</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  Former SNL writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was actually booted off stage by offended event organizers for telling a gay black guy joke. According to the Columbia Spectator, the 32-year-old comedian was invited to perform at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event organized by the Columbia University Asian American Alliance last Friday night. During his set about living in the Big Apple, he told a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood, which AAA officials deemed inappropriate. Patel joked that being gay cannot be a choice because "no one looks in the mirror and thinks, 'this black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it."About half an hour in, some AAA members interrupted Patel's set and complained about his jokes on racial identities and sexual orientation, and gave him some time to wrap it up. Patel replied to the remarks saying that none of what he said was offensive, and he was just exposing the audience to things you might see "in the real world." The open-minded college students were having none of that and cut Patel's mic before he could finish talking. After that, Patel just walked off stage. AAA released a statement on Dec. 3 saying that while they acknowledge that discomfort and safety can co-exist, the discomfort Patel caused with his remarks and overall performance opposed AAA and cultureSHOCK's mission to celebrate, empower, and explore identity in a safe space.]]></description>

      <title>Satellite images show North Korea expanding missile bases</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NORTH KOREA  New images reveal North Korea has been expanding a key missile base, despite pledging toward denuclearization during the historic summit with Trump last June.CNN reports that the Hermit Kingdom's recent lack of ballistic missile testing has been touted as a sign of progress by the Trump administration, but this new evidence suggests Washington and Pyongyang may not be on the same page.Satellite images obtained by CNN from the Middelbury Institute of International Studies at Monterey reveal that North Korea has continued to upgrade the Yeongjeo-dong missile base in the mountainous north and built up another facility seven miles away that hadn't been previously publicly identified.The images indicate that the large underground facility was being built in 2017, and remained under construction as of August 2018.Experts believe the site's unique location makes it a strong candidate to house the country's newest long-range missiles, including those capable of holding a nuclear warhead and striking the U.S.A Middlebury researcher told NPR that hardened drive-thru shelters are being constructed for the vehicles that would carry the missiles. Tunnel entrances are also being built.In the event of an attack, mobile missile launchers can be fueled and armed in the underground facility, and then driven to predetermined sites to fire missiles at the enemy.]]></description>

      <title>Beijing wants to banish Chingrish before 2022 Winter Olympics</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  As China prepares to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, one goals is to clean up Beijing's ubiquitous Chingrish signs. Some also pronounce the term as Chinglish, but true purists know how hard those "L's" can be for Asians, hence Chingrish.Anyways, these English mistranslations can be found littered throughout the city in all types of public spaces and tourist attractions. According to the Shanghaiist, a new English translation standard went into effect on Dec. 1, 2017. Beijing's foreign affairs office says its examined more than 2 million Chinese characters on bilingual signs and deemed them to be Chingrish-free. In April of this year, the government even launched a website to get locals to help in the clean up effort. Asking Chinese people in China to help correct English signs? That must have worked fabulously.    According to China's Standardization Administration and General Administration of Quality Supervision, having proper signs will repair the country's image that may have been damaged by the mistranslated signs. Yeahthat's probably the only thing damaging China's amazing image.]]></description>

      <title>Woman dies from brain-eating amoebas after using neti pot</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  A 69-year-old Seattle woman is no longer around after developing rare brain-eating amoebas.According to the Seattle Times, the woman was admitted into the Swedish Medical Center emergency room in January after suffering a seizure. After conducting a CT scan of her brain, doctors discovered something in her brain, which they initially thought was a tumor. During her brain surgery the next day, a tissue sample revealed her brain had been under attack from brain-eating amoebas for about a year. According to Dr. Charles Cobbs, a neurosurgeon at Swedish, during a phone interview with the Seattle Times, "there were these amoebas all over the place just eating brain cells. We didn't have any clue what was going on, but when we got the actual tissue we could see it was the amoeba."The woman unfortunately passed away a month later. Doctors think the rare organisms enter her brain after the woman had used a neti pot to clean out her sinuses. This is because the woman used regular tap water in her neti pot, instead of using distilled, sterile or boiled water as health experts suggest. According to ABC 11, tap water can contain tiny organisms that are safe to drink but can survive in your nasal passages. These type of infections are extremely rare, with only three cases occurring in the U.S. from 2008 to 2017.]]></description>

      <title>Dog survives wildfire, guards burned down home for a month</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PARADISE, CALIFORNIA  A loyal dog that survived the deadly wildfire in northern California protected the ruins of his home for a month until his owner returned.The Associated Press reports that after the massive Camp Fire broke out on November 8, Andrea Gaylord was forced to leave her Paradise home without her dogs Madison and Miguel.Believing her fur babies survived the catastrophic blaze, she connected with animal rescue volunteer Shayla Sullivan to help check if they were alright.Sullivan spotted Madison at Gaylord's burned down property. But since the Anatolian Shepherd mix was apprehensive and kept his distance, she supplied him with food and water instead. She also helped get back Madison's brother Miguel from a shelter in Citrus Heights, some 85 miles away.Once the evacuation order was lifted nearly a month later, Gaylord and Miguel finally got to go back and reunite with Madison.The family may have lost their home in the fire, but at least now they're all back together.Sullivan has also helped set up a GoFundMe page to help get them back on their feet.]]></description>

      <title>US threatens to withdraw from the INF treaty over Russian cheating</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The U.S. has threatened to withdraw from the INF nuclear weapons treaty if Russia doesn't adhere to the agreement, the Washington Post reports. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, was signed between the former Soviet Union and the U.S. 30 years ago.The treaty banned the use of nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.The INF Treaty helped to eliminate more than 2,600 missiles and helped to end the Cold War.The U.S. claims Russia has violated the treaty by developing and deploying a new ground-launched cruise missile.The U.S. also claims the treaty puts America at a disadvantage with China, which didn't sign the INF Treaty in 1987.The U.S. has officially given Russia 60 days, starting from Dec. 4, to abide by the treaty, or else it will withdraw from it.]]></description>

      <title>US and Russia join Saudi Arabia
to weaken key climate report</title>
      <description><![CDATA[POLAND  The four oil thirsty countries stand together...against climate change.In October, a climate change report by the U.N's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned governments around the world of the imminent consequences of climate change asking them to take urgent action.According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Earth's temperature risks crossing the 1.5 Celsius threshold by 2030, which would bring about droughts, floods, and extreme heat.The report states that pollution caused by greenhouse gases needs to be cut by 45 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050 in order to prevent a rise in temperature.  This report is being discussed as part of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Katowice, Poland.According to Reuters, the main goal is for world leaders to develop a rulebook detailing regulations to decelerate climate change in order to meet the Paris agreement goals.However, during discussions held at the conference, the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait rejected the IPCC climate change report.US authorities claimed data from the report should be 'noted' not 'welcome.'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia said they hoped the IPCC would address the 'gaps and challenges' in the report.According to Reuters, parties were unable to reach an agreement due to lack of consensus.According to The Guardian, climate campaigners believe the oil allies were being driven by fuel interests and were attempting to 'sideline the study.']]></description>

      <title>Tesla saves Australia millions with world's largest battery</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JAMESTOWN, AUSTRALIA  The world's largest lithium-ion battery may have cost a pretty penny, but it's already exceeding expectations in just its first year of operation.The Guardian reports that the Hornsdale Power Reserve consists of a 100-megawatt, lithium-ion battery built by Tesla and paired with the Hornsdale Wind Farm near Jamestown in South Australia.The battery is comprised of several hundred PowerPack towers which store renewable energy generated by the wind turbines. It can power 30,000 homes during peak usage hours as well as provide back-up power if there is a shortfall.Consultancy firm Aurecon evaluated the reserve and found that since its December 2017 launch, it has helped stabilize the grid, avoid outages, and reduce costs by almost $28.9 million.The battery is estimated to have cost about $65 million, according to News.com.au, but it not might be long before it pretty much pays for itself.According to the government of South Australia, Tesla has also been working to build a giant virtual power plant in the region, aiming to install rooftop solar panel systems and Powerwall-2 batteries in 50,000 homes over the next four years. According to Electrek, the first 100 Powerwalls were deployed in July, and will soon be expanding to 1,000 homes as part of the second phase.The equipment will generate power and provide electricity for each home, while collectively forming a virtual power plant with a 250-megawatt capacity. Any excess energy feeds into the main power grid, to be used to supply electricity to other homes, or during an emergency.Looks like South Australians are in for some electrifying new developments.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CRANSTON, RHODE ISLAND  The Cranston School District was crunching numbers when they realized they were $45,859 short in lunch money. Looks like some parents weren't shelling out the cash, leaving Cranston officials less than pleased. According to NBC 10 News, the school had already racked up $95,508 in unpaid lunch money in previous years and wasn't looking for a repeat.So they decided to go straight gangster. They went full Don Corleone on the parents and hired a collection agency to help get their money.The school announced that the collection agency, Transworld Systems, would begin collecting the Benjamins starting January 2019. It's not as hardcore as it sounds, they will be doing so via email. Boring.However, the school promised the kids would still be fed, even if their parents don't pay the bills.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHANGHUA, TAIWAN  A Taiwanese model has become a small overnight celebrity for helping her mom out selling fish at their stall in the local market. According to Apple Daily, 26-year-old Liu Pengpeng (劉芃芃) was noticed by a Facebook user selling fish at a wet market in Changhua.He snapped a few photos and then shot a quick video which he posted up on the social media site.

The next morning, in addition to a bunch of new customers, Taiwanese news channels also showed up en masse at Liu's fish stand.According to her mom, Liu comes back to help out quite a bit because she's concerned her mom may be working too hard. Good for Liu. Hopefully this isn't just a stunt as some agencies and street stalls have used models before to create buzz and increase sales and exposure.]]></description>

      <title>China, S. Korea and Japan fund coal plants overseas despite greener push at home</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EAST ASIA  China, Japan and South Korea are expanding coal plants in developing nations despite mounting evidence that the climate continues to get worse.A new report published by coal tracking company CoalSwarm shows that these three countries continue to fund coal plant construction in other nations such as Indonesia, Vietnam, South Africa and Bangladesh. China, Japan and South Korea are doing this despite transitioning to renewable energy sources at home, reports CleanTechnica.  Ted Nace, Executive Director of CoalSwarm, told CleanTechnica that they build coal plants overseas to "protect their equipment manufacturers.The report shows China has already funded at least 26 gigawatts of coal plants, which is equivalent to roughly 43 coal power plants.Japan has financed around 20 gigawatts which is around 32 plants. While South Korea has funded at least 8 gigawatts which is around 11 coal power plants.China is projected to increase the financing of coal plants to 43 gigawatts,  an increase of approximately 28 plants.South Korea is also set to increase funding to 14 gigawatts, which is an increase of around 23 plants.Meanwhile, Japan is actually projected to decrease funding by around 10 gigawatts.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists find subterranean ecosystem of deep life microbes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAMPA, FLORIDA  New research has revealed a rich subterranean ecosystem within the Earth almost twice the size of the world's oceans.The Guardian reports that Deep Carbon Observatory scientists made boreholes over 5 kilometers deep, and drilled 2.5 kilometers below the seabed to find an underground biosphere containing 'deep life' microbes that may have persisted for thousands or millions of years.These previously unknown lifeforms thrived despite extreme temperature and pressure. They reportedly fed on energy from rocks, and existed in a slow-motion, zombie-like state.The results suggest that 70% of the Earth's bacteria and archaea exist underground, amounting to between 15 and 23 million tonnes of carbon.Among them are barbed Altiarchaealis that live in sulphuric springs and Geogemma barossii, a single-celled organism found in hydrothermal vents on the seafloor, whose cells grow and replicate at 250 degrees Fahrenheit.Researchers have been trying to determine the boundary where life cannot exist, but the deeper they dig, the more life they find.Though there is a temperature maximum set at 251 degrees Fahrenheit, scientists think further exploration using more sophisticated instruments might break that record.]]></description>

      <title>Investigation: 'Nightmare' working
conditions in Chinese toy factories</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GUANGDONG, CHINA  A report by human rights watchdogs, China Labor Watch, ActionAid, CiR, and Solidar Suisse shows the harrowing reality of labor conditions in Chinese toy factories. The campaign groups sent undercover investigators to four major toy factories in Guangdong, China.The factories manufacture products for brands like Hasbro, Mattel and Disney as well as German manufacturers.The investigation uncovered a total of 23 severe rights violations.According to the report, workers at one of the factories live in unsanitary dorms sharing a small single room with eight to 10 people.Key findings reveal that factory workers put in 80 to 175 overtime hours per month. The Chinese labor department only allows for 36 overtime hours a month.In three of the four factories, workers were made to sign blank contracts without explanation. Workers did not receive copies of their own contracts.Workers also did not receive safety equipment as well as the legally required 24-hour safety training before starting work. This training is important as the workers handle toxic chemicals.Employees reported being fined or even dismissed it they took sick days. All four factories do not have independent unions to help regulate working conditions.The report comes out just in time for the holiday season. Simone Wasmann, from Solidar Suisse hopes parents will think twice before purchasing toys from Hasbro, Disney and Mattel saying "there's no Christmas magic going on here: those toys were made with cheap labour by women working illegally long hours for pennies."]]></description>

      <title>Company creates stickers that keep fruit fresh</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MALAYSIA  A Malaysian company has come up with the idea of using stickers to prolong the shelf life of fruits.Stixfresh founder Zhafri Zainudin told Mashable he created the product not to halt nature, but to "slow it down."The stickers are made of organic materials such as Sodium Chloride and beeswax, Mashable reports. They work to slow the ripening process as it removes the widely-used ripening agent ethylene from the fruit.It apparently also stops mold from growing on fruits and will keep them. According to Stixfresh's website, this will keep them "firm, sweet and juicy." The stickers are able to extend the shelf life of fruits upto two weeks.For now, these stickers are only effective on some fruits such as apples, pears, kiwis, mangos, oranges and a few others. The company plans to expand and create stickers for other fruits such as berries and even vegetables.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[FORTNITE  The ever changing world of Fortnite is about to get even more up close and personal with the introduction of swords into the battle royale game. The news however isn't coming out of left field. According to Forbes, Fortnite Season 7 debuted with a shot of tactical Santa leading a Snowman army with a sword in hand. Then Epic dropped a follow up on Twitter with the Ice King playing around with a similar sword along with the caption, "Coming soon...a weapon fit for a King."Currently, the only melee weapon in Fortnite is the pickaxe, which isn't the greatest. According to the Verge, no one really knows how the swords will be incorporated or when they'll be available, but it's sure to change the dynamics of the melee combat game. Fortnite already has a lot going on with Season 7. Epic released a revamped island with new features like planes and ziplines, and also introduced a new mode called creative.]]></description>

      <title>Hawaiian monk seals keep getting eels stuck in their noses</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HAWAII  An endangered Hawaiian monk seal was spotted chilling on a sandy white beach with a spotted eel stuck in its noseand researchers have no idea how it got there. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program posted the photo on Facebook last week. According to the Washington Post, the shot was taken this year in the northwestern Hawaiian islands, but scientists are baffled as to why.According to the NOAA, they've only seen this happen a few times since 2016. All the little fellows were caught and released after the eels were removed. Researchers have only come up with two guesses as to why this happens. Hawaiian monk seals look for food by jamming their mouth and nose into cracks of coral reefs, under rocks or into the sand. Maybe the eel had nowhere else to go. Another hypothesis is that the seal, which often throws up food, was vomiting when the eel came out the wrong holeyummy.While researchers continue scratching their heads, the endangered Hawaiian monk seals can rest easy, because the NOAA now has guidelines for yanking eels out safely.]]></description>

The dark chocolate seeped through the gates and poured out into the street, and then because of the cold weather, quickly solidified. Around 108 square feet of delicious chocolate had to be cleared by firefighters using shovels, hot water and blowtorches. Workers from the chocolate factory also pitched in and got their hands wonderfully dirty.    But not to fret, according to DreiMeister, there's still plenty of chocolate left over for Christmas.

      <title>Chronic bullying could affect
brain development in teenagers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON   A research from King's College London published in the journal Nature, studied the effects of chronic bullying among young adults between the ages of 14 and 19 years old.The study warns that bullying during adolescence can alter the brain's shape and in turn cause social and mental health issues.Researchers gave participants brain scans and questionnaires to understand the extent of the bullying they have suffered.Results revealed that the brains of the most bullied participants had certain regions of their brains that had shrunk The areas of the brain that had shrunk are called the putamen and caudate. They assist in behavioral processes such as emotional processing and attention span.Nineteen-year-olds from the study who showed shrinking of these areas also experienced higher levels of anxiety.This study is the first to connect bullying during adolescence to brain development.]]></description>

      <title>Google plans huge development for home city of Mountain View</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA  Google has announced plans for a massive development in its home city of Mountain View, California, which includes plans for office, retail, public and residential space. According to CNBC, the development is planned for the North Bayshore area of the city and includes 3.12 million square feet of offices, up to 400,000 square feet for retail stores, as many as 8,000 new homes and 35 acres of public space. Google will team up with a developer to build up to 6,600 of those new homes on its land, with 20 percent set aside for affordable housing. "We want to see the area transformed into what the City calls 'Complete Neighborhoods,' with a focus on increasing housing options and creating great public spaces that prioritize people over cars," said Michael Tymoff, Google's Mountain View development director, in a statement.City officials are set to discuss the plans early next year. According to CNBC, Google has spent at least $2.8 billion acquiring property in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose over the last two years.]]></description>

      <title>Google has an internal Made-in-China problem</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GOOGLE  Google has a bit of an internal problem, but the cause of it originates from the Chinese Communist Party. According to Eli Lake in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion, when Google employees first found out about a project to build a censored search engine for China called Dragonfly, thousands signed an open letter in protest. But apparently there are some Googlers who believe Dragonfly is a good thing. Around 500 or so have signed a letter stating their case on an internal company message board. Here's the kickerthe campaign was spearheaded by Chinese nationals working at Google.  The letter reeks of the CCP. It says Google should try to get back into China before writing off 1.4 billion people and a bunch of other Beijing babble.   Lake points out the letter brings up the core issue of how the Chinese government uses its tentacles to pressure and deploy its people to expand its power and influence. This isn't the only time the Panda has reared its ugly head. In 2008, the company cafeteria offered a "Free Tibet Goji-Chocolate Creme Pie." A Chinese national was actually offended, not only that, he or she then took the time to write an email whining to then Chief Exec Larry Page. The chef was immediately suspended. And only after a company wide email thread did the chef get reinstated. Suspended in America over a Free Tibet pie because a Chinese person was offended? Absurd. Should Google go ahead with Dragonfly? Of course not. Will it? What do you think?]]></description>

Prosecutors say a grenade, a rifle, and several knives were found during a search of his apartment.Hours later, Chekatt walked through the Strasbourg Christmas market armed with a gun. He open fired several times, and also used a knife during the attack. Witnesses say he shouted 'Allahu Akbar' as he did so.Four anti-terrorism Operation Sentinelle soldiers patrolling the area exchanged fire with the 29-year-old suspect and wounded him in the arm.He managed to get into a taxi, which took him to the Neudorf district near the Franco-German border, where his apartment was located.Chekatt came across police after getting out of the taxi, resulting in another exchange of gunfire. According to the New York Times, authorities eventually lost track of him.French authorities immediately blocked main roads out of the city, and mobilized more than 700 security forces to hunt for the gunman.According to the Paris prosecutor's office, three police officers recognized Chekatt on a Neudorf street around 9 p.m. Thursday.

      <title>China building nuclear test facility to rival America's Z machine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MIANYANG, CHINA  China is building a version of America's Z machine that will simulate thermonuclear explosions at a much larger scale.The South China Morning Post reports that according to a Beijing-based nuclear physicist, researchers at the nuclear weapons development base in Mianyang are building a Z machine designed to produce 60 million joules of energy.To do this, electrical pulses are fired at a target consisting of hundreds of tungsten wires. The flow of energy dissolves the tungsten into plasma and creates a strong magnetic field.Exploded particles are forced inward. They then collide with each other to produce intense radiation in the form of X-ray energy, creating conditions that reflect a nuclear explosion.The facility would allow researchers to see how weapons fare under extreme conditions. It could also help develop technology to harness clean energy in unlimited quantities.Associate professor Liu Bo from Sichuan University's Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology says the machine could be powerful enough to start fusion. This occurs when atomic nuclei merge, and results in the release of vast amounts of energy.]]></description>

      <title>Supernova radiation may have
wiped our Megalodon from Earth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[US  An exploding star may have wiped out the megalodon.New research sheds some light as to why and how the megalodon disappeared from the face of the Earth.The prehistoric shark is the largest fish ever recorded. According to the Natural History Museum of London, it could measure over 18 meters in length.The largest megalodon tooth found measures 17.8 centimeters in length, three times the size of a great white shark tooth.According to a research by the University of Zurich published in the journal PLOSONE, megalodons went extinct roughly 2.6 million years ago. A new paper by researchers from the University of Kansas, Federal University of Sao Carlos and Federal University of ABC proposes that ancient large marine animals may have become extinct due to exposure to cosmic radiation from nearby supernovae.   Prehistoric seabed deposits contain high concentration of ion 60-isotopes, which come from supernovae explosions.Although the isotope is harmless, it comes with other particles called muons. These particles can interact with cells of living organisms causing mutations and cancer.Researchers believe the megalodon's large size and tendency to inhabit shallow waters made it more susceptible to exposure to the supernova cosmic rays.Its extinction coincides with the detection of one or more supernovae occurring around 2.6 million years ago.Other research on the subject suggests the giant shark went extinct due to lack of prey and increased predatory competition.So if you want to see a Megalodon up close and personal try your luck at a museum, or watch Jason Statham battle one on the silver screen.

      <title>Is Google manipulating your search results?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[VALLEY FORGE, PENNSYLVANIA  DuckDuckGo, a search engine focused on privacy, claims that Google has been manipulating search results to show different users different results.DuckDuckGo conducted a study that found a majority of its 87 participants ended up with different search results for the same three keywords: "gun control", "immigration," and "vaccinations."Factors such as location, incognito mode, logging in and logging out were controlled for during the study, DuckDuckGo said.Participants were instructed to conduct the searches at the exact same time, using the exact same mode.The study found that Google search results came up with a number of different variations for the same topic.For instance, 76 people searched for the term "gun control" at the same time, logged out and using incognito mode across the U.S.As many as 62 differents sets of search results were shown to the participants.DuckDuckGo claims Google creates "filter bubbles" for its users based on factors such as search history and location.The Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based company also claims Google is personalizing search results for users even when they are in incognito mode and that Google uses personalization to shows users news articles that align with their worldview.In a statement to The Verge, Google called the study's methodology "flawed" and said that differences in search results are not based on personalization. Google said the difference search results could be the result of number of factors including time and location.]]></description>

      <title>What the hell is the Irish backstop?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM  An integral part of Brexit negotiations concerns the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  According to the BBC, last month, E.U. leaders approved a deal with the U.K. that includes an agreement on the Irish border, with both sides looking to avoid reintroducing border posts between the two areas. According to the Washington Post, the backstop is an insurance policy that would keep Britain in the E.U. customs union if no other agreement can be found to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  Because the U.K. and Ireland are currently both part of the E.U. single market and customs union, goods do not need to be inspected for customs and standards, so products and services can be traded on Ireland with few restrictions.However, after Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic could be in different customs and regulatory systems, which could mean hold ups for goods being checked at the border. The problem now is that both the U.K. and the E.U. have different opinions on what the backstop should contain. The E.U. had originally proposed that Northern Ireland stay in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the E.U. VAT system. Britain on the other hand, is against having a separate status for Northern Ireland because it feels it would damage the union as a whole. If the two sides cannot come to a deal on the backstop, it could mean a no-deal Brexit. This in turn could mean there would be some type of hard border with heavy checks in place between Northern Ireland and the Republic.]]></description>

      <title>Virgin Galactic first to
 fly airplane in space</title>
      <description><![CDATA[US  After 14 years of research, Spaceflight company Virgin Galactic, has flown the first successful spaceflight in history.This breakthrough takes us a step closer to a world where space tourism is a reality.According to a press release published by Virgin Galactic, the VSS Unity took off from the Mojave Desert in California. It soared at a speed of 3,500 kilometers per hour  almost 3 times the speed of sound and reached a height of over 80 kilometers.The SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship was carried by a larger aircraft called WhiteKnightTwo into high altitude. From there, it detached and flew into suborbital space.VSS Unity overlooked our blue planet from suborbital space for about a minute before beginning its descent.The rocket was flown by former NASA and U.S. Air Force test pilot Mark Stucky, and Fredrick Sturckow, former NASA astronaut who flew four Space Shuttle missions. Quite the resume for these two.They will be awarded wings from NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration following their historic flight. Well deserved.British mogul and owner of Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson, shed tears of joy as the spacecraft soared to space, saying 'This is a momentous day and I could not be more proud of our teams who together have opened a new chapter of space exploration.'Virgin Galactic is now a step ahead of competing space travel and research companies Space X and Blue Origin.Hey, Musk and Bezos, the ball is in your court now.]]></description>

      <title>Doctor's stethoscopes filled with nasty bacteria: Study</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA  A new study has found that doctors' stethoscopes maybe filled with infectious bacteria.The researchers tested 20 traditional reusable stethoscopes and 20 single-use disposable stethoscopes used in intensive care units. These were compared with 10 unused stethoscopes.High levels of Staphylococcus aureus and other bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were found to be present in the tested ICU stethoscopes.The study found that hydrogen peroxide wipes, alcohol swabs and bleach wipes reduced bacteria present but did not eliminate all of it completely.Dr. Ronald Collman, lead author of the study, said stethoscopes should regularly be cleaned using an EPA approved disinfectant. He added that future studies should focus on improving present cleaning methods.The research was published in the journal Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology.]]></description>

      <title>US approves the use of antibiotic
pesticides on citrus orchards</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FLORIDA   The pesticide will be applied to citrus fruits such as grapefruits, oranges and tangerines.  According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved the use of antibiotic pesticides on citrus crops.The antibiotics will be used to fight citrus canker and citrus greening disease in orchards. The plan is to use 388,000 pounds of oxytetracycline per year to treat 480,000 acres of citrus trees in Florida. According to the EPA, there is a 'high' probability that the use of the antibiotic pesticide on citrus orchards will lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.There is a 'medium risk' of it having a negative impact on human health. The drug is commonly used to treat pulmonary infections such as pneumonia.The World Health Organization states that antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health.A growing number of infectious diseases are becoming harder to treat as they become more resistant to antibiotic treatment.According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are currently more than two million people infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year which result in an estimated 23,000 deaths.]]></description>

      <title>What exactly does a no-deal Brexit mean?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM  The United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union at 11 p.m. GMT on March 29, 2019, and if a formal agreement cannot be reached, then there could be serious consequences for Britain. According to the Week, in a no-deal Brexit, all E.U. rules and regulations will instantly cease to apply in the U.K. In this event, there would be no remaining agreements between London and Brussels on how to handle customs, trade, travel or citizens rights. A no-deal Brexit would also mean the transition period for businesses and organizations to prepare for the changes from March 2019 to December 2020 would also be off the table. According to I News, in terms of trade, the U.K. would revert back to World Trade Organization rules. Britain would then be forced to pay the E.U.'s external tariffs. Prices in the U.K. on E.U. imported goods would also go up due to tariffs.  Citizens rights for the 1.3 million Britons in the E.U. and the 3.7 million Europeans in the U.K., in terms of the right to live and work, would be unclear. Relevant E.U. laws would be transferred over, while the U.K. would no longer have to adhere to rulings from the European Court of Justice.The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would also remain unresolved.]]></description>

      <title>Tourists can dive to the Titanic wreck for $100,000 in 2019</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ATLANTIC OCEAN  The world's most famous shipwreck is going to be accessible to tourists next year, provided they've got really deep pockets.According to Metro UK, deep-sea exploration company OceanGate is charging $105,129 for the chance to join a submarine mission to the wreck of the ill-fated ship.That's roughly the cost of a first class ticket on the Titanic in 1912, after inflation.For that much money, tourists will get to call themselves 'mission specialists' as they join exactly one dive on the 11-day mission. The dive to the wreck site entails taking a seven-hour trip in the Titan submersible.According to the description on the OceanGate website, they also get to "assist the expedition crew in one or more support roles aboard the surface vessel, and aboard Titan during a dive."Spots are limited  there are only six missions scheduled, and nine positions available per mission. The first four missions are also already full.]]></description>

      <title>Southwest passenger forced to leave pet fish at Denver airport</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DENVER  A University of Colorado student is missing her pet fish after she claims Southwest Airlines forced her to abandon it at the airport.According to KGTV, Lanice Powless was about to board her Denver to San Diego flight when a Southwest airline employee told her she couldn't take her pink male beta fish Cassie onboard.Powless had gotten her fishy friend during freshman year to curb her loneliness, and ended up falling in love with him.According to TSA guidelines, live fish are allowed as a carry-on, but Southwest policy only allows small dogs and cats in the cabin.Powless asked if she could leave her pet on the counter for a friend to pick up in 30 minutes, but the airline refused.She frantically looked around for someone else, and ended up handing him to a traveler on a more fish-friendly airline. But airport staff separated the two of them before she could get the stranger's name.Powless claims security kept following her afterward, and made her feel like a criminal. She got on her plane and made it home for winter break, but is still desperately searching for her little beta.She's aware everyone's laughing at her for her fishy dilemma, but says her pet fish is just as important as any dog or cat.Southwest confirmed the incident to USA Today, claiming they offered to rebook Powless so she can make plans for her fish, but that option was refused.]]></description>

      <title>Texas A&amp;M, UPenn merchandise made by force labor in China</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA    According to the Associated Press, the Chinese government is forcing some minorities who have been detained in internment camps to work in production factories.The camps are located in Xinjiang and house Uighurs, Kazakhs, Muslims and other minorities and, according to Chinese authorities, serve as free vocational training centers to stop militancy and fight poverty in the area.There are reportedly one million detainees in the camps where, according to testimonies gathered by Amnesty International, they are separated from their families, tortured and forced to give up their language, religion and political views.An investigation by ABC News Australia documented the shocking expansion of 28 detention camps in Xinjiang in from 2016 to 2018. The biggest camp was reported to cover over 500,000 square kilometers after just two years of construction.Once released from the internment camps, Chinese authorities send ex-detainees to work in food and manufacturing companies.Some of these factories are in the camps, while others are privately owned and state-subsidized.The Associated Press traced ongoing shipments from one factory that employs ex-detainees to an American sportswear company in North Carolina called Badger Sportswear.Photos posted in February on a Chinese social media platform show Ginny Gasswint, Badger Sportswear's marketing director, posing and smiling next to factory workers during a visit to the Hetian Taida Factory.In April this year, the 47-year-old sportswear company began shipping polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel in China. The address of the shipping records is the same on as the detention camps.The clothing company distributes sportswear to universities across the US. Among them: Texas A&M, the University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, the University of Northern Iowa, the University of Evansville and Bates College.Badger Sportswear says it will stop all shipments from China and move production while it conducts investigations.]]></description>

      <title>China and Russia are messing with Earth's ionosphere</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RUSSIA   China and Russia are testing technology that can manipulate areas of the atmosphere for potential military applications, reports the South China Morning Post.The newspaper, citing a Chinese scientist familiar with the research, reports China and Russia are conducting heating experiments in the Earth's ionosphere. The ionosphere is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that consists of ionized layers and free electrons. It can bounce radio waves across long distances.In one experiment, a Russian ionospheric heating facility called Sura injected electrons into the sky. They covered roughly 500 kilometers of the Russian city of Vasilsursk. The experiment made radio waves in the area peak at 260 megawatts.Controlling the ionosphere would allow for manipulation of communication signals around the world.A Chinese electromagnetic surveillance satellite called Zhangheng - 1 used special sensors to collect data from the experiments.China and Russia performed five experiments in June. During one of the experiments, the city reached an electric spike with 10 times more negatively charged subatomic particles than surrounding regions.]]></description>

      <title>Artificials islands bring nature back to Dutch lake</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARKERMEER LAKE, NETHERLANDS  An ambitious project led by a Dutch non-governmental organization has built five artificial islands from silt to restore nature to one of Europe's largest freshwater lakes.The Markermeer lake northeast of Amsterdam used to teem with an abundance of wildlife. It was created as part of a land reclamation plan that was scrapped over concerns it would dry out land around it and destroy an important site for migratory birds.However, silt from a dam used to create the Markermeer clouded the lake's waters, suffocating the algae that formed the base of its aquatic food chain.Dutch ngo Natuurmonumenten aimed to change that by silt to create five artificial islands. The five islands were built over a period of two-and-a-half years.Boskalis, the company that built the islands, dug a 1,200 meter trench on the main artificial island to allow silt to be drained by ocean currents to form marshy areas with fertile soil.According to a report by AFP and articles on Natuurmonumenten and Boskalis's websites, these areas are now home to birds such as sparrows, the greylag goose, the common tern and the night heron.An abundance of plankton in the water provides a guaranteed source of food for the birds.Experts have also counted 127 differents kinds of plants on the islands, most of them brought by windborne seeds.The main artificial island contains three wooden bird observatories, footbridges and unpaved roads and is open to the public. The other four islands are reserved only for wildlife and plants.]]></description>

      <title>Chicken-egg sized yellow diamond is largest found in North America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA  A yellow diamond discovered in a Canadian mine in October is said to be the largest in North America.Dominion Diamond Mines announced in a December 13 press release that it had unearthed a 552-carat yellow diamond at the Diavik Diamond Mines in Canada's Northwest Territories.According to Bloomberg, the gem is the size of a chicken egg. It's also three times the size of the previous record holder  the 187.7-carat Diavik Foxfire which was recovered at the same mine in 2015.Though the Diavik mine produces high-quality diamonds, the largest ones are normally found in mines in southern Africa. Bloomberg calculations rank the yellow diamond as seventh among the 21st century's biggest diamonds.Dominion says the diamond is gem-quality, or suitable for jewelry, though its worth is undetermined. It will not be sold in its rough form, as the company is expected to select a partner to cut and polish the stone.The Foxfire yielded two brilliant-cut pear shape gems that were auctioned off. They ended up being purchased for a cool $1.3 million.]]></description>

      <title>The Ocean Cleanup system isn't capturing plastic&#x2014;yet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH  A system designed to reduce the amount of plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean has not been collecting plastic. According to Forbes, the Ocean Cleanup System 001 created by The Ocean Cleanup left San Francisco in September with an overall goal of cleaning up half of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years and a 90 percent reduction by 2040. System 001 is a 2,000 feet long floater, with a 10-foot deep skirt connected below. The floater is designed to stop plastics from flowing over the system, while the skirt traps particles from escaping underneath. It's made from HDPE plastic and is flexible enough to bend with the waves, but rigid enough to form a U-shaped barrier to trap floating plastics pollution, according to Fast Company. The design takes advantage of natural oceanic forces to retrieve and concentrate the plastic.According to project leaders, aside from 2 metric tons of discarded fishing nets, no significant amount of plastic has yet been removed.The problem appears to be the system is moving too slow. Plastic enters the system, but is only concentrated for a few days, which is not long enough for it to be harvested. The organization said another problem is the system creates waves, preventing some plastic from entering the device. According to the organizers, increasing the span of System 001 should increase the surface that will effectively catch wind and waves, adding force, and increasing the floater's speed. They plan to make the system 25 percent bigger by opening the floater around 197 to 230 feet.According to Forbes, the team will continue to work to find a solution and hope to launch a System 002 in early 2020.]]></description>

      <title>Fortnite is facing lawsuits
over emote dances</title>
      <description><![CDATA[US   Looks like Epic Games needs to lawyer up.Fortnite, the biggest video game in the world, is getting a lot of attention from Hollywood lately, only it's not the good kind.Epic's free-to-play battle royale game recently hit over 200 million users, five times the number of players it had last year.Fortnite makes bank through microtransactions, the most popular ones being dance 'emotes' that make a player's characters unique.Fortnite dances are popular for taking inspiration from real life sources like the dab, the hype dance, salt bae and the infamous 'Carlton Dance' from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.Unfortunately for Fortnite, the people behind the dances are not happy being just an 'inspiration.'The floodgates opened when rapper 2 Milly filed a lawsuit against Fortnite claiming that Epic Games had 'unfairly profited from exploiting the rapper's protected creative expression and likeness.'Soon after, actor Alfonso Ribeiro, also known as the man Behind the Carlton dance form the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, also filed a lawsuit claiming he is currently in the process of copyrighting the dance.The latest person to sue Epic Games is Rusell Horning, better known as the 'Backpack Kid' from Katy Perry's 2017 SNL performance, and the teen behind the viral 'Floss' dance. He is accusing both Fortnite and 2K Sports of theft.According to TechCrunch, Gabby David, the online creator and dancer behind another dance 'emote' called 'Electro Shuffle, claims she got a settlement for her choreography feature in the game.However, copyrighting these dances might be complicated.According to the U.S. Copyright Office, you 'cannot register short dance routines consisting of only a few movements or steps with minor linear or spatial variations, even if a routine is novel or distinctive.'Actor Donald Faison from Scrubs, whose dance is also featured in the game, hasn't sued but has expressed discontent on his Twitter account and at public events, telling the crowd at a Scrubs reunion that if they wanted to see his famous dance 'they could go play Fortnite.']]></description>

      <title>Postmates introduces autonomous delivery robots</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  Postmates has rolled out its new autonomous delivery robot named "Serve." According to Adweek, the food and grocery delivery company unveiled the Wall-E-esque robot last Thursday with plans to have it navigate sidewalks and streets to deliver food, packages and other small things in urban settings. The robot looks like a brightly colored cooler on wheels. From the side, it looks like a shopping cart with a lid. It comes equipped with an array of cameras for navigation. For now, Serve can carry about 50 pounds and travel 30 miles on a single charge. Postmates says the delivery rover will be used for short distance deliveries, like a couple of blocks away. To get your order you just need to punch in a code on the touchscreen or use your phone to unlock the latch on top of Serve.The rover uses a combination of cameras and LIDAR technology along with a processor from Nvidia to sense its surroundings.

      <title>Saturn is losing its rings at "worst-case-scenario" rate</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GREENBELT, MARYLAND  New NASA research confirms that Saturn is losing its rings at a rate which researchers describe as a "worst-case-scenario." Phys.org reports that using observations made by Voyager 1 and 2 decades ago, scientists say the rings are being pulled into Saturn by gravity as a dusty rain of ice particles under the influence of the planet's magnetic field. According to James O'Donoghue of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, this 'ring rain' drains enough water every 30 minutes to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. According to scientists' estimates, the rings could be completely gone in 100 million years. Saturn's rings are mainly composed of chunks of water ice ranging in size from microscopic dust to boulders several yards in width.  Ring particles have several forces acting upon them. Saturn's gravity want to draw the particles towards the planet, while their orbital velocity wants to shoot them out towards space.  The tiny particles can also get electrically charged from the Sun or from plasma clouds.These charged particles can also feel the pull of Saturn's magnetic field, which curves inward toward the planet at Saturn's rings.]]></description>

      <title>Trump orders full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SYRIA  President Trump has ordered full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, after claiming on Wednesday the Islamic State group had been "defeated.""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency," the president said in a Twitter post Wednesday morning. According to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement, "we have started returning United States troops home as we transition to the next phase of this campaign." According to Reuters, the decision for a total pull out coincides with the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops finishing up a campaign to retake territory held by Islamic State militants. One U.S. official told Reuters the administration is looking to withdraw troops within 60 to 100 days and the U.S. State Department was evacuating all personnel in Syria within 24 hours. According the BBC, U.S. troops have largely been stationed in the Kurdish region in northern Syria. A partnership with an alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, is said to have played a major role in the elimination of IS forces throughout the territory.Many of the remaining U.S. soldiers in Syria are special operations forces working closely with the SDF.]]></description>

      <title>U.S. Navy unsafely intercepted 18 times by China since 2016</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON / BEIJING  U.S. military statistics indicate that American naval forces have had more than a dozen unsafe encounters with Chinese forces over the last two years.Commander Nate Christensen, spokesman of the U.S. Pacific fleet, told CNN there have been 18 unsafe or unprofessional interactions with China and one with Russia since 2016.Most incidents reportedly happened during 2017. At least three that took place in February, May, and July involved Chinese fighter jets unsafely intercepting Navy surveillance planes.The U.S. frequently conducts freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea to challenge China's maritime claims in the area. This has resulted in several incidents throughout the years.The most recent encounter occurred on September 30 while the USS Decatur was sailing near Gavin Reef in the South China Sea's Spratly Islands.PRC destroyer Luyang reportedly came within 135 feet of the American vessel's bow, forcing it to maneuver to avoid a collision.The U.S. Air Force has had at least one encounter with China during the same period. In May 2017, Chinese SU-30 fighter jets came within 150 feet of a radiation detection plane over the East China Sea. One SU-30 was reportedly flying upside down directly above the American plane.Incidents are typically addressed through diplomatic and military channels, but the frequency of such encounters raises the possibility of a collision or clash that could spark major conflict between Washington and Beijing.Sino-U.S. tensions have been high in recent months, with the two countries embroiled in a bitter trade dispute. The Trump administration also previously sanctioned China for buying Russian fighter jets and missiles.]]></description>

      <title>Polar vortex could bring bitter winter to U.S. east coast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON   Climate scientists are warning that a polar vortex could sweep across the U.S. east coast and unleash one of the harshest winters in years.The polar vortex is an area of low pressure, cold air surrounding the north and south poles. The 'vortex' or counterclockwise flow of air keeps frigid air closer to the poles.But during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the vortex can often become less stable and expand. As a result, cold Arctic air is sent southward with the jet stream, causing severe winter weather.Vortex disruption has been associated with a phenomenon known as a sudden stratospheric warming event. During such an event, the prevailing winds decrease or change direction, and the layer warms.When this occurs, the vortex is displaced and sometimes splits apart.According to the Washington Post, American modeling systems project the disruption to occur this month. The European system, however, delays it until early January.While it's difficult to predict which region will be struck first, University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado claims Eurasia will be hit first, based on model forecasts. This means the Lower 48 states are likely weeks away from feeling any effect.That's plenty of time to stock up on hot chocolate, mulled wine, and other winter essentials.]]></description>

Luckily, no one was injured.A breathalyzer showed Lin hadn't been drinking  he was just really exhausted from working all night.Still, Lin is looking at an eye-popping NT$10 million in repair costs for the four sportscars. That's over three hundred grand in USD  a huge deal for a barbecue restaurant employee.It would have taken him more than two decades to pay off that amount on his salary alone. But many have sympathized with Lin and are coming forward with donations.Strangers have so far chipped in over US$24,000 to help pay for damages.Lin has also apologized to the Ferrari owners for the accident. Even though it wasn't intentional, he acknowledges that he committed a wrong and should pay the cost.]]></description>

      <title>Lucky diner finds pearl worth thousands in oyster lunch</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK CITY  A Jersey man's shellfish meal pretty much paid for itself, and more, after one of his oysters turned out to be a real gem.The New York Post reports that when Rick Antosh met a buddy for lunch at New York's Grand Central Oyster Bar on December 5, he ordered his usual oyster pan roast.All of a sudden, he felt something rolling around his mouth, and became momentarily terrified that he'd lost a tooth or filling.It turned out to be something way more valuable  the 66-year-old had been noshing on a pea-sized pearl, which he ended up pocketing.At the time, he didn't think it was all that unusual, and so didn't inform the restaurant. The place had been open since 1913, so customers finding a precious gem in their oyster probably wasn't that rare. Right?He later got curious and called the oyster bar, and was gobsmacked to be told it was only the second time something like this has happened in the last 28 years.Even more pleasantly surprising is the fact that the pearl is likely worth around 2 to 4 thousand bucks, according to one pearl dealer the Post consulted.Antosh still doesn't know what he's gonna do with his find, but damn  that $14 lunch was one heck of an investment.]]></description>

      <title>French inventors create a machine that converts plastic to fuel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PUGET-THENIERS, FRANCE  French actor Samuel Le Bihan and a self-taught inventor Christofer Costes have created a low-technology machine called Chrysalis that converts plastic waste to fuel in an effort to fight pollution and climate change.According to Reuters, the machine feeds on plastic pellets which are poured into its reactor where they are broken down at 450 degrees centigrade.Once broken down these turn into diesel and gasoline as well as a type of carbon residue that can be used in crayons.According to its creators, the Chrysalis can convert a kilo of plastic into a liter of fuel which is separated into diesel and petrol.Christofer Costes believes the machine's simple design will make it easy to operate and repair 'even in the depths of the African bush'.According to data from the UN, eight million tonnes of plastic waste enter the ocean each year.]]></description>

      <title>Soy sauce 'detox' leaves woman
unable to move, swallow or speak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO, ILLINOIS  A 'detox' treatment gone horribly wrong.A 39-year-old woman in Chicago drank one liter of soy sauce in two hours, leaving her brain dead."According to a study on her case featured on the medical YouTube channel Chubbyemu, in 2012 the woman had recently been discharged from a psychiatric facility after being treated for paranoid schizophrenia.She was already physically unwell. The woman had lost 11 kilograms after following an extreme diet that consisted of solely eating canned tuna and white bread.She believed the government was poisoning her and so turned to the interwebs for help.This is where she found the infamous soy sauce detox routine that she thought would cleanse her colon and body of toxins.Unsurprisingly, the woman, referred to in the case study as 'CG,' began to feel dizzy and fall in and out of consciousness after drinking a liter of soy sauce.She was taken to the emergency room in Chicago's Illinois Medical District area where she was treated for acute hypernatremia, or high levels of sodium in her blood.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, high sodium consumption can raise blood pressure and even cause heart disease and stroke.According to a study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, even 25 grams of sodium can constitute a lethal dose for adults. After drinking one liter of soy sauce, the woman had unknowingly ingested 200 grams of salt.The salt traveled to her brain through her blood and began to cause brain shrinkage as it absorbed water from the brain's tissue.Doctors began treating her with glucose-laden water to stabilize sodium levels in her body."Unfortunately, days after the treatment CG exhibited dysarthria, dysphagia and quadriplegia, meaning she was unable to move, swallow or speak.MRI scans revealed CG had central pontine myelinolysis, a form of nerve cell damage that left her unable to send nerve signals to the rest of her body.According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, this disorder is a result of too rapid medical correction of sodium deficiency.Earlier this year another health fad called Jilly Juice, a blend consisting of saltwater and fermented kale or cabbage, went viral with its creator, Jillian Epperly, claiming it could 'cure' everything from down syndrome to homosexuality.According to BuzzFeed News, the detox-drink is sold as a purgative that causes nausea, headaches, dizziness and severe diarrhea that Jillian lovingly refers to as 'waterfalls.'Let's just stick to veggies and fruits okay people?]]></description>

      <title>Chinese town bans Santa Claus and Christmas</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LANGFANG, CHINA  A town in northern China is really getting into the Christmas spirit this year by banning it. Officials from Langfang in the Hebei province have ordered that all festive decorations be torn down, while shops have been banned from selling Christmas junk to "maintain stability," according to the SCMP. The statement from the fun-loving city management office also asked the public to snitch on anyone "spreading religion" in parks and squares. It also said that anyone caught selling Christmas trees, wreaths, stockings or Santa Claus figurines would be punished. Stores are also prohibited from holding Christmas performances or promotional sales. But honestly, what's the point of banning something that almost no one in Asiaoutside of some expatscelebrates? Guess the only Ho Ho Ho's you'll be hearing are people with that last name.]]></description>

      <title>Aquarium gets backlash over  'thicc otter' tweet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA  An aquarium's attempt to be witty on the web backfired spectacularly after their attempt at internet-speak ended up being problematic.USA Today reports that when the Monterey Bay Aquarium tweeted a photo of Abby the sea otter on December 19, it came with a caption that started with: 'Abby is a thicc girl.'The tweet then went on to comment on the sea otter's size by referencing a whole bunch of memes, the point of which was apparently to show just how big the animal can be out of the water.Some people found the tweet amusing enough. But others didn't think it was cute, especially finding the use of the word 'thicc' offensive.For those living under a rock, 'thicc' is slang for a full-figured body, specifically one with a curvy waist and big butt. The term supposedly dates back to black culture in the 90s, when it was used in reference to women.One user referred to it as 'digital blackface' while others called out the 'shamefully appropriative' use of African American Vernacular English, or AAVE.A University of Washington professor also chimed in to say: "I'm certain that @MontereyAq didn't realize that they were basically comparing Black women to animals by using AAVE developed to talk about Black women's bodies to describe an animal."Monterey Bay Aquarium has since apologized for their problematic post in a series of tweets. And since we're in peak 2018 where you can't please anyone, some folks were in turn offended that an apology was necessary.Not sure what any of you feel, but we here at TomoNews think people should just chill and focus on the damn otter.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[BARCELONA, SPAIN  An Italian bioengineer at a Spanish startup claims to have invented the world's first vegan steak made using 3D printing technology.Giuseppe Scionti from Spanish startup Novameat created a mixture that includes rice, peas and seaweed to create a 3D-printed patty that mimics the fleshy texture of texture of beef.Scionti said the the machine is able to create the meat-like texture without using high temperatures and keep the nutritional content of the steak.The ingredients are turned into a paste and mixed with a paella colourant and inserted into syringes.The syringes are inserted into a 3D printer and then printed into a steak-like product. After being printed, the steak can go on to be cooked.In addition to the steak, the company has also developed a vegan chicken breast made from ingredients including lipids, fibers, minerals and vitamins that mimics the texture animal meat.Scionti, who founded Nova Meat, told architecture and design magazine Dezeen that it takes around 30 minutes to print a 100 gram of steak.In addition to creating an ethical meat alternative, Scionti hopes the vegan steaks will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock to make our planet more sustainable.]]></description>

The company also said it cannot read users' messages.Sony, Microsoft, and Amazon acquired users' email information through their friends, reports The New York Times.The report also says Facebook allowed Apple to hide notifications from Facebook users that showed its devices were seeking user data.Apple told the Times it was unaware that Facebook had given its devices access to such information.The report says most of Facebook's deals with these businesses were active in 2017 and some remain active.In a statement, Facebook said companies are not granted access to private information without their users' permission. The social network explained these companies are considered as an extension of Facebook and have to abide by people's privacy settings.All of this appears to contradict what Zuck told lawmakers earlier this year. At a U.S. House of Representatives hearing in April Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that users "have complete control" of their information on the site.]]></description>

      <title>Ford presents sound-proof 
dog kennel prototype</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TONBRIDGE, UNITED KINGDOM  Fireworks and vacuums will no longer torment our furry friends.Ford has designed a prototype for a noise-canceling dog kennel employing the same noise-control technology installed in some Ford vehicles. The design is part of an innovation series called Interventions, which explores the use of automotive technologies to solve everyday problems. According to a press release published in the company's blog, the kennel is isolated with high-density cork, noise cancellation panels, anti-vibration block risers, and soundproof ventilation.Special microphones installed within the kennel detect loud noises. A built-in audio system then generates opposing frequencies, significantly reducing noise within the kennel.According to the American Kennel Club, dogs have a maximum hearing sensitivity of 8,000 hertz. Human's maximum hearing sensitivity of 2,000 hertz making doggos more sensitive to loud noises.]]></description>

      <title>Holiday chaos as rogue drones shut down Gatwick Airport</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GATWICK, UNITED KINGDOM  Tens of thousands of passengers have had their travel plans disrupted after one of London's busiest airports shut down due to drone activity on the runway.According to the BBC, the runway at Gatwick Airport was closed after two drones were seen flying over a perimeter fence around 9 p.m. on Wednesday.It reopened around 3 a.m. Thursday, before closing again after 45 minutes amid further sightings. Sussex police say there have been 50 reported sightings in 24 hours.The New York Times reports that at least 800 flights were canceled, affecting over 100,000 passengers. Incoming flights were diverted to other airports, with some landing as far as Paris and Amsterdam.Twenty police units searched the airfield perimeter on Thursday, but could not locate the drones' operators.Sussex police had earlier ruled out shooting down the drones, citing concerns over stray bullets. But they are now considering it as a tactical option.According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, the British army has also been called in to assist, and are deploying specialist equipment.According to USA Today, authorities described the drones as "industrial specification." This indicates they are larger than hobby aircraft, and "could be more dangerous if they crash into a plane's windshield or get absorbed by its engines."Officials have called the repeated drone incursions a "deliberate act", but say there's no indication to suggest that it is terror-related.With the drone still at large, officials say Gatwick Airport could remain closed for all of Friday.]]></description>

      <title>First no-kill eggs now
available in Germany</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY  Scientists and researchers in Berlin have developed breakthrough technology that helps determine the gender of a chick before it hatches.The new technology has been developed by a German research group called 'Seleggt. It is the result of a cooperation between German grocery retail group REWE and the University of Leipzig.The main goal of the group is to put an end to chick culling. Chick culling is the act of killing male chicks within the poultry industry due to their poor meat quality and growth.According to a report by the group, the new technique, dubbed 'The Seleggt Process', uses a non-invasive procedure to extract allantois fluid from fertilized eggs.The fluid is then collected into a container that changes color depending on whether the embryo is male or female.Male eggs are then separated from female eggs and turned into feed and female eggs go on to hatch and grow into laying hens.Jan Kunath, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of REWE Group explained the no-kill eggs would help put an end to male chick culling. In a statement he said he "strongly believes that the extra price of a few cents per egg carton is well invested."According to Agriculture website WATTAgNet, about four to six billion male chicks are culled immediately after hatching in the U.S.According to data from Seleggt, 45 million male day-old chicks of the egg-laying breeds are killed each year in Germany.]]></description>

      <title>Man mistaken for Bigfoot gets bombarded with gunfire</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HELENA, MONTANA  A man who was out target shooting on Montana public land unwittingly became a target himself, after he got mistaken for a big, hairy, mythical beast.According to the Helena Independent Record, the 27-year-old told cops that he had been setting up targets when bullets started flying at him.He saw one bullet hit 3 feet to his left and another zoom past on his right, before he ran for cover as more shots blasted at him.Once the gunfire died down, he confronted the shooter, who merely claimed, 'I thought you were Bigfoot' and advised him to wear orange next time. Wow, not even a sorry for almost killing a dude.The hunter then explained that while he doesn't do target practice, he will shoot at anything that looks like Bigfoot. Well, that's not problematic or anything.While the victim doesn't want to press charges, deputies are concerned about the Bigfoot hunter's trigger-happy tendencies, and are now looking for him.So far, they know the suspect drives a black F-150. And after the story was published in the local paper, a woman with a similar experience came forward to give a description of the man, according to the Idaho Statesman. That's a start, at least.According to the cops, the hunter may not be a danger to the public, but if reports are true, he could be looking at attempted negligent homicide charges.]]></description>

      <title>'Nosey's Law' bans animals from New Jersey circus acts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TRENTON, NEW JERSEY   New Jersey's governor has signed ''Nosey's Law', a bill  prohibiting the use of wild and exotic animals in traveling animal acts.According to a statement released by the State of New Jersey, the law was a success in both houses of the legislature passing 71-3 in the Assembly, and 36-0 in the Senate.The bill had previously passed but was pocket-vetoed by ex-Governor Chris Christie, forcing the new administration under Phil Murphy to re-introduce and approve it.The law bans wild and exotic animals from being exhibited in carnivals, circuses, fairs, exhibitions, parades, races, rides or any animal show in which wild animals are forced to perform for the entertainment of a live audience.Governor Murphy celebrated the passing of the bill. In a statement, he said, "I am proud to sign 'Nosey's Law' and ensure that New Jersey will not allow wild and exotic animals to be exploited and cruelly treated within our state."The law is named after Nosey, a 36-year-old arthritic African elephant that suffered abuse and exploitation while working in a traveling circus.According to PETA, Nosey suffered extreme abuse under her handlers. When she was rescued, Nosey was found with infections in her urinary tract and skin, as well as signs of dehydration and malnutrition. Nosey is now safely enjoying life and taking naps under the sun at an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee.According to the Animal Legal Defense Fund, New York and Illinois banned the use of elephants in entertainment acts in 2017. However, these laws do not cover wild and exotic animals.According to PETA, there are 19 countries worldwide that have banned the use of wild animals in circuses. These nations include Austria, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, Greece, Israel, Mexico, The Netherlands, and Singapore.]]></description>

      <title>Japan announces plans to 
resume commercial whaling</title>
      <description><![CDATA[JAPAN  The Japanese government reportedly has plans to resume commercial whaling for the first time in 30 years.According to Kyodo News, Japan plans to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission in 2019 amid plans to resume commercial whaling.Japan has to present its official withdrawal to the commission by the end of the year. If accepted, the decision would be effective the following June.The decision comes after the IWC rejected Japan's proposal to resume commercial whaling at an annual meeting in Brazil in September. Although Japan has not technically practiced commercial whaling for 30 years, it has been hunting whales in the Antarctic Ocean for "scientific research" under the exception of an IWC rule.According to the BBC, Japanese whalers have caught between about 200 and 1,200 whales each year. They claim they are investigating stock levels to see whether the whales are endangered or not.If Japan leaves the IWC, the country can no longer continue to conduct "scientific" whaling expeditions in the Antarctic. However, the Japanese government plans to limit its whaling to its exclusive economic zone, which covers an area of over four million square kilometers, according to geography website World Atlas.Iceland and Norway are the only other countries in the world that authorize whaling. Both are members of the IWC.IWC members Denmark, Russia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the US allow indigenous or aboriginal subsistence whaling for a few native populations who hunt whales as part of their culture.]]></description>

      <title>Cop drives couple to wedding after they get in fender bender</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK  A Long Island couple on their way to get married over the weekend got into a little fender bender which almost caused them to miss the wedding.  Enter the good old boys in blue. According to NBC 4 News, Joseph DeMichele and Felice Terwilliger were en route to the town hall in Lake Grove when they crashed into a car in front of them that was doing a U-turn. Luckily no one was hurt when the accident occurred at 1:15 p.m. The only problem was the wedding was set for 1:30 p.m and now their Jeep Grand Cherokee was out of commission. When Suffolk County Police Sergeant Thomas Kennedy showed up on the scene and found out about the couples' dilemma, he called for another squad car.  That's when Officer Cody Matthews showed up and drove the couple, including their two kids ages 5 and 10, to their ceremony. So with the sirens blaring, the patrol car zipped the couple with their kids right up to the town hall doorsteps.When they got to town hall, they found out that they were short one witness, so they asked Officer Matthews if he could lend a helping hand.  Matthews ended up being DeMichele's best man and his witness. Talk about some wedding crashers.]]></description>

      <title>Cruise ship saves men who were adrift at sea for 20 long days</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WATERWORLD  Two Costa Rican fishermen who spent nearly three weeks adrift at sea were rescued by a cruise ship last week.According to CNN, the two mariners originally set off from Costa Rica, but as they were sleeping one night, their boat drifted away from their fishing gear because of bad weather. They ran out of fuel trying to get back. Unfortunately, they only had enough food and water for seven days.  Luckily for the two fishermen, Royal Caribbean's Empress of the Seas cruise ship had been rerouted because of inclement weather. Due to "pure luck" the cruise ship spotted a signal light at 7 p.m. last Friday night. The ship contacted rescue centers in Grand Cayman and Jamaica, but they were unable to help. Around 10 p.m, the ship lowered a smaller boat known as a tender to rescue the two fishermen. They were given water and medical attention as soon as they were on board the ship.The two were dropped off at Ocho Rios in Jamaica for further medical attention.

      <title>U.S. Military tracks Santa despite government shutdown</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DENVER  The U.S. government is keeping a close eye on Father Christmas.The North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, will continue to monitor Santa this year despite the U.S. government being partially shutdown.Children can track Santa's journey on NORAD's website starting from Christmas Eve every year.This tradition began in 1955 when a department store accidently printed the phone number to the Continental Air Defense Command, according to the Washington Post. U.S. Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup picked up calls from children and pretended to be Santa for the holidays.Since then, NORAD has been tracking Santa's sleigh and reindeers and letting children know where Santa currently is.A spokeswoman for NORAD told Reuters that Santa is tracked using infrared signals that are transmitted from Rudolph's nose.]]></description>

      <title>Man abandons dog on the side of the road in England</title>
      <description><![CDATA[STOKE-ON-TRENT, ENGLAND   Surveillance video released by a British animal rescue charity show the moment a man dumps his pet bull terrier on a street in England.According to The Huffington Post, the incident occurred around 5pm on December 17 in the city of Stoke-On-Trent. In the footage we see the man drop a dog bed on the side of the road and run back into his car. The doggo, clearly confused, chases after his owner. The car stays parked on the side of the road while the poor doggo anxiously circles around it jumping up and down trying to catch a glimpse of his owners. The man then tries to drive off but the dog runs after it and again jumps up at the windows trying to grab its owners' attention. Rescuers found the poor doggo about an hour later and took him to the vet. They also gave him a new name, Snoop.RSPCA inspector, Natalia Perehovsky, told Sky News, "To see the poor dog in such obvious distress, jumping up at the car as it drives away, is just heartbreaking. I can't understand how someone could do this."]]></description>

      <title>Happy Christmas from Mars!</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARS  The European Space Agency snapped an image of Mars' Korolev crater which is filled with 530 cubic miles of water ice.The images were taken by the Mars Express probe, reports The Guardian. That spacecraft was sent into orbit 15 years ago on Christmas Day in 2003.The crater is 50 miles wide and is close to the Martian north pole. A topographic image of the crater was taken as well, showing the terrain of the region.The crater is icy all-year round because of a phenomenon known as "cold trap."This is when the deeper parts of the crater trap the ice while a layer of cold air is created right above it. This layer shields the ice and prevents it from disappearing.]]></description>

      <title>Google has to hit the brakes on censored Dragonfly project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA  Google's lame idea to create a censored search engine for the Chinese authoritarian regime might have hit a bit of a snag after the company's privacy team raised internal complaints about being kept in the dark.According to the Intercept, the spat began in mid-August when it was revealed that Google employees working on Dragonfly had been using a Beijing-based website to develop blacklists approved by the Chinese dictatorship. Google bought Beijing-based website 265.com in 2008 and had been using it to study Chinese users' search habits. Data pulled from 265.com was integral in the design of Dragonfly. Members of Google privacy team, however, were not told about the use of 265.com, which was a serious breach of company protocol. Normally, studying people's search habits is subject to tight constraints and should be reviewed by the company's privacy department, who are tasked with protecting user rights. However, the privacy team only found out about the 265.com data usage from an Intercept report. Following several meetings, Dragonfly engineers were told to stop using 265.com data, which has had severe consequences for the censored search engine. For now it looks like Google will have to hit the brakes before it can start doing Beijing's bidding. That's too bad for Google, because who wouldn't want to help the CCP throw innocent Chinese people in jail for using the damn internetsorry, INTRANET!?]]></description>

      <title>Car goes Dukes of Hazzard into roof of tunnel in Slovakia</title>
      <description><![CDATA[POPRAD, SLOVAKIA  Amazing CCTV footage captured the moment a car did its best Dukes of Hazzard impression after it launched into the air into the roof of a tunnel in Slovakia. According to the Express, the incident took place at the Börik tunnel, close to Poprad in the north-eastern part of the country, shortly before 5 a.m. last Thursday. Looks like the 44-year-old driver of the BMW dozed off when his car drove right into a roadside barrier, sending it airborne.That's when the front of the car was introduced to the top of the tunnel. Miraculously, besides some bumps and bruises, the driver made it through without sustaining any injuries.  After a breathalyzer, the po po said the driver was not intoxicated at all and appears to have just fallen asleep behind the wheel.  Unfortunately for the driver, his ride was completely totalled. It's unclear whether or not he is expected to face any charges.]]></description>

      <title>Helicopter crash kills Mexican governor and senator husband</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PUEBLA, MEXICO  The first female governor of Mexico's second largest city, and her senator husband lost their lives in a tragic Christmas Eve helicopter crash.According to the BBC, the Mexico city bound helicopter carrying Puebla governor Martha Erika Alonso and Senator Rafael Moreno Valle took off from a Puebla city helipad on Monday afternoon.The Augusta 109 helicopter reportedly lost contact with air traffic control and fell 10 minutes after takeoff. It crashed around 2:50 p.m. local time in a cornfield in the municipality of Santa Maria Coronango.Alonso and Moreno Valle died in the crash along with the two pilots and another unidentified passenger.Federal and state officials say they have opened investigations into the cause of the accident, but some are calling for an independent probe as the case is potentially sensitive.Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's leftist Morena party had challenged the validity of Alonso's election in July. There were allegations that Moreno Valle, who governed Puebla from 2011 to 2017, manipulated the election to pass power to his wife.Alonso was sworn in just ten days ago after an electoral tribune validated the results.]]></description>

by volcano eruption</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SUNDA STRAIT, INDONESIA  The tsunami killed at least 373 people and severely damaged infrastructure.A tsunami struck coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java, Indonesia on Saturday.The tsunami was caused by an eruption from Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island that sits in the Pacific "Ring of Fire" in the Sunda Strait.According to Reuters, the eruption caused a 64-hectare portion of the volcano to collapse into the ocean triggering an underwater landslide that would set off the tsunami.No warning system was triggered at the time of the tsunami. Indonesian officials stated that their tsunami buoy network has not been operational since 2012.According to The Guardian, if a buoy network had been installed around Anak Krakatao, it would have given surrounding towns a maximum of a one-to-two minute warning ahead of pending waves."The tsunami demolished over 700 buildings and left hundreds dead or missing just 24 hours after the volcanic landslide.Anak Krakatao is one of 76 active volcanoes in Indonesia.]]></description>

      <title>Aleph Farms created the first lab-grown steak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ISRAEL  Israeli startup Aleph Farms has reached an important milestone in cellular meat production by creating the world's first lab-grown steak.According to the company, the steak has a similar texture to conventional meat, and has the same smell, however the taste and thickness still need to be refined. According to Business Insider, the prototype took 2-3 weeks to grow, with a small strip costing $50. According to Digital Trends, to grow the meat, Aleph Farms first isolates four types of animal cells from a living cow. These cells are then nourished in a growth medium to develop into a complex matrix that replicates muscle tissue.   Speaking to Digital Trends, co-founder and CEO Didier Toubia said, "this improved meat production method saves significant amounts of water and land, avoids animal welfare issues and antibiotics use." According to Toubia, they still need at least two more years of development before the meat is commercially available.]]></description>

      <title>US weapons and advisors used in Saudi Arabia-Yemeni conflict</title>
      <description><![CDATA[YEMEN  Germany, Finland, and Denmark have stopped arms sales to Saudi Arabia due to the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The US, however, has not.According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Saudi Arabia is America's number one weapons buyer. The country accounts for 18 percent of total U.S. arms sales, which is equivalent to roughly $9 billion.According to CNN, the US signed a $29.4 billion deal in 2011 for 84 new F-15SA fighter jets, and the modernization of 70 current F-15s, including munitions, spare parts, training, maintenance, and logistics.In 2017, the U.S. military sold the Kingdom a $750 million program focused on how to carry out airstrikes. They also authorized the sale of over $510 million in precision-guided munitions, according to The New York Times.In the same year, the U.S. brokered a $110 billion arms deal that should be fulfilled over the next ten years.According to an official statement released by the U.S. State Department, Saudi Arabia is expected to purchase tanks, fighter jets, combat ships, and Air and Missile Defense systems.Currently, there are around 100 American military personnel providing intelligence support for the coalition. However, fewer than 35 are reportedly based in Saudi Arabia. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US has had an alliance with Saudi Arabia since 1933, when the Standard Oil Company of California  now known as Chevron  won a sixty-year concession to explore eastern Saudi Arabia for oil.]]></description>

      <title>Study shows gaming may increase brain's gray matter</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA  Good news for all gamers out there!New research indicates gaming could help people improve their cognitive abilities and even increase gray matter.Researchers from the Chinese University of Electronic Science and Technology and Australia's Macquarie University have found correlations between playing action video games and increased gray matter volume and brain connectivity.According to the study published in the journal Nature, the researchers used MRI scans to study the brains of 27 regular video game players described as 'action video game experts' and 30 amateur participants.The team focused on studying the insular cortex, a brain region located within the folds of the brain's cortex.According to a paper published in the journal Cell, the insular cortex receives input from different areas of the brain, acting as a hub that links brain regions.The insular cortex also manages sensory, emotional, motivational and cognitive functions such as decision making, empathy and self-awareness.Results from the study showed that the 'action video game experts' had superior functional brain connectivity as well as increased gray matter volume in insular subregions.This could be due to the coordination between attention and sensorimotor functions used during an average action video game where players complete roughly 150 sensorimotor responses per minute using the keyboard and mouse.The expert gamers studied in the research had at least six years of professional gaming experience and were recognized champions in regional and national championships of multiplayer online battle video games.So if anyone tries to judge you for gaming too hard, just show them this video.]]></description>

      <title>Indonesia says it will build new tsunami warning system</title>
      <description><![CDATA[INDONESIA  Indonesia says it plans to build a new warning system that is capable of detecting tsunamis caused by undersea landslides, days after waves triggered by a volcano killed at least 429 people. According to the BBC, a government agency said a new system of buoys would be installed next year.   According to the spokesman for the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, Iyan Turyana, the new system will work by detecting the size of waves.Indonesia has had no operational tsunami warning buoys since 2012, due to lack of funding, vandalism to the buoys, and mechanical failure. It is believed that activity from the Anak Krakatau volcano caused undersea landslides which triggered Saturday's tsunami. According to officials, around 150 people are still unaccounted for and 16,000 have been displaced.]]></description>

      <title>Top TomoNews stories of 2018</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE INTERWEBS  The past year has been nothing short of insane, full of big news and truly eye-popping events.So as 2018 comes to an end, what better way to reflect on the year that was than by looking back on all the crazy, stupid, disgusting, daring, and mind-boggling stories that broke the internet.Kim Jong Un started off the year with a bang - literally- by accidentally blowing up his own city in January.The love month wasn't great for one college student, after she flushed her hamster best friend down the crapper.In March, news came out that we may have finally found Amelia Earhart, and come April, one pup reminded us that dogs are indeed man's best friend. Sadly, not everyone is so lucky. In May, we were introduced to the unluckiest man in history, who looked like he'd been crushed by a giant rock while fleeing the Pompeii eruption back in the day.June saw one woman living out everyone's worst nightmare- parasites crawling under your skin.Speaking of nightmares, hearts pounded all around the world as a dozen boys went missing in a Thai cave. A month later in July, the brave, resilient boys were finally rescued, and we all heaved a collective sigh of relief.Meanwhile, on the other end of the bravery spectrum, a 'cowardly' dude in China refused to face his fear of heights despite having a relationship, a new car, and some sweet cash on the line. September got weird fast, thanks to the gross phenomenon that is black hairy tongue.October didn't get any better, especially with Chinese tourists ruining some rare grass for the sake of a selfie. The Chinese continue making headlines through November, as one woman tries to save money by binging on only instant noodles for three weeks. Newsflash: it doesn't end well. December got even more insane and terrifying, with a plane engine cover falling off during takeoff. Can you imagine?No doubt 2018 was cray. But 2019 is probably going to get even crazier. Brace yourselves.]]></description>

      <title>Woman chases porch pilferer, forces her to return stolen goods</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAKEWOOD, COLORADO  Renee Abeyta was home taking care of some chores last Wednesday afternoon when an app on her phone said someone was at the front door. According to KDVR, at first Abeyta thought a delivery person had dropped something off, but when she checked outside, she didn't see anything. She then checked the Ring app on her phone, which uses a camera device to monitor and record events outside a residence.  Turns out someone was helping herself to a package on Renee's front porch. By the time Abeyta got outside, sticky fingers was crossing the street to get away. Abeyta hopped in her ride and drove after the woman, parked, and then confronted the porch pirate. With her phone out recording, Abeyta asks the woman for her name and threatens to call the po po. The woman then takes off running, but so does Abeyta, who doesn't give up. The thief finally gets winded and gives the package back to Abeyta.She then walks away shamefully. Turns out the package was just a Crock Pot cover. However, Abeyta said regardless of what it was, you shouldn't steal from strangers, especially considering the time of the year.]]></description>

      <title>Super Blood Wolf Moon to appear January 20-21</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EARTH  A rare lunar phenomenon called a Super Blood Wolf Moon eclipse will occur on the night of January 20-21. According to WCPO, a super blood wolf moon eclipse is actually three separate phenomena happening at the same time: a lunar eclipse, a super moon and a wolf moon. A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, casting the moon completely in the Earth's shadow and giving it a reddish, "bloody" glow. A supermoon occurs when the moon is within 90 percent of its closest possible distance to the Earth, which makes it look bigger in the sky.   The "wolf moon" refers to the first full moon of the year. This year's full moon will also occur at the same time as the lunar eclipse and a supermoon. According to EarthSky, the umbral lunar eclipse will last just over three-and-a-half hours with totality occurring for about an hour. This is when the moon sits in the shadow of our planet, causing the moon to have a reddish glow as a result of light scattering. The lunar event will be visible for all of North America, and parts of Europe and Africa. The Middle East and other parts of Africa will be able to see a partial eclipse. The eclipse will not be visible for East Asia or Australia.]]></description>

      <title>Japan confronts South Korea in 'radar feud'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO / SEOUL  Japan has accused South Korea of aiming a warship targeting radar at a Japanese military plane.South Korean Navy's KDX-I destroyer allegedly locked its targeting radar onto a Japanese Kawasaki P-1 patrol aircraft last week, according to Defense News.The South Korean ship was said to be near the Dokdo islets searching for North Korean fishing boats. The Japanese plane was reportedly in the airspace of the Noto Peninsula. South Korea says the destroyers used a three-dimensional radar instead of a target radar and did not "intend to trace any Japanese patrol aircraft."Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya called it "an extremely dangerous act", according to The South China Morning Post.]]></description>

      <title>Top TomoNews science stories of 2018 that YouTube demonetized</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WOLRD WIDE WEB  C'mon YouTube, it's all in the name of science!From powerful tsunamis to discovering new organs, 2018 was packed with impressive scientific discoveries and we here at TomoNews had a lot of fun sharing them with you.What wasn't that fun was getting scientific videos slapped with demonetization. Because apparently showing you what Otzi the Iceman ate for his last meal was too much for YouTube to swallow. We try YouTube, we try.Since the Adpocalyspe, YouTube monetization policies have been getting tighter and tighter. And when a video gets demonetized, YouTube makes it much more difficult for that regular viewer to find it  unless the video has tons of views. So fewer people learned of these amazing discoveries in 2018.First up on the list: an accidental discovery. Scientists were poking inside a human and accidentally happened upon a new organ. Meet the interstitium, a layer of fluid-filled pockets that can be found all over our bodies and comprises 20 percent of all bodily fluids. You'd think it would be hard to miss.Speaking about bodies, Otzi the Iceman's frozen body carried an interesting surprise  his last meal. Turns out our hunter friend had quite a nutritious last dinner. His stomach contained fat and meat from an alpine goat, red deer meat, whole wheat seeds and a mysterious toxic fern. Yum?Long before our friend Otzi was hiking around the Alps, humans might have been exploring Southeast Asia. Excavations in the northern Philippine province of Kalinga suggest humans were present in the Philippines roughly 700,000 years ago. Flashforward to the 16th century and humans in Mexico are making skull towers. Researchers uncovered a collection of human skulls beneath modern Mexico City. Aztecs used to carry out human sacrifices and then carve out the skulls of the victims and mount them on poles. We can see why this video got demonetized.Researchers also dug up the remains of the victims of a 1,500-year-old attack in the Swedish coastal village of Sandby Borg. They are believed to have been slaughtered by raiders or a fire. Why did we think this wouldn't get demonetized?Sadly, other videos with relevant scientific value also got demonetized. Videos showing the science behind the devastating tsunami that hit Indonesia in October, the effects of beauty products on human health, and even the groundbreaking invention of a pen that can detect cancer in 10 seconds got demonetized.Any idea what got any of the videos in this compilation demonetized? Let us know in the comments.]]></description>

      <title>Elon Musk unveils 
Starship prototype</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO  The SpaceX Starship is designed for satellite delivery, space missions and interplanetary transport.According to a statement by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the Starship is made of stainless steel that, when polished, creates a mirror-like surface that reflects thermal energy.Stainless steel performs better at higher temperatures than other lighter materials like carbon fiber. This resistance to high temperatures is especially useful during the rocket's re-entry to Earth.Elon Musk stated the new rocket would be ready for test flights by 2019. The company hopes to launch an unmanned flight to Mars in 2022, and a manned mission to the Red Planet as soon as 2024.SpaceX also plans to use the ship for other types of missions as well. According to data revealed by SpaceX, it would take the rocket under 40 minutes to travel from London to Hong Kong, a distance that takes a commercial flight almost 12 hours.]]></description>

      <title>Seaweed eating microbes used to make bioplastic</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TEL AVIV, ISRAEL  Every year, eight million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean, but a special seaweed munching microbe could be a sustainable alternative.Researchers from Tel Aviv University studied the potential use of Ulva lactuca algae as a sustainable alternative for large-scale production of biopolymers.According to the paper published in the journal Science Direct, the research team cultivated the Ulva lactuca algae, also known as sea lettuce,  and fed it to a single-cell organism called Haloferax mediterranei.The single cell organism then discharged a bioplastic polymer called polyhydroxyalkanoate, or PHA.PHA is a completely biosynthetic and biodegradable bioplastic polymer. Products made of PHA generate zero toxic waste and are completely recyclable into organic waste.According to New Atlas, current biodegradable products aren't entirely eco-friendly as making them requires large amounts of natural resources like fertile soil and fresh water.]]></description>
