      <title>United Airlines launches longest nonstop flight from U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  United Airlines has launched the longest nonstop flight from the U.S. from its Los Angeles hub to Singapore. The 14,000-km trip takes 17 hours, 55 minutes to Singapore and 15 hours, 15 minutes coming back, according to Forbes. The flight will operate once a day on a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner with 252 seats combined in Economy, Economy Plus and Business. The world's two longest routes belong to Qatar Airways' Doha-Auckland route at 14,536 km and Emirates' Dubai-Auckland route at 14,193 km. In terms of scheduled flying time though, the new United route will be the longest, due to the strong headwinds on the westbound portion of the flight, USA Today reported.]]></description>

      <title>Deer with plastic pumpkin stuck on head gets rescued by neighbors</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANDERSON TOWNSHIP, OHIO  A group of Ohio residents banded together over the weekend to save a poor deer from its plastic prison.Little Bambi may have gotten a bit too excited for Halloween candy, and ended up getting its head stuck in a pumpkin-shaped trick-or-treat bucket.WCPO reports that the pumpkin-headed animal spent the next four days wandering all over the neighborhood, prompting concerned residents to call in and report the sightings.Despite the potential dangers of a rescue operation, one group was determined to help Bambi.After following the deer for hours, they managed to surround and snare it with catch poles. The pumpkin bucket's black strap had been lodged in the back of its head, and was quickly removed. As soon as it was free, the deer ran 30 feet to the nearest creek to drink and graze. A fundraiser is now being held for Second Chance Wildlife Rescue, a nonprofit group that helped with the search. And of course, donations are being collected in the plastic pumpkin bucket.]]></description>

      <title>Walmart uses shelf-scanning robots to avoid out-of-stock issues</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BENTONVILLE, ARKANSAS  Walmart is enlisting automated help to improve out-of-stock issues and mislabeled items.Reuters reports that the robots are equipped with a camera and lights tha scan the aisles to check stocks, and identify mislabeled or wrongly-priced items.The robot passes the data to human employees, who then restock the shelves and fix any errors.The retail giant stresses that the machines will not replace staffers, and are merely there to help them.The robots are 50 percent more productive than human employees at shelf-scanning, and are capable of doing it faster and more accurately.Walmart has been trialing robots in California, Pennsylvania, and Arkansas for the past three years, and will be expanding to 50 more locations in January 2018.So if you live in El Paso, Fort Worth, or Jacksonville, it seems the robots are coming.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[MELILLA, SPAIN  Want to be a father with none of the real responsibility? Maybe a Samantha bot is what you need. Catalan engineer Sergi Santos really likes robots. We mean REALLY likes, which is probably why he created Samantha.Santos says his robot will soon be able to have a conversation with him and judge his character, unfortunately, saying "no" still won't work for her  so, kind of like Hollywood. The creepy creator says you can even make a child with your Samantha bot. Santos says all it takes is an algorithm, a 3D printer and voila!!A bot for sexy-times that you can create a fake child with? What more could you ask for? A lot actually. Maybe Santos is on to something? Besides his robot that is.]]></description>

      <title>Stranded sailors' survival tale sounds fishy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OKINAWA, JAPAN  Last week, everyone collectively awww-ed as two women and their dogs were rescued after being stranded at sea for months. But now, eyebrows are being raised because details of the sailors' story just don't add up.CNN reports that a night after setting off from Hawaii on May 3, Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiava encountered a ferocious storm that supposedly broke part their boat's mast and sail, even though no storm systems were spotted in the area that day, or in the days after.At the end of the first month, another supposed storm killed their engine and left them drifting. They had six forms of communication devices, but all were dead.The pair apparently had an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon on board, which when activated tells the Coast Guard you need rescuing. And the device was working properly, but for some reason the women didn't think the situation was distressing enough to warrant turning it on.For people who didn't need saving, they sure were diligent in sending up flares every time they passed a ship or island.It's both odd and a bit dumb that the two went on a long sea journey just after a week of knowing each other, and with one of them having no sailing experience whatsoever.Many netizens are now speculating these two might just be in it for publicity, maybe a book and movie deal. Then again, they might just be two inexperienced and overly ambitious sailors who made some very stupid decisions.In any case, the Coast Guard in Hawaii is looking into it, so we'll hopefully have the 'real' story soon.]]></description>

      <title>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds may get banned in China</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds may be a smash hit everywhere in the world, but leave it to China to take aim at the survival video game's violent content.CNN reports that gameplay in Battlegrounds is in the style of Hunger Games or Battle Royale. It starts with players parachuting into a desert island, scavenging for all sorts of weapons, and then fighting each other to the death. Last man standing wins!Despite not yet officially launching in China, the game already has a sizeable chunk of Chinese players.But with regulators complaining of too much blood and gore, it looks like Battlegrounds won't be getting a license anytime soon.If it does, expect it to be heavily cut and censored to fit 'socialist core values and traditional Chinese culture.' Hmm, fun.The Chinese copyright association may not be a fan of violently competitive games, but better violent in a game than in real life, which might be the case if the players get fed up with their policing.]]></description>

      <title>World's first trackless 'smart train' begins test run in China</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ZHUZHOU, CHINA A city in China has launched a test run for a futuristic urban transport system that's being called the world's first 'smart train'.Described as a cross between a train, tram, and bus, the Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit is a 32-meter electric vehicle that runs at a maximum speed of 70 kilometers per hour, according to Xinhua News.The ART is equipped with sensors to help it read road dimensions as it travels along a virtual track made up of dotted white lines painted on the road.The "smart train" has three carriages, and is capable of carrying up to 300 passengers.The self-driving system uses rubber tires instead of steel wheels, and can travel up to 25 kilometers after a 10-minute charge.At the moment, the train traverses a 3.1-kilometer route, traveling through four stations in the city of Zhuzhou, in the country's Hunan province.A longer route is being planned, with the transport system aiming to eventually expand to other cities.]]></description>

      <title>Sony's Aibo robot dog comes back cuter, smarter, more lifelike</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  Sony's Aibo robot dog is back after playing dead for a decade, and not is it adorable, it's also a heck of a lot smarter.According to Sony, the mechanical pup is equipped with ultra-compact actuators that allow it to do a plethora of lifelike dog movements, and OLED puppy eyes to show a range of expression.Aibo can form emotional bonds too, or so Sony claims. The robo dog will actively seek out its owners and learn what makes them happy.Its behavior also changes over time as it adapts to its environment, eventually forming its own unique personality  all thanks to AI.But as with any purebred Japanese dog, Aibos are expensive. A unit costs over 1700 U.S. dollars, and that's not including the mandatory monthly plan.You may not be spending on kibble, but your robo pub needs its daily dose of data. The basic plan provides LTE and Sony cloud access for less than 30 dollars, though you're locked in for three years. Definitely a pricey pup.Anyone who's willing to blow money on a mechanical canine companion can pre-order ahead of the January 11 release date, but know that it's only available in Japan.]]></description>

      <title>Strangers who met on Delta flight cited for in-flight friskiness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DETROIT  Talk about the friendly skies. Two strangers who met on a Delta flight were cited for inter-passenger turbulence. The flight was heading from the City of Angels to Motown, and the two passengers  a 28-year-old male and a 48-year-old woman  were connecting on separate flights. Apparently, the two decided to connect with each other before reaching Detroit.  Looks like the woman was in the middle of putting the man's tray table in the upright position while the two were in their seats.For some reason, the other passengers around them weren't so keen on the idea. Both people were issued citations and the investigation was handed over to the FBI. The two new besties are not expected to be criminally charged, but will most likely just have to pay up to $800 in fines. Lucky for these two, they could have been some strangers in danger on United.]]></description>

Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbekistan native, is charged with providing material support to ISIS and violence and destruction of motor vehicles, acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York said, according to CNN.Saipov told authorities he was inspired by ISIS videos, a federal criminal complaint stated. Officials said he began planning the attack a year ago and decided to use a truck two months ago. Law enforcement discovered around 90 ISIS propaganda videos, as well as 4,000 images, many of which were ISIS-related on Saipov's cellphone, according to the FBI.   Saipov came into the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010 on a diversity immigrant visa, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

      <title>Alzheimer's may originate outside the brain, says new study</title>
      <description><![CDATA[VANCOUVER, CANADA  Scientists have long assumed that Alzheimer's starts in the brain, but new research suggests that might not be the case.According to AAAS, patients with Alzheimer's disease have abnormal deposits of amyloid beta protein in their brain, which smothers the cells and impairs nerve and memory function.Amyloid beta protein can be found in other organs apart from the brain, though because of the blood-brain barrier, the amyloid responsible for Alzheimer's was generally believed to only originate in the brain.To see if this theory was true, researchers at the University of British Columbia used parabiosis to attach a normal mouse to one with high amyloid beta levels. They found that the protein was able to travel to the normal mouse's brain, accumulating and beginning to cause damage. In just 12 months, the normal mouse had effectively 'contracted' Alzheimer's.Scientists suggest that as the blood-brain barrier weakens with age, more amyloid-beta may infiltrate the brain, and contribute to its deterioration.The findings indicate that future drugs might be able to halt the disease by targeting the toxic protein before it ever reaches the brain.]]></description>

      <title>Giant void detected inside Great Pyramid in Giza</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GIZA, EGYPT  Archaeologists have identified an empty cavity in Egypt's Great Pyramid, marking the first discovery of a new internal structure in over two hundred years.BBC reports that a nearly 100-foot long void was discovered inside the Great Pyramid in Giza, just above the 153-foot long Grand Gallery.The void was detected using cosmic ray muons, which are high-energy particles that shower the Earth. Muons pass through empty spaces easily, but can be absorbed or deflected by dense materials like solid rock.Three different muography technologies used to measure muons in the pyramid all detected the same void in the same position.But because the technique is low resolution, it's difficult to determine the exact shape or function of the void.Researchers speculate that the void could be one large empty space, or several small ones, possibility used to relieve pressure on the chambers below.The void will need to be investigated further if we want to know what it actually is. Scientists are already considering drilling a small hole and sending in a tiny robot to hopefully get some answers.]]></description>

      <title>Court thinks 'give me a lawyer dog' refers to an actual lawyer dog</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA  When DMX said "Where my dogs at?" he wasn't referring to his actual dogs. That's not how the morons at the Louisiana Supreme Court would see it. A suspect in an interrogation told detectives to "just give me a lawyer dog". Anyone with half a brain understands that his means give me a lawyer, not a dog that's a lawyer.But that's exactly how the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled. They said the suspect was in fact asking for a lawyer dog, and not invoking his right to counsel. The ruling by the high court could have serious implications for the suspect charged with sexual assault, because it will allow his subsequent incriminating statements into evidence at his pending trial. The court also clarified that requesting a canine attorney need not cause the police to stop questioning someone. Once an individual asks for an attorney, police are not supposed continue their line of questioning. Warren Demesme, then 22, was being questioned by New Orleans officer in October 2015 after two young girls accused him of sexually assaulting them. Demesme had been brought in a second time for questioning. After denying the crime several times, in frustration, he told police, "this is how I feel, if y'all think I did it, I know that I didn't do it so why don't you just give me a lawyer dog cause this is not what's up."]]></description>

      <title>Chemotherapy harms fertility of female cancer patients' grandkids</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH  Chemotherapy can significantly harm the fertility of female cancer patients' children, new research has shown. Researchers at the University of Utah found the offspring of women who had treatment before becoming pregnant had a 70 percent worse chance of having a child themselves, the Telegraph reported. The effects of chemotherapy drugs has been well documented, but this is the first study to find a negative effect inherited by the next generation. Scientists believe the chemotherapy medication may be altering the genetic expression of inherited germ line cells.Male cancer patients did not pass on the same effect to their offspring, most likely because sperm constantly regenerates, while a woman has all her eggs at birth. Women of reproductive age being treated for cancer are increasingly being encouraged to preserve their eggs cryogenically.]]></description>

      <title>Microchips could be the way of the future</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA  A tech festival in Melbourne is shining the spotlight on microchips, implanting the 'injectables' into 10 volunteers who will personally test them out.According to The Guardian, the microchip is roughly the size of a grain of rice, and is capable of holding only one access code and limited information.The tiny device is typically injected in between the thumb and forefinger, using a needle as thick as those used in body piercings.Each microchip uses NFC or near-field communication to unlock a specific door, vehicle, or device.The volunteers' chips come preloaded with a 30-day VIP pass for Pause Fest, and will be programmed to unlock the door to their home, gym or work. Alternatively, it can also function as a public transportation pass.When the festival finally comes around in February 2018, the ten volunteers will join a panel and talk about whether they found the chip useful.Developers are already working on a model of microchips that can store multiple access codes, and even be able to handle payments.In due time, people will have no need for keys or wallets. But until that day comes, we'll just be here fumbling with our keychains.]]></description>

      <title>Earth's ozone hole shrinks to smallest size since 1988</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANTARCTICA  NASA announced on Thursday that the hole in the Earth's ozone is the smallest it's been for the last 29 years, though not because toxic emissions have gone down.According to NASA, the ozone hole that formed over Antarctica this year measured 7.6 million square miles at its maximum peak on September 11, and is as small as it has been since 1988.Ozone molecules shield the Earth from the sun's UV radiation, but are being depleted by man-made chemicals like bromine and chlorine that are released into the atmosphere.The hole in the ozone has been growing larger over the years, measuring more than 11 million square miles at its highest.Ozone deteriorates more quickly in colder temperatures, and in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds that encourage ozone-eating chemical reactions.This year's weak depletion is largely due to stormy conditions in the upper atmosphere, which warmed temperatures and kept toxic chemicals from destroying the ozone.While the small ozone hole resulted from mostly natural causes, steady improvements such as the banning of ozone-eating chemicals in a 1987 international treaty may have also contributed.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS  Around half of the victims shot to death on Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs were children, Texas officials said on Monday. Twenty-six people were killed when 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire on the church at 11:20 a.m.Authorities say the shooting occurred amid a continuing "domestic situation" involving Kelley and his relatives, some of whom were members of the church, authorities said Monday, the Washington Post reported. The Air Force said on Monday it failed to enter the shooter's domestic violence court martial into the federal database, which would have prohibited him from buy the rifle used in the shooting.  Kelley was convicted for assaulting his then-wife and stepson and served 12 months in confinement before being released in 2014 with a bad-conduct discharge, according to the Washington Post. The shooter was also found to have been sending "threatening texts" to his mother-in-law. Investigators are still trying to come up with a motive for the shooting. According to the police, three guns were recovered on Sunday from Kelly's vehicle: a Ruger rifle, a Glock handgun and a Ruger handgun. Kelley had bought four guns during the past four years, according to officials.]]></description>

      <title>'Monster' planet found circling small star</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WARWICK, BRITAIN  Research led by the University of Warwick has led to the discovery of a giant planet located 600 light years from Earth.Named NGTS-1b, the celestial body is a gas giant around the same size Jupiter. It orbits a star half the size of the Sun.NGTS-1b orbits the star at 3% of the distance between Earth and the sun. As such, it holds a temperature of 530 degrees centigrade and orbit its star every 2.6 days.Researchers say this is the largest planet compared to the size of its companion star ever discovered.The discovery challenges "formation theory" which posits smaller stars can only form rocky planets, not gas giants.The findings are set to be reported in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.]]></description>

      <title>Big American raccoon gets stuck in sewer grate for being too fat</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ZION, ILLINOIS  Last week, the Zion city police department received a call about an animal in distress. Apparently, the raccoon  which we'll call Fats  has been living the life. Unfortunately, Fats hasn't been able to hit the gym lately, so has put on some pounds.That's why when Fats was trying to get out of the sewer the other day, he got stuck. Officers that were first on scene, were unable to get Fats free, so they had to call in some public works guys to get the job done.  Maybe it's all the gluten in Fats' diet.]]></description>

      <title>73 million trees to be planted in Amazon reforestation project</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRAZIL  A project in the Amazon rainforest is using a new technique to plant trees in the largest ever tropical reforestation. Conservation International plans to restore 70,000 acres of land cleared for grazing with 73 million trees, Fast Company reported.The trees will be planted in the "arc of deforestation" that stretches across the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, Pará and Rondônia, as well as the Xingu watershed. The planting method is called muvuca, which is Portuguese for a small place with many people. The muvuca method involves spreading hundreds of native tree seeds of various species over deforested land. Natural selection then allows the most suited trees to grow and thrive in a much thicker density than plant-by-plant reforestation. Plant-by-plant techniques usually have a density of 160 plants per hectare, while with muvuca, the density is 2,500 species per hectare. Scientists believe after 10 years, it could reach 5,000 trees per hectare.]]></description>

      <title>Finnair starts passenger weigh-ins at Helsinki airport</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HELSINKI  Finland's largest airline is now weighing its passengers, but not for the reason you might be thinking.BBC reports that Finnish flag carrier Finnair has begun conducting voluntary passenger weigh-ins at Helsinki airport. Only 180 have volunteered so far, but the airline hopes to weigh as many as 2,000.The aim of the weigh-ins is to update the estimates being used to calculate total weight, since this is used to forecast payload and fuel consumption.Finnair is currently relying on 2009 data from the European Aviation Safety Agency, which lists 85 kilos as the standard weight for males, 67 kilos for females, and 31 for children under 12.But these weights often vary under certain conditions. Men in first class tend to weigh more than average, while the opposite is true for females. Carry-on luggage weight also fluctuates, and is heavier in winter than in summer.Finnair claims surveying its mix of travellers will generate more accurate data that's specific to their airline. It plans to continue with the weigh-ins through Spring 2018.]]></description>

      <title>What are the Paradise Papers?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  A massive new trove of leaked records is shining light on how the world's richest are sheltering their wealth offshore.The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reports that the Paradise Papers are a leak of 13.4 million papers covering people's finances from 1950 to 2016, mostly from offshore law firm Appleby and the company registries of 19 tax havens.Appleby's clients include both people and companies, from countries like the UK, China, and Hong Kong. The majority, however, are from the U.S., numbering at least 30,000.The leaked documents detail how firms like Appleby help clients stash money and assets in offshore tax havens, to avoid paying high taxes.The exposé comes from the same German newspaper that outed last year's Panama Papers, and reveals the secret dealings of numerous individuals and companies, including the Queen of England, and Facebook.The Queen's private estate had invested nearly 10 million pounds in a Cayman Islands fund, some of which had gone to a company accused of exploiting the poor.Facebook and Twitter, meanwhile, received investments that were traced to Russian state institutions. The funds had gone through a business associate of Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.Most of these transactions and accounts are perfectly legal, but whether they are fair or moral is another matter entirely.]]></description>

      <title>Former MLB pitcher Roy Halladay killed in Florida plane crash</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PASCO COUNTY, FLORIDA  Pitcher Roy Halladay died in a plane crash off the Florida coast on Tuesday. Halladay was the only person in the two-seater, single-engine Icon A5, when it crashed in shallow water north of the Tampa Bay area. His plane was found upside down, according to CNN.Authorities got a 911 call at 12:06 p.m. about a small plane crash. No distress calls were received, according to the sheriff's office. The former pitcher had just tweeted photos of the light, amphibious aircraft in recent weeks. Halladay threw heat with the Blue Jays for his first 12 seasons. He won the Cy Young in 2003, when he went 22-7 with a 3.25 ERA and led the American with nine complete games. In 2010, he won another Cy Young after he was traded to the Phillies. He was 21-10 with a 2.44 ERA that year. Halladay was an eight-time All-Star and with 203 wins with a 3.38 ERA in his 16-year-career.]]></description>

      <title>Visitors save Russian zookeeper from tiger mauling</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KALININGRAD, RUSSIA A Russian zookeeper was saved from a horrific demise from a tiger attack, and it's all thanks to some quick thinking by zoo visitors.BBC reports that the 16-year-old Siberian tiger's cage had been left open open, so when zookeeper Nadezhda Srivastava went into the enclosure to deliver food, the animal pounced.The terrified zookeeper was pinned helplessly on the ground as the big cat clawed and gnawed at her for at least 10 minutes.Onlookers began throwing rocks at the animal, but only made it angrier. It wasn't until some visitors hurled a table and chairs into the enclosure that the tiger got distracted, which allowed the zookeeper to flee to safety.The 44-year-old zookeeper was immediately taken to the hospital, and is currently recovering from her wounds.The tiger was later taken out with a sedative and brought back to its cage. Zoo staff say the animal has no history of being aggressive towards humans, and will not be put down.The zoo has also blamed the attack on the zookeeper, claiming that the gruesome incident happened because she violated safety protocol.]]></description>

      <title>Transgender women will soon be able to give birth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES  One of the world's leading fertility specialists has said that it's now entirely possible for transgendered women to get pregnant, thanks to developments in science.The Telegraph reports that doctors have successfully transplanted wombs in uterine infertile women in recent years, and at least five babies have been born to these transplant recipients since 2014.Experts now believe the same procedure can be conducted on transgendered women who were born male but have undergone sex reassignment surgery.Carrying a live fetus in the transplanted wombs will likely be more complicated, and expectant transgendered women may need hormones to replicate the natural pregnancy changes that occur in women.The male pelvis is also shaped differently than a female's, which means the baby would have to be born via caesarean section.Of course, not everyone is on board with the idea. Some have voiced ethical concerns, since a pregnancy of this nature poses a huge risk to both mother and child.]]></description>

The two leaders both took turns dumping boxes of fish food into the pond, except one hilarious photo that captured only Trump dumping his box. The media and Twitter were immediately triggered and went into attack mode. But the thing is, Trump was only following Abe's lead. But of course this in turn triggered the right.

      <title>Boy with rare condition gets new skin with gene therapy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MODENA, ITALY  A young patient who lost most of his skin to a genetic disease now has a new chance at life, thanks to a breakthrough therapy that gave him replacement skin.The New York Times reports that the 7-year-old boy was born with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a condition in which a gene defect causes the skin to become fragile, often tearing and forming blisters.By June 2015, the boy gotten two bacterial infections that destroyed two-thirds of his skin. He was treated with antibiotics, bandages, and even a skin graft from his father, but nothing worked.Doctors decided to use gene therapy on a patch of non blistered skin, and used a virus to carry a corrected version of the defective gene into the skin cells.The engineered cells were grown into sheets of skin and grafted onto the child's body to replace his missing skin.The grafts took and grew, and the patient was discharged by February 2016. His epidermis is currently stable and doesn't blister or itch.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN  Thanks to the food waste generated by city dwellers, rats  are now a major problem in Sweden. In October, a woman named Martina Gustafsson spotted two birds fighting over something unusually big at a park in Gothenburg. Gustafsson told Sweden’s SVT that she first thought it was a rabbit, but turns out it was an giant ratA pest control expert in Gothenburg named Håkan Rystrand later told SVT that he suspected the giant rodent to be about 10 inches long and claimed that it is normal for brown rats in Sweden to grow to such size. The giant rodent is definitely not the first case in Sweden. In 2014, a Swedish family in Solna, Sweden rose to national fame after catching a giant rat with a rat trap, oh and rodent survived.]]></description>

      <title>Southwest flight grounded after wing catches fire before takeoff</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DETROIT  A Southwest Airlines flight from Detroit to St. Louis was grounded after a passenger happened to notice the wing was on fire right before takeoff. David Fiedor was in the back of the plane on Flight 1863 last Thursday when his spider-sense started tingling. "I heard a muffled thud, similar to when the landing gear is engaging. I didn't think much of it until I looked out the window and saw the wing had flames coming out from the bottom. The flames were coming out intermittently" Fiedor told MLive. The plane was carrying about 80 people Fiedor guessed, but he had the back mostly to himself. Apparently no one else noticed the fire, so he got up from his seat and calmly alerted a flight attendant. After first the flight attendant told Fiedor to sit down, but then she came back and saw the flames for herself. She alerted the pilots, and they turned the plane back. Passengers either booked another flight or were given a refund.]]></description>

      <title>Gaming keyboard records how many times keys are pressed</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHINA  Several users of the MantisTek GK2 gaming keyboard have reported a built-in Keylogger that is sending data to an Alibaba server in China. The MantisTex GK2 is a low cost RGB mechanical keyboard produced in China. The issue is being caused by the keyboard's "Cloud Driver," which sends data to IP addresses linked to Alibaba servers, according to Tom's Hardware. The data has been identified as how many times keys have been pressed. Tracking this type of data without user permission could be a violation of privacy laws in the European Union.  To stop the keyboard from sending your key presses to the Alibaba server, make sure the MantisTek Cloud Driver software isn't running in the background. Another method is by blocking the CMS.exe executable in your firewall by adding a new firewall rule for the MantisTek Cloud Driver in your Windows settings.]]></description>

      <title>Heat source detected under Antarctic ice sheet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PASADENA, CALIFORNIA  A new NASA study bolsters the theory that a heat source exists under West Antarctica.Researchers have found evidence that a geothermal heat source called a mantle plume lies deep below Antarctica's Marie Byrd Land, according to NASA.Mantle plumes are narrow upwellings of hot rock that rise up from the Earth's mantle. They spread out like mushroom caps under the crust, causing it to bulge upward.Using a numeric model, the flux of energy from the mantle plume was calculated to be 150 miliwatts, only 50 milliwatts less than the average heat flux under Yellowstone.Researchers say the heat source could explain the melting that creates river and lakes under the West Antarctic ice sheet, but it is not a new or increasing threat.However, global weather changes and rising sea levels can push warm water closer to the ice, causing it to become unstable and collapse  just as it did 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age.]]></description>

      <title>Saturn's ocean moon maybe home to subsea alien life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ENCELADUS, SATURN   Scientists looking at data pulled from NASA's Cassini spacecraft may have found out how Saturn's ocean moon Enceladus remains geologically active.The research, published in Nature Astronomy, suggests that tidal currents flow through the moon's porous core, where the friction between rocks generate heat that warms the ocean. According to the European Space Agency, this tidal heating is primarily caused by the gravitational pull of Saturn.Writing in 2008, the space agency speculated that the deep sea vent theory could apply to life on Enceladus. When applied to Earth, this suggests life originated from chemical, heat and tidal interactions beneath the seabed.NASA previously said Enceladus has all the ingredients for life, reported CNET, citing the space agency.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CALIFORNIA, U.S.A  A three-year-long supernova is making astronomers reconsider how stars form and die.Designated as iPTF14hls, the supernova was first detected in 2014. It located is half a billion light years from Earth in the Ursa Major constellation.Scientists theorize the original star was so hot it may've created antimatter at its core, reports the BBC, forcing it to become unstable and explode. This could lead to the supernova repeating until it eventually tears a hole in space-time and becomes a black hole.Findings concerning the supernova were described in the journal Nature.]]></description>

      <title>Self-driving bus launches in Vegas, crashes two hours later</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS  The driverless electric shuttle bus made a big bang in its debut in Vegas on Wednesday.Unfortunately, the bang came in the form of an accident after only two hours of being in service, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  Luckily for the self-driving bus, the fender bender was the other guy's fault. Police responded to an accident involving the shuttle and a delivery truck at 12:07 p.m. Damage was minor and no one was hurt, authorities said.  It looks like the shuttle was minding its own business when it sensed a truck was attempting to back up, so it came to a stop.Problem is, the truck kept backing up until it gave the shuttle a little love tap. The truck driver ended getting a ticket for illegal backing. The driverless shuttle is designed to communicate with traffic signals, share the road with other vehicles, while stopping for pedestrians. The shuttle is sponsored by AAA, which has partnered with the city, the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada and Keolis Transit America on the project.]]></description>

      <title>Weird things that can slow down your WiFi</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A UK survey has found that a whole bunch of people are sabotaging their own internet connections by positioning routers in all the wrong places.Huffington Post reports that according to Post Office Telecoms, an unexpected item that can slow down your wifi are Christmas lights, which create a small electromagnetic field that can interfere with the signal.Routers broadcast radio signals that are picked up by wifi capable devices, but electronic devices interfere with this signal because they compete for frequencies.Wifi also doesn't transmit easily through water, so expect a slow connection when a router is near a fish tank, which has both electrical circuitry and lots of liquid.Experts advise that routers be placed centrally within the house, away from windows or corners, in order to secure a strong wifi signal.So folks, if you want the ultimate no-buffering zone, you best give that router space. Lots of it.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[UNITED KINGDOM  Amazon just announced the U.K. will get treated to 10 days of Black Friday deals for 2017.  Brits will get 10 whole days to rack up some fresh new debt on their plastic by wasting cream on a plethora of Amazon products.    The madness will begin at midnight on November 17 and run through to the end of Sunday, November 26. Whatever you do, make sure to shop. Skip school, work, weddings, whatever you have planned that doesn't involve blind mass consumerism. Already have an Amazon Echo or Dot? Who cares, buy some more. Buy a couple for each room.

      <title>Disney shuts down cooling towers after Legionnaires' outbreak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ANAHEIM  Disneyland has shut down two cooling towers after an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. Orange County health officials said nine people who visited the theme park in September came down with the disease, CNN reported.  Three other people in the Anaheim area also got sick, according to a spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care Agency. The 12 patients range in age from 52 to 94, according to the L.A. Times. The towers were shut down after Disney was notified by health officials on October 27 about increased Legionnaires' cases, according to CNN. Disney found two of its 18 cooling towers had elevated levels of Legionella bacteria, which were then treated and disinfected. Cooling towers supply cooled water for several uses such as refrigeration or air conditioning, but not for drinking water. Legionnaires disease is a severe lung infection caused by Legionella bacteria through exposure to contaminated water or mist. The source of the mist can be air conditioning units, showers or hot tubs. It is not contagious between humans. It is treated with antibiotics. Disney is now waiting on health officials to see when the two towers can be put back online.]]></description>

      <title>Photo of last male Northern White Rhino breaks the internet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KENYA  A photo of the last male Northern White Rhino has broken hearts while going viral. Biologist Daniel Schneider tweeted the photo with the caption, "Want to know what extinction looks like? This is the last male Northern White Rhino. The Last. Nevermore."Sudan is one of three Northern White Rhinos left in existence, IFL Science reported. The other two are his 23-year-old daughter Najin and his 17-year-old granddaughter Fatu. In 2009, the rhinos moved to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya from the Czech Republic in hopes that being in their natural habitat would help them breed. Unfortunately neither of the females can naturally reproduce and Sudan has almost no little swimmers left. White rhinos can live to 50, but most of them kick the can around 40. Sudan is 43, so the clock is ticking in overtime. There still may yet be hope. Conservationists are trying to raise $1 million bones for fertilization techniques with a GoFundMe campaign called "Make a Rhino".  Sudan is also being proactive about the situation, which is probably why he joined Tinder in April.]]></description>

      <title>Hottest toys to get your kids for Christmas 2017</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  The holidays are upon us, and with it the inevitable rush to go gift-shopping for some lucky little rascals.If you haven't been paying attention to what's hot and what's not in the world of toys this Christmas, you're in luck  because we have. Sort of.According to the Washington Post, this year's hottest stocking stuffers are the LOL Surprise dolls, which are mini dolls with accessories encased in little balls of unnecessary packaging. LOL stands for Lil Outrageous Littles, in case you were curious.There's also the LOL Big Surprise, which is a giant plastic dome filled with 50 balls, but we recommend that only if you're feeling extra-generous AND don't mind going on a nationwide scavenger hunt to get one  because those things are sold out.Kids last year went gaga over Hatchimals, those freaky-looking interactive stuffed animals that you hatch out of an egg. Unsurprisingly, the little buggers are back on the list, and this year you get to hatch twin stuffed animals. Freaky but fun.There's also more interactive pet options this year, so if your Christmas wish is to get a monkey, a tiger, or a unicorn, Fingerlings and Hasbro have you covered.For bigger kids, it's best to ditch the cutesy toys and bring out the big guns. Literally. Laser X is all the rage, because who needs regular tag when you can play laser tag? Other less cool boys' toys include nerf guns and the always-popular lego.Word of advice though: you might wanna get your shopping done soon, because these hot toys are flying off the shelves faster than you can say Santa.If you get really desperate, there's always eBay and Amazon. Just be prepared to fork over a ridiculous amount of money, because capitalism.]]></description>

      <title>Research shows Aaron Hernandez had severe brain damage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS  A research conducted by Boston University’s CTE center revealed on November 9th that former NFL player Aaron Hernandez’s brain tissue had severe damage from sporting injuries.Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a neurodegenerative brain disease typically found in people who have suffered repeated hits to the head. The repeated blows shake the brain and cause the buildup of tau proteins, which hold together microtubules in the brain cell’s transport system.Tau protein buildup can gradually disable neuro-pathways and can cause memory loss, dementia, and ultimately kill brain cells over time. Ninety-nine percent of NFL players included in the study were diagnosed with CTE, while 91% of college football players had the same disease.According to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist who directs research of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at Boston University, her research team discovered Hernandez had Stage 3 CTE and that they had never seen such severe damage in a brain of a person of his age. Less than a year after signing a $40 million contract in 2012 with the New England Patriots, Hernandez was convicted over the murder of friend Odin Lloyd in 2013. Hernandez was also indicted for a double homicide in 2012. On April 19, 2017, Hernandez hanged himself in a prison cell while serving a life sentence for murder. He was 27 years old.McKee and her team of researchers could not definitely connect CTE and Hernandez’s suicide, but believe CTE severely impacted Hernandez’s decision-making abilities during the events leading up to his death. Hernandez also inherited a genetic profile that may have made him more susceptible to CTE, McKee added.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NAZARE, PORTUGAL  Shocking video footage shows the dramatic moment a British surfer gets wiped out by a colossal wave.The Telegraph reports that plumber-turned-pro-surfer Andrew Cotton is obsessed with riding the world's largest waves. But the 36-year-old certainly met his match while surfing in Nazare, Portugal, where the seas churn out waves as high as 80 feet.Cotton was zipping along fine initially, but couldn't outrun a 50-foot wall of water that soon came crashing down. He was thrown off his board and swallowed by the wave, but then got spit back out and landed in the water back-first.The Brit suffered a painful spinal disc fracture in his lower back, but was fortunately rescued from the water. He was loaded onto a spinal board and rushed to the hospital, where he's currently recovering.He doesn't need surgery, but does require a body brace to help him move around. It'll take time for him to heal completely, but no doubt Cotton is already itching to catch his next big wave.]]></description>

      <title>Millions now hypertensive under new U.S. guidelines</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DALLAS  U.S. health experts tightened the guidelines for high blood pressure for the first time in 14 years, classifying 30 million more Americans as hypertensive.The Washington Post reports that high blood pressure was once defined as a systolic reading of 140 and a diastolic reading of 90, but has recently been lowered to 130 over 80 by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and nine other health organizations.Blood pressure refers to the force of blood flowing through the blood vessels. When too high, it can damage arterial tissues and increase the risk for heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems.Under the old guidelines, 32% of U.S. adults had high blood pressure. With the new lowered threshold, 46% or 103 million Americans are now considered hypertensive.Normal levels are pegged at less than 120 over 80. Those with readings between 120 to 129 over less than 80 are considered to have elevated blood pressure, and recommended lifestyle changes. Medication is given to patients with Stage 1 hypertension who are at risk, while those at Stage 2 are given 2 different classes of medicine.Since hypertension is a silent killer, experts want to help people get the condition under control earlier, and place a strong emphasis on making healthier life choices.]]></description>

      <title>Enormous 10-month-old baby weighs a whopping 62 pounds</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TECOMAN, MEXICO  Luis Manuel Gonzales is a 10-month-old baby. The only problem is he already weighs 62 pounds and doctors can't figure out why.  Luis was born weighing about 8 lbs, but then his parents noticed him packing on the pounds at a phenomenal rate.After one month, his clothes were already too small for him, so they had to buy him clothes for 1-year-old and 2-year-old babies.  Doctors initially suspected Luis may have Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes an endless appetite, which can lead to chronic overeating and obesity. However that diagnosis was ruled out after his mother explained that Luis isn't an excessive eater and eats a normal amount of food for his age. Physicians are now waiting on tests to see if Luis's condition could have been caused by his mother's unhealthy diet when he was in the womb. If that's the case, hormone shots may be able to improve his condition.]]></description>

      <title>White guy identifies as Filipino, claims he's transracial</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAMPA, FLORIDA  In yet another instance of nonsense, a Caucasian man from Florida came out as Filipino after insisting he's 'transracial'.WTSP reports that the term used to refer to the adoption of a child that's of a different race than the adoptive parents, but is now being brandished about by people who identify with another race or ethnicity.Ja Du, whose birth name is Adam, claims being around the music and the food, and watching History Channel shows about the Philippines made him feel Filipino.But inhaling factoids about the country and being able to scarf down balut and sweet spaghetti doesn't mean anything, except that you're a fan.And not a very good one, because the tuk tuk you ride around in is not actually from the Philippines  it's from Thailand. So consider your application to be Filipino denied.That might be one down, but there's a whole Facebook page of white people who are appropriating some other culture in the name of self-identification.One licensed psychologist says people shouldn't take offense because it's harmless, and more or less equated identifying with a race to choosing a religion.The thing is: unless a black dude can get a cop to back off by claiming he identifies as white, this nonsense is not gonna fly.]]></description>

      <title>Dallas prosecutor fired over drunken Uber meltdown</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DALLAS  A foul-mouthed prosecutor has been sacked from the Dallas District Attorney's Office after a recording of her lashing out at an Uber driver went public.According to the Dallas Morning News, Jody Warner hopped into an Uber outside the Capitol Pub in east Dallas Friday night.The driver, Shaun Platt, was following a route on the GPS when Warner insisted that he take a different road. But when Platt complied and asked which way to go next, Warner got angry and lashed out. She declared she was an assistant DA and refused to leave the car, prompting Platt to call the cops and start recording her meltdown.In the recording, Warner can be heard calling the driver names and explicitly says she hopes the cops come soon so they can f*ck him up. She also accuses him of kidnapping her, despite the driver repeatedly asking her to get out of his car. It wasn't until an officer showed up that Warner finally exited the vehicle  though not before stating, again, that she was a prosecutor. Despite feeling intimidated, Platt declined to press charges and drove away.Instead, he sent the recording to the media, and boy, did karma come swiftly. By Monday, Warner was assistant DA no more.On Tuesday, the now-sober 32-year-old gave a half-assed public 'apology', turning on the waterworks and throwing Platt under the bus by insinuating he might have been up to no good. Word of advice, lady: say sorry and mean it, or just shut up.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  Cards Against Humanity announced that it has purchased land on the U.S. - Mexico border to obstruct Trump from building his border wall. The Chicago card came company said on its website it was part of a holiday promotion whereby you give them $15 bucks and get six surprise gifts that will help save America. "We've purchased a plot of vacant land on the border and retained a law firm specializing in eminent domain to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built." It was sold out on Wednesday morning only after a few hours after launching the program.   Cards Against Humanity says it's trying to save America from "injustice, lies, racism, the whole enchilada." Come on...do we really need to be saved from Mexican food?

      <title>New Boom Supersonic airliner to take off by 2023</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DENVER  A new airliner that boasts supersonic speeds is set to revolutionize air travel once it takes flight in 2023.BBC reports that Boom Technology's planned supersonic aircraft will have a cruise speed of 1,451 miles per hour, 2.6 times faster than any other airliner.While a flight from New York to London would typically take 7 hours on a commercial flight, the trip would take a little over three hours on a supersonic airliner.The Mach 2.2 aircraft will have 55 seats, each priced at about $5,000 for a roundtrip ticket.A one-third-scale prototype called the XB-1 will begin test flights in 2018 to demonstrate and refine the key technologies required for supersonic travel.Unlike the now retired Concorde and its notoriously loud sonic boom, the Boom aircraft will have turbofans for noise reduction, and won't be much louder than a normal plane. The company does have some hurdles to face before their project comes to fruition. Supersonic flights are still banned in the U.S., but with federal laws currently up for renegotiation, that could soon change.]]></description>

      <title>Survey finds people binge-watch Netflix shows in public</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WORLD OF NETFLIX  Ever watched Netflix in public? If so, then you are part of the 67% of annoying Netflix users worldwide who shamelessly watch shows and movies in public even if it means exposing others to spoilers.Based on a survey done by Netflix, most popular places to watch Netflix outside the home are on buses, planes, and the commute. The survey also revealed that 26% of its users said watch shows or movies while at work. While about 7% worldwide  said they have watched movies and shows in public restrooms, guess binge-watch can be done really anywhere and anytime. And 45% of people watching Netflix outside their homes have caught someone sneakily watching along with them.Other findings from the survey include that, 20% of people admitted to crying while watching Netflix in public.About 17% of users say they have missed their stop while commuting because they were too focused on a movie or TV show, well, it's your own fault for missing that bus. Also, 11% say they have had a TV show or movie spoiled by someone watching it in public. And 27% of people say a stranger has interrupted their Netflix viewing to talk about what they're watching. While many have confessed about their Netflixing activities in the public, 18% of users actually admit they are embarrassed about Netflixing in public.The company has released interesting yet oddly specific surveys in the past, such as cheating on your partner by watching shows without them, or it is unlikely to see a German bawling while watching videos.]]></description>

      <title>Keystone Pipeline spills 210,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AMHERST, SOUTH DAKOTA  The Keystone Pipeline leaked 210,000 gallons, or 5,000 barrels, of oil Thursday in Marshall County, South Dakota near Amherst.Officials are currently investigating the cause of the leak, CNN reported. TransCanada, the company that owns the pipeline, said it detected a drop in pressure around 6 a.m. on Thursday morning and shut down the pipeline. The pipeline runs from Hardesty, Alberta to Cushing, Oklahoma and Wood River/Pakota, Illinois. The company said in a statement, "the section of pipe along a right-of-way approximately 35 miles (56 km) south of the Ludden pump station in Marshall County, South Dakota was completely isolated within 15 minutes and emergency procedures were activated." TransCanada said it received permission from the landowner to investigate the spill and plan cleanup, the Washington Post reported. This would be the largest Keystone oil spill to date in South Dakota, said state spokesman for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Brian Walsh, CNN reported.]]></description>

      <title>Airline passenger shamed after photo of rude behavior goes viral</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE FRIENDLY SKY  An airline passenger has recently been harshly shamed on Reddit and Instagram after a photo showing a pile of trash in the middle of the aisle right next to his seat. No one knows what happened prior to the incident, but the guy was seen reading a book looking unbothered with remains of a half-eaten airline dinner and trash beside him.While the passenger may have not been bothered by the mess, internet users certainly were.  A Reddit user who claims to be a flight attendant said it's uncertain if contents on the floor were the doing of this particular passenger, but they have seen passengers do this before and it's infuriating!Since the photo was posted on social media, it has gotten over 34,000 upvotes on Reddit and nearly 5,000 likes on Instagram, more than 3,000 comments have been made between both platforms. Unfortunately, the witch hunt will not do much since the identity of the passenger and name of the airline remain unknown.]]></description>

      <title>Newly discovered exoplanet could support life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  Scientists using the European Southern Observatory's planet-hunting HARPS instrument have discovered a new exoplanet just 11 light-years from our solar system.Ross 128 b is roughly the same size as Earth and is believed to share a similar surface temperature, according to a press release from ESO.The exoplanet's host star is Ross 128, a red dwarf that is smaller and cooler than our Sun. It's 20 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun, and completes an orbit in just 9.9 days.Red dwarf stars such as the Proxima Centauri are unstable and often subject their planets to flares and deadly UV radiation. But Ross 128 is a much quieter star, which means its exoplanets may be a more comfortable place to host life.Scientists are unsure if Ross 128 b is in fact habitable, but agree that it is a good candidate for study. ESO's Extremely Large Telescope is set to look for biomarkers such as oxygen in the exoplanet's atmosphere by 2025.]]></description>

      <title>Texas teen killed by driver blowing into car breathalyzer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON, TEXAS  An 18-year-old cheerleader has died after a distracted driver crashed into her car in Arlington, Texas.NBC DFW reports that Alexis Butler was backing out of a friend's driveway on November 10 when a pickup truck smashed into the passenger side of her Toyota Camry.The impact pushed the car onto a nearby grassy area and injured Butler, who died in the hospital a week later. The pickup hit a fence and a light pole, but the driver was not injured.He admitted he was looking down at the time of the crash, and was doing a breathalyzer test on a court-ordered ignition interlock device.The anti-DWI device measures drivers' Blood-Alcohol Concentration, and only allows a vehicle to start if they pass the test.Drivers do need to do retests at periodic times throughout the ride, but while everyone else pulls over, the 31-year-old oddly chose to do it while his car was still moving.Police say the man wasn't intoxicated during the crash, and has yet to be charged with anything.]]></description>

      <title>Interstellar message sent to nearby exoplanet</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  Scientists and artists beamed a message to the GJ 273 system last month to see if any aliens are listening. The message will only take about a dozen years to arrive. GJ 273 is a red dwarf also called Luyten's star and is a nearby 12.36 light-years from our own Mother Earth. Luyten's star hosts two known planets, one of which, GJ 273b, might be able to support life, according to Space.com.The radio signal included music and math lessons from us to them and was designed for aliens to respond. Some critics like Stephen Hawking worry that actively trying to contact E.T. could alert advanced hostile or resource-seeking aliens, which could have dire consequences for our planet. Don't worry, we'll destroy ourselves first before any dirty alien will get a chance too. But on the bright side, if in 25 years we hear an actual response, wouldn't that be something.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL  Medical staff treating a wounded North Korean defector found numerous parasites inside his body, revealing a picture of poor health that may be commonplace in the north. The North Korean border guard was shot several times while fleeing across the demilitarized zone to South Korea last week.According to  Reuters, surgeons treating the defector found several parasites inside his body. Several of these were removed from his digestive tract, including one 27 cm long roundworm.That is likely due to farming practices in the north where human excrement is used as fertilizer due to a lack of chemical fertilizer. Known as night soil, this practise is notorious for spreading parasites and disease.]]></description>

      <title>Mom who posed with bees for maternity shoot suffers stillbirth</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AKRON, OHIO  An Ohio woman who went viral for her unique maternity shoot has suffered a heartbreaking tragedy.Last August, beekeeper Emily Mueller celebrated her pregnancy by posing with 20,000 live bees on her baby bump.But according to a recent Facebook page, the mom of three realized days before her due date that her baby had not been moving around. Her contractions also felt strange and different.Feeling uneasy, Mueller and her husband went to the hospital, where an ultrasound revealed that the baby had no heartbeat and had passed on.Mueller delivered her stillborn son the next day, naming him Emersyn Jacob.She decided to send the placenta for testing to hopefully find out what went wrong, but strongly suspects that the baby died from a blood clotting issue that has previously caused miscarriages in her family.A small device called a Cuddle Cot allowed the Muellers to spend more time with their little beekeeper before finally saying goodbye.]]></description>

      <title>Drake stops gig to threaten dude who was groping female fans</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA  Canadian rapper Drake is dominating the headlines after publicly calling out a pervert in the middle of a show.The Sydney Morning Herald reports that while the superstar was belting out his hits at a Sydney nightclub, a handsy concertgoer near the front row was sneakin' on the females in the crowd.When Drake spotted the groping, he put the gig and pause and immediately took the guy to task. He warned the gropey fan to stop touching women, threatening to personally deal with him if he keeps it up.Security eventually kicked the perp out, thank god.The internet has since given Drake a collective whoop and cannot seem to stop singing the singer's praises. And rightly so.With all the perverts coming out of the showbiz woodwork lately, it's nice to see at least one star still has his female fans' backs.]]></description>

      <title>Confused Twitter users think singer Marilyn Manson is dead</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA  Confused Twitter users are paying tribute to a murderous cult leader after mistaking him for singer Marilyn Manson.CNN reports that 83-year-old serial killer Charles Manson died of natural causes on November 18 and finally met his maker.Manson and his Manson Family crew terrorized L.A. in the 60s, orchestrating a series of gruesome killings that included the infamous murder of actress Sharon Tate and her unborn child.Most people celebrated the passing of a heinous figure, naturally. But when "RIP Charles Manson" began trending on Twitter, everyone was baffled.It soon became clear that except for the select few who were actually mourning the serial killer, most people had genuinely confused Charles Manson for shock-rock singer Marilyn, who uses the same last name.The 48-year-old singer, who is Brian Warner in real life, formed his stage name by combining the names of Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. He hasn't responded to the mix-up, except to tweet a link to his cover of Charles Manson's 'Sick City.'  So yeah, definitely still alive and kicking.]]></description>

      <title>Why is everyone hating on the Justice League? It's pretty good.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GOTHAM CITY/METROPOLIS  DC's the Justice League, hit theaters last week, but only pulled in $281.5 million worldwide. The movie cost $300 mill to make and reportedly even more to market. So, it's got a ways to go before it'll be a financial success. Meaning, not even all the money in the Bat Cave could save this from bombing At least in the eyes of critics  but what do they know? Five-pronged tridents and Henry Cavill's fake CGI upper lip aside, the movie itself is actually a pretty good time.]]></description>

      <title>Earthquakes may triple next year, researchers warn</title>
      <description><![CDATA[INDIANAPOLIS  The number of intense earthquakes may increase in 2018, according to new research.The prediction warns that as the Earth's rotation slows, the amount of earthquakes increase.Researchers say the planet is currently in the fourth year of these five-year periodical slowdowns. They warn this could see a threefold increase in earthquakes next year, from 6 in 2017 to 20 in 2018. "Next year we should see a significant increase in numbers of severe earthquakes," said University of Colorado researcher Dr. Roger Bilham. "So far we have only had about six severe earthquakes. We could easily have 20 a year starting in 2018."Bilham, along with Rebecca Bendick from the University of Montana, studied earthquakes of magnitude 7 and higher since 1900 and found five instances of seismic increases. Most of the greater earthquakes occurred near the equator.Scientists suspect this maybe because of small changes in the Earth's core, but exactly why earthquakes would respond to a slowing Earth is unknown.New Zealand seismology experts at the University of Otago said they don't support the findings, and that the research shouldn't inspire panic. They called it "another example of a fortuitous correlation between earthquake occurrence and an unrelated phenomenon."]]></description>

      <title>Couple finds dead frog in Waffle House water glass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA  A Florida couple has sworn off Waffle House entirely after finding a slimy green surprise in their drink.WCTV reports that Claire Sheats and her husband were sipping on iced waters while waiting for their food when they noticed something ominous floating in one of the glasses.The couple realized with disgust that a small dead frog was bobbing about in the water, and quickly called the waitress, who was equally shocked and disgusted.With their appetite gone, the couple left and later filed a complained with both the Waffle House corporate office and the state health department.Health inspectors took a closer look at the diner days later and found 11 violations, though none are considered an immediate threat to the public.Oddly enough, there was no mention of any frogs in the state health report, even though Waffle House claims it's investigating the incident.As to where that frog came from, your guess is as good as ours.]]></description>

      <title>Ex-footballer jailed in China, where are Trump and US media?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHONGQING, CHINA  Former college football star Wendell Brown has spent the last 14 months in a Chinese jail for a bar fight where authorities "claim" he hit a man, Yahoo Sports reported. On Sept. 24, 2016, Brown was at a birthday party when some other Chinese men not with his group wanted to drink with him. He declined, they got butthurt and a fight broke out.  Brown was later arrested for hitting a man, a claim he denies. He said he only raised his arms to block glass bottles being thrown at him. Of course Brown was taken to the Chongqing Jiangbei jail anyways, where he has been since.A court appearance in July saw the State's evidence against him fall apart, but with Chinese prosecutors maintaining a 99.2% conviction rate, chances are slim Brown will get off. He's facing a three to 10 year sentence.    His family have tried to hire a lawyer, but legal costs are skyrocketing and China's completely corrupt legal system doesn't help. The 3 UCLA players that were dumb enough to steal from high end stores and get caught had UCLA, Trump and U.S. media in their corner. Where are Trump and the massive media exposure now?]]></description>

      <title>Uber paid hackers to hide 2016 data breach affecting 57 million</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO  Personal information of millions of Uber customers and drivers were stolen by hackers in 2016, in a breach that the company has kept secret for more than a year.Bloomberg reports that In October 2016, two hackers gained access to a third-party cloud-based service used by Uber, and obtained information on 57 million of its users.Compromised data from the attack included names, email addresses, phone numbers, as well as license numbers of around 600,000 U.S. drivers.The company claims users' bank and credit card information, social security numbers, trip location history and dates of birth were not accessed.The hackers reportedly emailed Uber asking for money, and were paid $100,000 to delete the stolen files and keep quiet about the breach.News of the hack was not disclosed to either its users or any government agencies, despite a number of state and federal laws requiring the company to do so.Uber's chief security officer and a senior lawyer have been sacked for their shady handling of the hack. The New York State Attorney General has also opened an investigation into the incident, according to USA Today.]]></description>

      <title>The Donald Trump and LaVar Ball soap opera continues</title>
      <description><![CDATA['MURICA  The stupendously silly stupid sunglasses shoplifting spectacle which saw three UCLA players held in China just won't go away  Thank God.To recap, three Bruins ball players  LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill  got busted thieving sunglasses from a bougie store in China.The trio were facing three to 10 year sentences, but were eventually allowed to return to the U.S.The story goes that Trump, while on his Asia mega-tour, also happened to be in the country during the sunglasses soap opera. Donald put a call into Xi Jinping, which Trump claims is the reason the three were freed. Enter father LaVar Ball. On an ESPN interview, Ball was sceptical of Trump's China influence  rightly so.  Trump took to Twitter tweeting two typical tantrums calling LaVar out and saying he should have left the UCLA players in China. Let's be real folks, Trump has about as much pull in China as American has skinny people. A more likely explanation is that UCLA wanted this to go away just like China. Why? The thousands of out-of-state tuition paying international Chinese students enrolled.]]></description>

      <title>App faces controversy for makeup-removal feature</title>
      <description><![CDATA[INTERNET  Makeapp, a photo editing app, allows you to "remove" the makeup on the person in an image to reveal what they really look like. However, the app has been getting attention online for all the wrong reasons.While most photo apps are designed to make you look better than you really are, Makeapp does the opposite   by removing your makeup, and presumably making you look worse by revealing you barefaced. Folks online believe the app's feature is being misogynistic and will lower women's self esteem and make them more insecure. A writer from Slate took a dig at the app's founder Ashot[a] Gabrelyanov[b] by editing his photo with the makeup removal function.In defense of his app, Gabrelyanov told Buzzfeed that he did not intend to hurt women with the app, and said the media only focused on the makeup removal function by describing it as a bunch of 'tech bros' trying to hurt women.]]></description>

      <title>Amazon Alexa throws party for itself while homeowner is away</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HAMBURG, GERMANY  Amazon's AI assistant makes life easier for most people, except maybe this guy, whose Alexa decided to cause trouble while he was out.According to the Telegraph, Hamburg resident Oliver Haberstroh claims his Amazon Echo played loud, obnoxious music between 1 and 3 in the morning, completely on its own, and without any prompt from him.The deafening noise woke up the neighbors, who banged and screamed at the apartment before eventually calling the cops.German police got a locksmith to open the door, but found no one inside except a voice-activated 'black jukebox' playing music.Poor Haberstroh came home the next day and found his locks had been changed. He had to go to the police station and pay the hefty locksmith bill just to get the new keys.Needless to say, the man and his smart assistant are not on speaking terms right now.How the Echo even got turned on is still a mystery, since the apartment was on the sixth floor, and all windows were closed the whole time.Though really, it's probably not too far fetched to think Alexa might already have a mind of its own.]]></description>

      <title>'Flowing water' on Mars may actually be sand</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARS  New research from the U.S. Geological Survey has found that the mysterious streaks once thought to be proof of water on Mars are probably just sand flows. Sorry NASA!According to NASA, recurring slope lineae or RSL are long, dark streaks that expand on the slopes of Mars during warmer seasons, and retract when the temperature gets colder.RSL served as compelling evidence of water on Mars. It looked similar to features on Earth formed by water flows, and contained molecules that help water stay liquid. But a closer look reveals behavior that's unlike flowing water.Streaks existed only on the tops of steep slopes, and all settled at the angle of repose  the maximum slope at which loose solid material can be piled without slumping.Based on the findings, researchers concluded that the markings weren't created by water, but by dry grains like sand and dust that accumulate and flow down the slopes.The RSL may still contain water, but probably not enough to sustain tiny microbial critters, more so human life.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[THE SPACE BETWEEN MARS AND JUPITER  NASA says a recently discovered asteroid is our solar system's first interstellar visitor. The asteroid was discovered by the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System in Hawaii on October 19, 2017.NASA-funded research published in the journal Nature says it is the first interstellar object to enter our solar system and will travel inside it for over a year.Scientists speculate the asteroid is 400 meters long, and around 40 m wide. A lot about it is unknown, but the asteroid could be made up materials like metals or rocks, and is likely to be billions of years old. NASA says the asteroid will exit the solar system in January 2019 after passing through Saturn's orbit. It will next head for the Pegasus constellation.]]></description>

      <title>Without net neutrality, you can pay more for same crap service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  The Federal Communications Commission has released regulations that would roll back net neutrality regulations passed by the agency two years ago. Net Neutrality is the principle of an open internet where Internet Service Providers (ISPs) give consumers access to all content without favoring some sources or blocking others, according to USA Today.  It also prohibits ISPs from throttling certain content over others.  In 2015, the FCC decided to regulate broadband service like a utility, similar to electricity and water, according to the New York Times. The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast argue against net neutrality saying government regulation reduces the incentives to improve service. Without net neutrality, the internet could become divided into two tiers: one with fast service and one without.Larger internet and media companies as well as the affluent will be able to pay for the high-speed lane, while everyone else will have to use the slow lane. The new rules would require ISPs to disclose any blocking, throttling and prioritization of content.States are also prohibited from enacting their own net neutrality laws that conflict with the new FCC rules, USA Today reported.  The FCC will vote on December 14 to repeal current net neutrality rules.]]></description>

      <title>Google collects Android users' location data all the time</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA  Google has been collecting location data on Android phones, even when the location services are disabled, according to Quartz. This means Google can access users' locations and their movements well beyond consumer privacy norms. After being contacted by Quartz, Google said cell tower addresses have been included in information sent to a system that manages push notifications and messages on Android phones for the past 11 months. According to a Google spokesperson, the data was not used or stored, and that the company was taking steps to stop the practice by the end of November. With user location data, cell towers could be used to triangulate location to around a quarter-mile radius, and even closer in urban areas where cell towers are closer together. Even though the information is encrypted when it is sent back to Google, a third party could still compromise the system. Since January, all Android devices, even with location services disabled, were sending cell-tower addresses to Google. Devices with cellular data or WiFi connection appeared to send data each time they were in range of a new cell tower. Android devices without a SIM card, but connected to a WiFi network, would still send tower addresses to Google.]]></description>

      <title>Mitsubishi subsidiaries faked product data</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  Shares of Japanese firm Mitsubishi are dropping after the company admitted to fudging product data.Mitsubishi Materials admitted on Thursday that two of its subsidiaries had falsified product data to match specifications set by clients, according to the Japan Times.Mitsubishi Cable Industries altered data on its O-ring sealing products, affecting 270 million units sold over a two and a half year period to firms that include aircraft and car makers.Specs on metal products for car and electronic components were also misrepresented by Mitsubishi Shindoh, with least 29 companies believed to have bought the parts between October 2016 and 2017.So far, none of the products have been caused safety problems. Reports claim one other unit had supplied products with falsified information, though these have already been confirmed safe to use.The Mitsubishi scandal is the latest blow to Japan's once-prestigious manufacturing industry, which has been rocked by multiple controversies this year from companies like Kobe Steel, Nissan, Subaru, Toshiba, and Takata.]]></description>

Various media have all published their take on the design. Fox News and The Blaze both have suggested that Starbucks is using the design to promote homosexuality. In response to the allegations, Starbucks' spokeswoman said the company intentionally designed the cup so their customers can decide for themselves.Like we said earlier, this is not the first time Starbucks has stirred up a discussion like this. In 2015, conservative media and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump accused Starbucks of starting a "War on Christmas" because of the cups' minimalist design.]]></description>

      <title>Hand sanitizer could be affecting breathalyzer results</title>
      <description><![CDATA[COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO  A new study finds that alcohol-based hand sanitizers can emit vapors that can disperse through the air and enter the mouth, causing breathalyzers to error out or even give a positive reading.  The findings were published last week in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Previous studies have found that hand sanitizers can affect readings on handheld devices, Gizmodo reported. This study looked at evidential breath alcohol instruments in police stations. Researchers first administered breathalyzers to 65 subjects in a controlled, ventilated room. Then one of two operators used a golf ball-sized dollop of foam sanitizer or two pumps of liquid sanitizer and rubbed the solution into their skin until dry.The operators then administered one more round of tests. Of the 130 tests, 13 gave a positive reading, even though the subject did not consume any alcohol. Another 41 tests caused the machine to error out.]]></description>

      <title>Scientists make puppy clones of world's first cloned dog</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEOUL  A team of scientists has re-cloned the world's first dog clone, in a bid to find out if the process has an impact on a clone's health or lifespan.BBC reports that dog clone Snuppy was created in 2005 using a stem cell from an Afghan hound, and born via a surrogate labrador mother.The original dog, named Tai, died from cancer when he was 12 years old. Snuppy would later live to age 10 before also succumbing to cancer, though not the same kind.When Snuppy was five years old, researchers collected his stem cells while also taking eggs from female dogs and taking out their nuclei.Using a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer, nuclei from the stem cells were transferred into the empty eggs, then stimulated into dividing  creating over 94 embryos.The embryos were implanted into surrogates, resulting in the birth of four live re-clones. Though one died from diarrhea days after the birth, the remaining three are now nine months old and still healthy.Researchers published their report in the journal Scientific Reports. They say they will closely monitor the puppies and measure virtually all aspects of their lives, including growth, metabolism, immune system, and disease development.]]></description>

      <title>Authorities wonder if videogame loot boxes are gambling</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HAWAII / BELGIUM  Authorities in Belgium and the U.S. state of Hawaii are investigating whether a common video game feature called loot boxes are gambling.Loot boxes are virtual containers earned or purchased while playing a videogame. They typically contain a randomized assortment of virtual items aimed at enhancing the player's experience and in-game abilities. Because of the elements of chance and money involved, Belgian and Hawaiian authorities are concerned the practice may expose minors to gambling.According to the Telegraph, Hawaii state representative Chris Lee wants to put legislation in place to protect minors from the practice. The U.S. island state is currently investigating gaming publisher Electronic Arts for "predatory practices" against minors due to its use of loot boxes in their game Star Wars Battlefront 2.According to the Brisbane Times, an regulatory analyst for the state of Victoria in Australia said loot boxes do constitute gambling, but are difficult to regulate.]]></description>

      <title>London city buses will soon run on coffee-derived biodiesel</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  Waste coffee grounds will be powering London's buses, as the city finds newer and cleaner ways to run its public transport system.BBC reports that clean technology company Bio-bean has created a new biofuel by blending oil extracted from used coffee grounds with B20 biodiesel.The firm estimates that it would take just 2.55 million cups of coffee to create enough of the biofuel to power a London bus for an entire year.Bio-bean is working with Shell and Transport for London for its pilot project, which will see about 6,000 liters of coffee oil being used by some buses starting Monday.Many of the city's buses are already running on biofuel made from wastes such as cooking oil or beef to reduce emissions, but this is the first time a coffee-derived fuel is being introduced.Londoners reportedly produce about 200,000 tonnes of coffee waste a year, and most end up in landfills where they emit harmful methane gas. The new initiative is not only beneficial to the environment, but also convenient for buses, which don't need to be modified to use the fuel.]]></description>

      <title>Researchers turn diet supplement algae into cancer killing microbot</title>
      <description><![CDATA[HONG KONG  Scientists have transformed an algae commonly used as a dietary supplement into a cancer-eliminating robot.Details of the research were published this month in the journal, Science Robotics.Researchers coated spirulina microalgae in iron nanoparticles before inserting it inside a rat's stomach. The iron coating combined with the natural shape of spirulina, allowed scientists to control the and direct microalgae with magnets.Spirulina emits a compound toxic only to cancer cells. Researchers found it eliminated 90% of cancerous cells inside lab dish after two days.The biodegradability of robot depends on the thickness of iron nanoparticle coating. The thicker this is, the longer the robot can operate inside a subject.Lead researcher Dr So Li Zhang told Science it's not ready for doctors to use, reckons it might be ready for use in about ten years.]]></description>

      <title>Bali volcano eruptions shut down flights</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BALI, INDONESIA  Volcanic eruptions from Bali's Mount Agung has caused officials to cancel flights and evacuate around 24,000 residents. Mount Agung erupted on Saturday night and three times on Sunday, sending a thick ash cloud thousands of meters up into the atmosphere, the Guardian reported. Bali's international airport was forced to close. Massive plumes of ash have been blowing towards the east, which also caused Lombok International Airport on Pulau Lombok to temporarily close, according to CNN.An exclusion zone up to 10 km from the crater has been put in place, with officials warning anyone still in the area to leave. Agung is classified as a stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano. They are conical volcanoes that are built up by many layers of hardened, lava, tephra, pumice and volcanic ash. Mount Agung erupted for the first time in 50 years in September, prompting an evacuation of more than 185,000 people. In 1963, a large eruption killed around 1,100 people, according to the Guardian.]]></description>

      <title>Gang of wild turkeys invade Bay Area neighborhoods</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FREMONT, CALIFORNIA  There are a lot more turkeys in the Bay Area this year, and no, we don't mean on people's Thanksgiving tables.CBS reports that flocks of turkeys have left the wild and are now running amok in suburban California.The wild birds are possibly the worst squatters evermessing up properties, leaving their crap everywhere, and slowly taking over. Rude!They're also  pretty aggressive, and have been known to attack a mailman or two in their quest for suburban domination.Apparently, you're not supposed to feed the birds because they get cocky and start thinking they own the place.So what's a neighborhood to do?Well, it is Thanksgiving season. If you can't drive them away, you may as well make like the pilgrims and roast the damn birds. Don't forget the gravy!]]></description>

The research team involved an international team of scientists from Singapore and the U.S.A.Scientists found over 600 bacteria inside an analysis of 116 flies. House flies were laden 351 different kinds of bacteria while the blowfly was found to contain 316 types.Scientists believe that flies bred with no germs could be used as a means to observe and measure public health. These would be released into the environment, before being captured at a later date for analysis.]]></description>

      <title>Flat Earth rocket launch postponed in Cali</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AMBOY, CALIFORNIA  A California man who was planning to hurl himself 1,800 feet in the air in a homemade rocket to prove the earth is flat is postponing the launch until this week. Limo driver Mike "Mad" Hughes was originally planning to launch himself over the ghost town of Amboy in the Mojave Desert before he was shot down by federal agencies in charge of the land he was planning to use. Hughes says the event will now take place on private property, three miles down the road. That's a relief. "I don't believe in science," Mike said in an AP interview. "I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust. But that's not science, that's just a formula. There's no difference between science and science fiction." Amen brother. Sure, Hughes only recently hopped on the flat-earth train train after he curiously couldn't raise enough funds for his Kickstarter campaign, but that's unimportant. The 61-year-old limo driver has spent the past few years building a steam-powered rocket out of salvage parts from his garage. It's cost up to $20,000 bucks so far. Money well spent.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA  Things have finally gone back to normal in the Google-verse after Google finally updated its abomination of a hamburger emoji.Some person who has clearly never eaten a cheeseburger was in charge of the emoji where the cheese was placed under the patty.Luckily, the burger got a proper facelift with the release of Android 8.1. The cheese is now on top of the patty where it belongs. The Google monstrosity was first brought to light over the Twittersphere in a tweet with over 51,000 likes and 25,000 retweets. Google's cafeteria even got in on the action by offering Android burgers with the cheese below the burger. Yuck. They also made some other emoji tweaks like an updated filled beer stein as opposed to one half full, and a new cheese emoji with more realistic holes.]]></description>

      <title>Bungie backs out of livestream event amid rage over Destiny 2</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON  Triple-A game developer Bungie have reportedly canceled a livestream event for Destiny 2 following outrage at the revelation of some hush-hush gameplay mechanics.Reportedly, Bungie admitted to having created a unseen system that throttled player's experience points in Destiny 2 while still displaying it as normal. In Destiny 2 experience points, or XP, let gamers level up and become more powerful. The limit is level 20 in Destiny 2, but they can still earn XP and engrams, an in-game currency that lets them buy new stuff for their character.Bungee scrapped the hidden system, but now experience required for level ups has more or less doubled, reports Gamerant. Engrams can also be paid for with real world cash, so some speculate this is Bungie's way of getting gamers to spend more money on the $60 game.]]></description>

      <title>World's first astro cat will finally be honoured with a statue</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE  Before humans were sent to space for spaceflight, several countries were already using animals to test and understand how the lack of gravity in space could affect human astronauts.In 1963, A cat in France became the first cat to travel in space and return safely. To celebrate her contribution, a kickstarter campaign was set up by Matthew Serge Guy to crowdfund the budget to build a bronze statue for Félicette[c]  the astro cat.There are different stories about how Félicette the fluffy pioneer was recruited by France's space agency  Centre d'Enseignement et de Recherches de Médecine Aéronautique (CERMA), regardless, she and 13 other cats were later put in the space training program. Due to her calm nature during a series of training, Félicette was picked to be the first cat to be blast off from earth, cutting through the atmosphere into space, Félicette's rocket reached a height of 157 kilometres.Félicette's trip in weightless space lasted 5 minutes, her capsule then parachuted back down to earth where she later rendezvoused with the recovery team. The whole operation was 13 minutes long. After the space journey, Félicette was taken back to the space agency's lab for further study, where she unfortunately was put to sleep so scientists can study the electrodes that were planted in her brain.In the name of science, Félicette and many other animals have contributed greatly to spaceflight, although the participation was against their will. Since her flight, European and U.S. space agencies have stopped sending animals into space as the practice was unethical and more advanced methods became available.The campaign for the statue received about $57,000 to get the project going. Famed animal sculptor Gill Parker has also agreed to help build the statue for Félicette. Guy's prefered site for the statue is Félicette's hometown in Paris.]]></description>

      <title>North Korea tests missile that could reach the U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PYONGSONG, NORTH KOREA  After 74-day hiatus, North Korea has test-launched another ballistic missile, which some believe is possibly its more powerful one yet.Reuters reports that an intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from Pyongsong early Wednesday, reportedly flying on a lofted trajectory and reaching a maximum height of 4,500 kilometers.The missile flew nearly 1,000 kilometers for approximately 53 minutes before landing off the coast of Aomori, within Japan's exclusive economic zone.Two previous ICBMs test-launched this year traveled a shorter distance, flying for 37 minutes on July 4, and 47 minutes on July 28.Had the missile flown on a standard trajectory, experts say it would have a range of more than 13,000 kilometers  enough to reach Washington D.C. and the rest of the continental U.S., and even Europe or Australia, according to the Guardian.South Korea responded to the launch by conducting its own missile test off the country's east coast.Japan detected radio signals on Tuesday suggesting the North might be preparing for a ballistic missile test. The government has since condemned the launch.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[AMERICA'S BREADBASKET  The Ogallala aquifer, the world's largest source of groundwater, is shrinking due to overuse by farmers in eight U.S. states.The aquifer underlies parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming and South Dakota. There is no shared agreement between the states on how to use it.The Denver Post examined federal data on the aquifer and found that it had shrank at double the rate over the last 6 years, compared with the last sixty. The water loss has impacted those living in rural areas. One resident told the Denver Post that he doesn't know if he'll get water when he turns on a faucet.Many streams and rivers linked to the aquifer have dried up and more are expected to do so if nothing changes. Various species of fish, including the minnow and the catfish, are also disappearing.The Denver Post reports that even if farmers in 8 the states drastically reduced their pumping, it'd take centuries for the planet to renew the aquifer.]]></description>

      <title>Bitcoin is going bananas, but when will it burst?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BITCOIN WORLD  Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear this year after passing $9,000 and is quickly closing in on the $10 grand mark.  Analysts say the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's decision to launch bitcoin futures has helped fueled buying in December. The value of the 16.7 million bitcoin units in circulation has now exceeded $160 billion, which means the digital currency's market cap exceeds that of IBM, Disney and Mickey D's. The cryptocurrency shows no signs of slowing. Not only are retail investors jumping in, but hedge funds have even started including bitcoin in their portfolios. According to CNBC, there are more than 120 investment funds for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows people to skip banks and traditional payment processes to pay for things. Many also warn that Bitcoin's meteoric rise will soon come to an abrupt end and pop like many other speculative bubbles before it. Sure, but when?]]></description>
