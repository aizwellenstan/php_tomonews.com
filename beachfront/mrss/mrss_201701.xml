      <title>Leaked emails show Hillary Clinton wanted to ditch Taiwan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  An alleged email by Hillary Clinton shows that the former secretary of state was willing to discuss an op-ed piece in the New York Times that called for Washington to ditch Taiwan in exchange for China writing off U.S. debt. According to the document released by WikiLeaks, back in 2011, Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan sent the New York Times editorial titled “To Save Our Economy, Ditch Taiwan” by Paul V. Kane to Hillary. Clinton replied, “I saw it and thought it was so clever. Let’s discuss.”  Kane suggested the U.S. negotiate to have China write off $1.14 trillion in American debt in exchange for ending U.S. military assistance and arms sales to Taiwan. In Kane’s opinion this would cut American debt, help the economy and keep the U.S. and China from going to war over Taiwan.  It’s clear from reading Kane’s piece that he is clueless about Taiwan, as well as how China’s economy would be affected by such a massive write off.The WikiLeaks emails did not show whether Clinton actually discussed the article.]]></description>

      <title>Shooting rampage at Mexican dance music festival kills at least five</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLAYA DEL CARMEN, MEXICO  An attack at 10-day electronic music festival in Mexico killed at least five people when a gunman opened fire outside a popular nightclub just south of Cancun. On January 16 at around 2:30am, shooting erupted at the annual BPM music festival when a man armed with a gun tried to enter the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen. At that moment, gunshots were fired in the immediate vicinity, as the lone gunman reportedly exchanged fire with someone inside the venue. The music festival’s staff intervened to protect club-goers, and they themselves were caught in the crossfire. Three security staff have been reported dead.The unknown assailant then fled, as the remaining revelers exited the club, running for their lives. One woman was trampled in the stampede. Video of the incident captured during the frightening scramble depicts the horror. Among the five confirmed dead by officials are two Canadians, an Italian, and a Colombian, with at least 15 more injured. Authorities have detained three suspects, and have ruled out terror as a motive in the attack.The deadly incident took place on the closing day of the festival.]]></description>

      <title>Japanese whaling ship caught with dead minke in Australian whale sanctuary</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA  Despite its whaling program having been ruled illegal by the International Court of Justice in 2014, Japan continues to antagonize the global community with its despicable practices. On Jan. 15, conservation Organization Sea Shepherd posted these disturbing photographs of a dead minke whale aboard the Nisshin Maru, the primary vessel of Japan’s whaling fleet. As the Japanese fleet traveled through the Australian Whale Sanctuary in the Southern Ocean, the ships must have caught sight of the whale and killed it. They weren’t as covert as they needed to be, because a Sea Shepherd helicopter spotted the whale’s carcass lying on the flensing deck of the Nisshin Maru.Realizing they were exposed, the crew of the whaler factory ship tried to cover their tracks, spreading a blue tarp over the body of the dead whale. The fleet’s harpoon ships then quickly followed suit, covering their deadly weapons.The discovery of the unlawful whaling comes just a day after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney. This is the first dead whale seen aboard a Japanese ship since the country was ordered to end its Antarctic hunt, when the International Court of Justice concluded that the scientific research being conducted was]]></description>

      <title>Aussie TV host blasts co-host over white outfit in leaked off-air #jacketgate video</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SYDNEY  Two news presenters for Australia’s Nine News got into a tense wardrobe stand-off after one forced the other to cover up.The exchange happened off-air, but was leaked online on Mumbrella, and is now being dubbed jacketgate.The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the now-infamous clip stars Amber Sherlock, who was in between segments with a guest and a fellow reporter when she noticed all three of them were all wearing white outfits.Annoyed, Sherlock began berating reporter Julie Snook for not wearing a jacket despite being told to do so two hours earlier, dismissing her excuses that she was busy and just flat-out forgot.Guest psychologist Sandy Rea tried to diffuse the situation by suggesting she’d cover up with a jacket instead, but Sherlock was adamant that Snook cover up.Eventually, someone did manage to find a black jacket to put on Snook. The trio was soon all smiles as the cameras rolled, with hardly any sign of the passive-aggressive drama that had been front and center just moments before.]]></description>

      <title>Ambulance drone bypasses traffic on the street to get patients help faster</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <title>Black PhD student tackled to ground by cops, suspected of stealing HIS OWN car</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EVANSTON, ILLINOIS  Police have released dashcam footage that shows a black PhD student being arrested on suspicion of stealing his own car.The incident took place on Oct. 10, 2015,  when driver Lawrence Crosby was 25 years old and studying for a doctoral degree in civil engineering at Northwestern University.Earlier that night, Crosby aroused the suspicions of a member of the public, who saw him trying to fix some loose molding on his car roof with something that looked like a metal bar, the Chicago Tribune reported.The woman called 911, said she felt bad about racial profiling, but reported a potential case of grand theft auto anyway. She then jumped in her own car and started following Crosby.The student noticed he was being tailed and decided he would drive to the police station to explain the situation before things escalated.But by that point, the cops were already in hot pursuit.During the arrest, Crosby was kneed and struck with open hands as he was swarmed by officers and wrestled to the ground. Crosby proved to the cops that the car was his and explained he’d been trying to fix something on the roof. So when they couldn’t pin anything on him for theft, the police charged Crosby with resisting arrest and disobeying officers.Those charges were thrown out by a judge in March last year. Crosby has filed a civil lawsuit against the city and the arresting officers, alleging false arrest and excessive force.The police however, claim the use of force was justified.]]></description>

      <title>Tennessee teen says parents cut off college funds because of black boyfriend</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EADS, TENNESSEE  A Tennessee high schooler has raised thousands of dollars online to pay for her college tuition after claiming that her parents took away her college funds because she is dating a black guy.According to Allie Dowdle’s Gofundme page, she started dating her boyfriend Michael about a year ago. When the Eads, Tennessee student first shared this news to her parents, they did not approve.“My dad did not give me an option:  he told me that I was not allowed to see Michael ever again. Why? Strictly because of skin color.  It wasn't a quiet "no," either. I'll never forget the yelling my parents did, when they expressed how disappointed they were in me, that I could do so much better,” Allie writes on the fundraising site.Allie reported ignored her parents and continued to see Michael secretely. She wrote that she and Michael approached her parents last month, but was again met with fierce opposition. Eventually, their relationship cost her her phone, car and college funds.The goal on Allie’s Gofundme page was set at $10,000, but she received over $24,000 from almost a thousand people in just two days.Do you believe Allie’s claim that her parents simply didn’t want her dating a black guy? Or do you think Allie is simply spoiled?]]></description>

      <title>Video shows terrified dog chained to roof of speeding SUV trailer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FLAGLER COUNTY, FLORIDA  A videoclip of a dog riding on top of a trailer, as its being pulled by an SUV on the highway, is going viral online, and has animal lovers outraged.On January 11, Brenna Cronin was in a car travelling down the I-95, when she spotted the dog up ahead. The dog was chained to the roof of a trailer being pulled by an SUV going at speeds of over 70 mph. Cronin says as she passed, she noticed the letter “S” branded into the dog’s back right leg. Disgusted, Cronin pulled out her phone, and recorded a clip of the sad scene, which she uploaded to Facebook. She then called the police, and offered the cops a description of the vehicle, and the pet in peril. The next day, Cronin received a photograph from another Facebook user who’d caught sight of what appears to be the same dog, in the exact same predicament.Once the video surfaced, the owner was reached for comment by media. He claims he did nothing wrong, and went as far as to say the dog prefers riding on top of the cage, rather than inside with his other dogs. Animal control from two nearby counties went over the owner’s home to do a wellness check on the animals. In some counties in the area, animals must be transported in secure pet carriers or cages. Violators of this could be subject to a $93 fine, depending on which county the infraction took place.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SINGAPORE  Singapore’s Ministry of Transport has announced a partnership with Toyota and Scania to develop and test a self-driving truck platooning system that can transport goods between its shipping ports.According to the press release, the truck platooning system involves a human-driven truck leading a convoy of autonomous trucks. The trucks can be coupled or decoupled to allow other cars to cross between the vehicles. They are also equipped with vehicle detection and anti-collision technologies.The initial test route is a 10-km stretch along the West Coast Highway between Brani Terminal and Pasir Panjang Terminals. It may expand to 20 km, covering Pasir Panjang and Tuas Port.]]></description>

      <title>Florida man sexually abused pit bull for more than three years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PENSACOLA, FLORIDA  A Florida man was arrested for having sex with his family’s pit bull for years before a roommate finally told the authorities. Bradley Hubbard, 23, moved in with his dad and his dad’s girlfriend in Pensacola three years ago. The family had a pit bull named “Baby Girl.” A family member who lived in the home says she saw Hubbard bringing Baby Girl back to his room. She says she could see the action through a hole in the door. At first she would hear the pit bull whimper and cry out. When asked what was going on, Hubbard would say the dog was in heat. Eventually the dog stopped making noises  probably because she was traumatized, Pensacola News Journal reported. On Dec. 28, Hubbard took the dog from the woman’s room and locked his door. The woman heard noises and “could not take it anymore,” so she called the cops. Hubbard’s father denied that his son was involved in any wrongdoing. But the person who reported the incident said the father had covered for his son before. A local veterinarian examined the dog for signs of rape and found that the dog’s genitals showed signs of sexual abuse. Hubbard is being held at the Escambia County Jail on a $15,000 bond. He faces charges of engaging in sexual conduct with an animal and causing death, pain or suffering to an animal. He is set to appear in court on Feb. 2.There was no word on why the roommate waited so long to report the abuse.]]></description>

      <title>Where did the Trump Russia dossier really come from?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  By now, you’ve all had a chance to read the 35-page Trump Russia dossier, if not, you should. Trump blasted the report as nothing but lies, similar to Nazi propaganda. He also described it by his new catchphrase  ‘fake news’  spread by sick people.  But then why did U.S. intelligence agencies brief President Obama and Trump? During the presidential race, ex-British spy Christopher Steele was hired by Republicans opposed to Trump’s candidacy, and then Democrats, to dig up dirt on Trump.         Steele probably did not have direct contact with the unnamed Kremlin officials who reportedly gave sensitive information on Trump. He most likely subcontracted some of the operation to trusted intermediaries in Moscow, who then reported back to him.     The report was passed onto John McCain, who gave it to the FBI. And thanks to Buzzfeed, we now all have access to it. Is intelligence evidence? No, it’s not. Could the information gathered in the report be wrong? Definitely. Is this all fake news? No, it’s not.]]></description>

      <title>Oklahoma man forced to pay child support for baby he found out isn&#x2019;t his</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TULSA, OKLAHOMA  An Oklahoma man in is getting a raw deal after finding out the child he’s fathered for three years isn’t his. The victim of an unusual state law, the man is also forced to make child support payments.When Thomas’ high school girlfriend told him she was pregnant, he wanted to do right by her, and so the two got married. Five months later, Thomas’ wife gave birth to a baby boy, but the two couldn’t make things work and eventually split. Having suspicions about whether his son was actually his, Thomas decided to take a paternity test – the test came back 0.00%. Shocked at how he could be so misled, he took his case to the courtroom. When a judge ordered that Thomas take another paternity test, the results came back the same. Initially, the courts deemed he was not financially responsible for the child, but the judge later reversed the decision. Under Oklahoma law, paternity must be tested before the child’s second birthday. After that, the presumed father becomes the legal father, and DNA tests are no longer of consequence.Now, Thomas finds himself paying the baby’s mama $500 a month in child support, as well as an additional $15,000 in back support, with interest.]]></description>

      <title>8-ton whale slaughtered outside Chinese office building</title>
      <description><![CDATA[XINYU, CHINA  A huge whale was butchered right outside an office building in China for God knows what reason, and now the stomach-churning video is making rounds on Chinese social media.The Global Times reports that the giant animal was a gift to the director of Risun Solar Energy Technology Corporation in Xinyu, Jiangxi province. It had to be hauled from the coast of Zhejiang to Jiangxi province for nearly $600.It was offloaded right beside the office canteen and prepped for slaughter by workers. In the video, a chef is seen standing in front of the enormous whale while sharpening his knives. Two workers were also captured using a saw to cut the mammal’s tail part.The foul stench attracted the attention of locals, who quickly began filming the 8-ton carcass being horrifically cut up.Authorities claim the meat was going to be used to feed dogs, but earlier reports and conversation in the video indicate that it was going to be given out to employees as a year-end bonus.  The Jiangxi Bureau of Fishery Administration started looking into the incident after the video was posted online on Friday. Apart from two particular species, it’s technically not illegal to transport and use whales, which are second-class nationally protected animals in China. What’s unclear though, is whether the company had the required permits and licenses to do so.]]></description>

      <title>Illiterate Steve Harvey doesn&#x2019;t think anyone would like Asian men</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  When Steve Harvey isn’t learning how to read, he apparently hosts a daytime talk show called the Steve Harvey Show. Last week, Harvey started his show by making fun of some self-help books. One of them was sadly called How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide for Asian Men. Just reading the title caused Harvey to break down in laughter. Harvey then asks his audience, “Excuse me, do you like Asian men?” He answers for them, “No. Thank You.”Then he launched into this bit, “How to Date a Black Woman: A Practical Guide to Asian Men. Same thing. ‘You like Asian men?’ I don’t even like Chinese food. It don’t stay with you no time … I don’t eat what I can’t pronounce.”Interesting that Harvey is joking about pronunciation, considering his moronic Miss Universe debacle last year. In his defense, the words ‘Colombia’ and ‘Philippines’ look practically identical.     Hopefully Harvey will get a nice warm welcome when he heads comes to Asia in two weeks to host the Miss Universe pageant in the Philippines. Maybe he should try out his Asian men jokes again.]]></description>

      <title>Huge tarantula caught on camera eating wild snake for snake for the first time ever</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SERRA DO CAVERÁ, BRAZIL  In October of 2015, a group of researchers conducting work on tarantula diversity stumbled upon a Grammostola quirogai tarantula, feasting on the body of an Almaden ground snake. The team photographed the spine-tingling spectacle and published a report of their findings in the December issue of the journal Herpetology Notes. What happened leading up to the meal is unknown, but the researchers suspect the snake may have slithered past the arachnid’s cozy dark den with plans of calling it home. Little did the 15-inch snake realize, the space already had a tenant. The tarantula was quick to give him notice. Her fangs, which measure almost an inch, would have plunged into the snake, liquefying its insides. Once decomposed, the tarantula then enjoyed its dinner.The incident is believed to be the first known account of of a wild tarantula eating a snake in the wild. The researchers report that previous incidents of tarantulas eating snakes have only been witnessed in controlled settings, where the snake would be introduced to the spider.]]></description>

      <title>Good Samaritan fatally shoots man who ambushed Arizona state trooper</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TONOPAH, ARIZONA  An Arizona state trooper responding to a road accident was ambushed by a man on early Thursday. The man was then shot dead by a good samaritan driving by.According to KPHO, Arizona state trooper Edward Andersson responded to a car accident on I-10 at about 4:30 a.m. and he saw an injured woman who was ejected from a rollover vehicle.Andersson immediately started putting out road flares to block the lanes when a suspect ambushed him. The suspect opened fire at Andersson and fought him to the ground. A passerby saw the fight and stopped to help the trooper. He retrieved a gun from his car and fatally shot the suspect."I don't know that my trooper would be alive today without his assistance," Department of Public Safety Col. Frank Milstead told KPHO.Authorities said initial indications are the suspect who shot the trooper might have been involved in the initial car crash. However, it is not clear if the suspect and the injured woman were connected. The woman was airlifted to the hospital where she later died.It is reported that the trooper’s injury is serious but not life-threatening.]]></description>

      <title>Marijuana relieves chronic pain, but can cause schizophrenia and heart attacks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Super suit designed with military tech to give grandma and grandpa more strength</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <title>Burglars outwit guard dog with treats before ransacking suburban home</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PEORIA, ARIZONA  A couple of burglars were quick to take advantage of a guard dog who was distracted by a handful of treats.On December 8, the unidentified man and woman pulled up to the house in their Chevy Impala and parked in the driveway. After knocking and realizing no one was home, the man then hopped over the wall and proceeded to the dog door. He didn’t show up empty-handed, carrying some sort of food for the dog.Luring the unsuspecting canine out through the doggy door, the man squeezed his way into the small flap door and proceeded to ransack the home, stealing multiple goods with the greatest of ease.One by one, the thieves carried the furniture to the car, as the dog watched. When they finished packing up the loot into their car, the pooch watched them speed away, leaving him behind in the driveway. Luckily, a neighbour spotted the dog and returned him to his owners. Police are asking for the public’s help to track down the two criminals.]]></description>

      <title>An animated retelling of Boston&#x2019;s Great Molasses Flood of 1919</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  It’s been referred to as the Great Molasses Flood, the day a tank filled with more than 2 million gallons of molasses burst, and swept through Boston’s city streets swallowing everything in its path. The exact reason for what caused the tank to blow has yet to be known, but cheap materials, faulty maintenance and weather conditions largely factored into the extent of the damage done. Reports indicate that on Jan. 15, 1919, the weather in Boston was a cool 41 degrees Fahrenheit, an unseasonably warm temperature for that time of year. The open hearth steel iron tank, stationed over at the city’s North End neighborhood, stood 50 feet tall and measured 90 feet in diameter.The tank had been filled 29 times before and had received 2.3 million gallons of molasses from Puerto Rico two day prior. Apparently, basic safety procedures weren’t adhered to. Having leaked many times in the past, the tank was painted brown to hide the leaks. A steep price for the neglect was paid when, on that fateful afternoon, rivets burst along the side of tank. Locals said it sounded like a machine gun firing. Suddenly, the top of the tank blew off, and its circular iron walls ripped apart, pulled in opposite directions. Twenty-six million pounds of warm molasses were unleashed upon the city, moving at a speed of roughly 35 miles per hour. Some reports at the time indicated a 40-foot wave of syrup oozed through the city, crushing buildings and overturning vehicles. The molasses was so powerful, it knocked an elevated rail off its tracks and hurled a truck into the Boston Harbor. Horses, dogs and humans were swept up and scattered through the city. The molasses waist-deep, their attempts to struggle and escape the sticky goo only proved to worsen their plight. The warmer temperature is believed to have caused the molasses to cool faster than it would have in the summer, impeding rescue efforts.The disaster claimed the lives of 21 people and left 150 badly injured. Nearly a century later, the exact cause of the tank’s failures remain unknown, but fermentation, hasty construction and thin, brittle steel walls have been suspected as reasons for its undoing.]]></description>

      <title>Hate crime charge for lady who hounded Mexican family on Facebook Live</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  A crazed white woman, aged 48, has been charged with a hate crime after following and abusing a Mexican family on Facebook Live.In November Seattle resident Sandra Jametski filmed herself ranting for 10 minutes while stalking the immigrant family as they were taking their kids to school. She road-rages about the un-American driving, how she’s surrounded by foreigners and calls out the family for what she dubs their “Spanish privilege.”At the most heated point in the exchange, she threatens to ram the family’s car off the road and get them deported, reported the Seattle Times. The worst part is she also ranted at them in front of the son’s school, all for the world to see. She claims one of their kids caused a car accident last year. According to the cops, that crash was Jametski’s fault.Seattle police charged Jametski with a hate crime and threw her in jail. Her bail was set at $500,000 dollars. If found guilty, Jametski could be looking at a prison sentence of up to five years, a $10,000 fine or both.]]></description>

      <title>Flashing the peace sign could lead to your identity being stolen</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>Missing 5-year-old&#x2019;s body found hidden inside family&#x2019;s Chinese restaurant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NORTH CANTON, OHIO  A couple of thought-to-be concerned parents in North Canton, Ohio, who reported their 5-year-old daughter missing have turned out to be more concerned with saving their own hides, after police found Ashley Zhao’s body hidden in the family’s Chinese restaurant a day later. The mother, MingMing Chen, 29, has admitted to police that on the morning of Jan. 9, she beat the girl with her fist, repeatedly. The child’s father, Liang Zhao, 34, then came over to tend to Ashley, and noticed a green fluid dripping out of her mouth. He also noticed she’d stopped breathing. He attempted to revive her by performing CPR, but was unsuccessful. That evening, the couple reported Ashley missing, saying she’d gone to the back of the restaurant for a nap, but somehow vanished. When investigators searched for her in the area, it didn’t take long for them to find her body “concealed” in the restaurant, near the freezer.The mother has been charged with murder and felonious assault, and the father with complicity to commit felonious assault and complicity to commit murder. The restaurant, Ang’s Asian Cuisine, is now permanently closed, and has become a makeshift memorial for little Ashley Zhao. Regular customers say she was a very sweet and social child.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[HARBOR SPRINGS, MICHIGAN  The year 2017 started out horribly for one Michigan man, who spent New Year’s Day injured and helpless in the snow. Luckily, it was man’s best friend to the rescue.The Petoskey News Review reports that around 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 31, Bob (the newspaper did not publish his name citing “privacy reasons.”) ran out in his slippers and pajamas to get another log for his fire. Halfway there, he slipped and fell on the ice, breaking his neck, which rendered him paralyzed.Unable to move, he screamed for help. But with the nearest neighbor a quarter mile away, it was his 5-year-old golden retriever Kelsey that ran to his side.The temperature dipped to freezing, but Kelsey stayed by Bob, barking for help and licking his face and hands to keep him warm.The 64-year-old lost consciousness, but Kelsey’s howling eventually got the attention of a neighbor, who finally discovered Bob 20 hours later.He was rushed to the hospital, where a doctor performed emergency surgery to save him. Miraculously, he didn’t have frostbite, and is recovering nicely  a feat he claims he owes to two heroes: his dog, and his doctor.]]></description>

      <title>Massive python suffocates alligator in deadly underwater wrestling match</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BIG CYPRESS, FLORIDA  A journalist riding his bike near near the everglades witnessed an unnatural sight that has been becoming increasingly more common  a Burmese python drowning an alligator.On the morning of Dec. 21, while cycling, journalist Joe Capozzi heard some commotion coming from a swamp up ahead. He hopped off his bike to investigate and spotted a 6-foot alligator, belly up and fighting for its life, as a 15-foot python coiled itself around the gator’s body.Capozzi wasted no time, grabbing his smartphone to record the intense encounter. He recalls that while the gator would pop up from the water every few minutes, the snake had total control over it, tightening its grip and robbing it of air, until it finally stopped moving. Capozzi says the scene looked like an alligator trapped in a stack of tires underwater. After watching for roughly 10 minutes, a clear winner having emerged, Capozzi continued on his bike ride, and wrote about what he saw two weeks later in a piece for The Palm Beach Post. Burmese pythons have invaded Florida’s ecosystem over the past decade, a result of irresponsible exotic pet owners and the destruction of a python breeding facility in 1992 caused by Hurricane Andrew. More than 2,000 snakes have been removed from the area, but the snakes continue to breed at a rapid pace.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[LANZAROTE, SPAIN  A museum featuring more than 300 sculptures opened to the public this week  14 meters beneath the sea.The Museo Atlantico is located off the south coast of Lanzarote in Spain’s Canary Islands and is the first of its kind in Europe.The 2,500-square-meter site is best explored by scuba diving around it, but if you don’t want to strap on a wetsuit and oxygen tank, it can also be viewed through a glass-bottom boat.The permanent sculptures are the work of British artist Jason Taylor, the Local reported.All the sculptures have been made with high-density pH-neutral concrete so they don’t damage the marine ecosystem. Taylor hopes to encourage marine life to prosper in the area, which is a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.Some of the works carry a political message, such as a piece depicting migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea. The artist said it was a tribute to migrants who succeeded but also those whose dreams and hopes remain at the bottom of the sea.Taylor spent the past two years living in Lanzarote, creating artworks for the museum, and started dropping sculptures onto the seabed about a year ago.He said he hoped the museum could foster a better understanding of the marine environment and how much we depend on it, according to the Telegraph.]]></description>

      <title>Taiwan scrambles fighter jets as China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>Japanese macaque monkey caught on camera having sex with deer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[YAKUSHIMA, JAPAN  A monkey was caught on camera humping a deer in the woods of Yakushima Island in southwestern Japan. What’s more, it seems like the action was consensual. Japanese macaques are known to hitch rides on deer in the wild, but this was a different kind of ride. The video, recorded in November of 2015 by scientist Alexandre Bonnefoy, shows a macaque doinking a Sika deer, humping it 15 times in 10 seconds. Afterwards the deer was seen licking its butt.The monkey then went at it with a second deer, chasing away two bystanders so they could have some alone time together. Another monkey tried to get in on the action, but he was thrown from a deer’s back.According to a study by Bonnefoy and his colleagues, the strange behavior may be the result of “mate deprivation,” when monkeys who lack access to females of their own species are more likely to look for love elsewhere in the animal kingdom.]]></description>

      <title>Ex-British spy claims Trump has been cultivated by the Russians and digs golden showers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  U.S. intelligence agencies briefed Donald Trump about allegations that the Russian government is in possession of compromising information about the president-elect. A two-page summary of a 35-page dossier was presented to Trump and President Obama last week in meetings with the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency and director of national intelligence, CNN reported. The dossier from a former British spy claims Russia has been cultivating Donald Trump for the past five years. It claims Russia asked Trump for intel on oligarchs living in America. They also wanted Trump to play down Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine, which Trump can do once he becomes president next week.In exchange, they would help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton via Wikileaks.Russian intelligence also promised not to use the ‘kompromat’ they compiled on Trump. The dossier said Trump wanted prostitutes to defile a Ritz Carlton hotel room because the Obamas had once stayed there.To his credit, Trump didn’t take Russia up on the business opportunities offered him.

      <title>Alzheimer&#x2019;s drug could regrow teeth without the need for fillings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Uber driver streams bomb-carrying passenger&#x2019;s bank robbery on Facebook</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MIAMI  You’d think the bizarre string of events that unfolded in Miami on Tuesday was from a movie, but nope, it’s all real.The drama began when a bomb-carrying man in a suit, later identified as 35-year-old Enrique Antonio Gamez, took his Uber driver hostage, reports the Miami Herald. The driver, known on Facebook as Mikebilly So-Focused, livestreamed his kidnapper as the latter was robbing the Navy Federal Credit Union. In the video, Gamez can be seen calmly approaching a bank attendant, likely threatening her with the explosive device. The bank attendant goes up to a teller and soon hands the robber a pink envelope full of cash. Gamez tries to get the attendant to come with him as a hostage, assuring her he plans to surrender before then going on a rant about Russian hacking and World War III.Two more live streams are taken in the car, with the man continuing his long-winded rant against the government. The driver tries to get him to show the bomb, but the suspect instead flashes his loot.The pair eventually end up at Ocean Drive in Miami Beach, where the robber makes like Robin Hood and starts giving the cash to random passers-by.True to his word, Gamez then calls the cops, who eventually arrive and take both him and his Uber driver into custody.Sections of Ocean Drive had to be closed off, and a bomb squad called in to secure the premises. Gamez is now with the feds and facing charges, but the Uber the driver was eventually let go, according to NBC Miami.]]></description>

      <title>Seeds inside ammunition will sprout and grow plants after bullets are used</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON COUNTY, VIRGINIA  The United States Department of Defense is issuing a call to contractors to develop biodegradable bullets for military training exercises. The U.S. Army runs through thousands upon thousands of ammunition rounds every year. The bullets currently being used take hundreds of years to break down, while also corroding and polluting the planet’s soil and water sources. The DoD’s new proposal would see specialized seeds encased in the bullets, designed to grow plants that eliminate ammunition debris and contaminants. The seeds would begin to sprout long after landing in the ground, and would eventually become a source of food for animals, too. Through the Small Business Innovation Research agency, the Department of Defense is accepting applications until February 8. They are looking for ammunition designs for 40 to 120 mm training rounds that perform on the same level as bullets being used today. Applications will also need to include potential ways the technology provides benefits, in addition to defensive capabilities.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[MABLETON, GEORGIA  An armed robber was shot dead and his accomplice is on the run after a failed hold-up at a gun store in Georgia.Security camera footage of the fatal Dec. 26 incident was released this week.It shows gun store owner Jimmy Groover, 64, moving faster than green grass through a goose to defend his property and his life.Two unidentified armed men burst into the store in broad daylight, pointed their pistols, and threatened to kill the owner and his assistant if they didn’t get down on the floor, NBC affiliate WXIA reported.But they didn’t count on old Jimmy Groover being armed and ready.In the blink of an eye, the gun store owner fired at the first robber, shooting him dead. The other suspect skedaddled and he’s now wanted by the police.Groover said he felt bad about killing the guy but knew he had little choice after the robbers made threats to kill.Groover’s store has been robbed around 20 times over the years but this is the first time he’s ever shot one of the bandits.Detectives said it was unlikely the grandfather would be charged with any crime because he acted in self-defense.]]></description>

      <title>The presidential state car, Cadillac One, gets an upgrade for President-elect Donald Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  When he becomes president of the United States, Donald Trump will travel in an upgraded version of the Cadillac-branded limousine used by current President Barack Obama.According to Autoweek, the new presidential state car is expected to sport the looks of a Cadillac Escalade sedan. Known as “Cadillac One” or by the Secret Service as “The Beast,” it will use a Kodiak medium-duty truck frame with custom-made body panels.More tank than car, its bodywork is made from hardened steel, aluminum, titanium and ceramics, with windows that can withstand armour-piercing bullets. The interior is completely sealed to shield the president from biochemical attacks. It has heavy armour-plated doors and a reinforced steel plate running underneath the vehicle that protects it from roadside bombs.The presidential limousine has tear gas cannons and a night vision camera installed in front as well as a pump-action shotgun. Extra weapons, an oxygen supply and bottles of the president’s blood type are also on board. The fuel tank is armor-plated and encased in foam to prevent it from exploding. The tires are puncture and shard-resistant with steel rims that allow the car to continue driving even if the tires are destroyed.The new and improved Beast will be revealed on Jan. 20 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States.]]></description>

      <title>Hyperloop One plans full test run within three months in Las Vegas</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS  Hyperloop One announced last week that it plans to execute a full test within the next three months at Apex Industrial Park in Las Vegas, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The test run will cover 500 linear meters, said Nick Earle, the company’s senior vice president of global field operations. “It will levitate, catch the right speed and slow down,” Earle said. “Then what we’ll do, is over the next few months extend that into a few kilometers,” he said. In May 2016, the company successfully tested its levitating electromagnetic motor on an open air sled, reaching speeds of 116 mph, according to Wired. Earle also told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the company is planning to have a full Hyperloop system ready to transport freight by 2020. The hyperloop is based on the idea by Elon Musk of levitating pods that would travel in near-vacuum tubes at speeds of over 700 mph, powered by an electric propulsion system, according to Wired. According to Musk’s calculations, a hyperloop trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles would take only 36 minutes, Wired reported.]]></description>

      <title>85-year-old hero with walking stick rescues two women from burning car</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BURLESON, TEXAS  An elderly man from Texas is being hailed a hero after he rescued two women from the wreckage of a burning vehicle.Lindell Marbut, 85, was minding his own business at home on Sunday, when a speeding car crashed into his driveway and burst into flames, Fox 4 reported.When Lindell’s caretaker Sondra Young ran next door to call 911, the senior citizen searched for the hero inside himself, then went into full-on Superman mode.Lindell usually relies on a cane to get around, but that didn’t stop him from single-handedly pulling the 22-year-old driver out of the car. The valiant senior then dragged a female passenger from the fiery deathtrap with Young’s help and got her safely out of harm’s way.Responding firefighters said things could have turned out a whole lot toastier for the two women if it wasn’t for Lindell’s heroic actions.Speed was a factor in the crash, according to the authorities. Both women sustained internal injuries but are expected to survive.Lindell played down his courageous good deed, and said he’d do it all again if he had to.]]></description>

      <title>German politician proposes government handouts to pay for prostitutes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY  A German politician wants the government to pay for the needy to have sex with prostitutes.The patient would need a doctor to approve the treatment and would claim the “sex prescription” as a medical expense to be reimburse by the local government, according to a proposal by Elisabeth Scharfenberg, care spokeswoman for the German Green Party.Scharfenberg told Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that a similar policy is already in place in the Netherlands. The policy allows those with severe health issues to claim sex with prostitutes as a medical expense, Deutsche Welle reported. Scharfenberg said patients would need a medical certificate showing they can’t achieve sexual satisfaction in other ways. They would also have to prove they can’t afford to pay for sex.But some members of the Green Party worry that niche policy proposals like this one contribute to the perception that the party is not serious. Green parliamentarian and Tübingen mayor Boris Palmer attacked the proposal, saying “well intentioned” ideas like these cause the public to dismiss the Greens as “unworldly oddballs.”Prostitution is legal in Germany, where it does not carry the same stigma as in many other Western countries. Prostitutes in Germany can even visit nursing homes to service elderly residents.]]></description>

      <title>&#x2018;Tree man of Bangladesh&#x2019; gets hands back after 16 operations</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DHAKA, BANGLADESH  It may have taken a year and an insane number of surgeries, but this Bangladeshi man couldn’t be happier to finally have his hands and feet back.CNN reports that Abul Bajander suffers from epidermodysplasia verruciformis, a rare disease that began causing lesions to appear on his skin at age 10. The lesions worsened over time, eventually encompassing both his hands and making it difficult for him to make a living as a rickshaw driver.Bark-like growths had also started sprouting from his hands and feet, making it impossible to do anything except scratch his neck.The 27-year-old has been dubbed “Tree Man” by international media, and is one of only four people in the world to ever be diagnosed with the disease.Doctors in Dhaka offered to treat him free of charge, and moved him and his family to the hospital last February to begin the first of many groundbreaking surgeries.Sixteen operations later, doctors have removed eleven pounds of growth and restored tree man’s hands.He’ll still need a few more surgeries for beautification, but he now can at least eat, write, and hold his 3-year-old daughter on his own.]]></description>

      <title>Video of obese woman towed by  pickup truck is no laughing matter for Kansas City pastor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI  A Kansas City pastor felt the wrath of social media after posting a video of an obese woman in a wheelchair being towed by a pickup truck to Facebook.The video was shared more than 11,000 times over the weekend, but Pastor Lamond Rushing felt the heat after many failed to see the funny side.The whole saga began on Saturday when disabled woman Becky Kittrell’s power wheelchair ran out of battery on the freezing cold streets of Kansas City, Fox 4 reported.Luckily for Becky, a Good Samaritan in a pickup truck stopped and offered to tow her home.That’s where Pastor Rushing comes in. The flabbergasted man of God thought he was seeing a miracle and began filming on his cellphone.Becky doesn’t have Facebook but found out she was a viral sensation when her son saw the video and told her.Becky said that instead of filming her, the pastor could have asked if she needed any help.Temperatures dropped as low as 7 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas City that day and Becky just needed to find some shelter from the cold. After all, wouldn’t offering to help have been the Christian thing to do?Pastor Rushing said he never intended to hurt Becky’s feelings. The preacherman said he’d just never seen anything like it before.However, after reading some ungodly comments about Becky online, the pastor said he understood why people were so upset with him. He apologized for filming the video and later removed it from Facebook.]]></description>

      <title>Flying with firearms? Here&#x2019;s how to transport them in checked baggage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PENTAGON CITY, VIRGINIA  The suspect who carried out a recent mass shooting at a Florida airport reportedly carried out the attack using a gun that was in his checked luggage.Although laws vary by local and state governments, TSA guidelines do allow passengers to travel with firearms if they are stored properly.Firearms must be unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container. Other firearm parts, including magazines and ammunition for small arms, can be placed in the same container. The key to the container should only be retained by the passenger. The container can be placed inside a suitcase but it can only transported as checked baggage.The passenger should check in at the airline counter and inform the airline representative about the firearm in his or her checked baggage. The representative will then have the passenger sign the weapon’s unloaded declaration slip.The baggage will then be examined by TSA agents, while the passenger should standby until the agent clears the baggage for transportation.Despite the fact that firearms are prohibited in carry-on bags, the TSA found 2,653 firearms in carry-on bags across the U.S. in 2015 alone, with more than 80 percent of those weapons being loaded.]]></description>

      <title>Axe-wielding woman goes on rampage in 7-Eleven, attacking two customers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SYDNEY  Police have arrested a woman after a vicious attack on two customers inside a 7-Eleven with an axe.On January 7, Evie Amati, 24, strolled into the convenience store, carrying an axe, as well as a knife in her back pocket. Meanwhile at the register, customer Sharon Hacker, 43,  was pulling money from her purse, with customer Ben Rimmer, 32, waiting behind her in line with a meat pie. When Amati walked over to Rimmer with the axe in hand, he reportedly thought she was kidding around. Seconds later when he turned away, Amati started swinging. After laying Rimmer out, blood gushing everywhere, Amati turned her attention to Sharon Hacker, and clubbed her in the back of the head with the axe. Her victims on the ground, Amati then casually walked out of the store. It wasn’t long before police caught up to her. Luckily, both customers survived the attack, though Ben Rimmer’s face had been opened up. A witness present said his blood was all over the store of the floor. He remains in hospital with serious head injuries. Sharon Hacker suffered a fractured skull, but she claims her thick dreadlocks may have prevented further injury. Evie Amati has been charged with wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.]]></description>

      <title>Salt and ice challenge leaves severe burn on UK schoolboy&#x2019;s hand</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SWANSEA, UNITED KINGDOM  A high school student in Wales took part in the internet craze known as the “salt and ice challenge,”  and a photograph of his damaged hand is making the rounds on social media.The salt and ice challenge involves placing salt somewhere on the body, and then using an ice cube to press down on the area for as long as possible. Doing this creates a burning sensation in the area, as the salt and the ice combined become significantly colder than the ice on its own, at -18°F (-28°C). Once the participant finally gives up, initially they may feel an immediate numbing sensation in the affected area, meaning they’ve likely experienced nerve damage resulting from second- or third-degree burns, similar to frostbite. The teen’s mother published the photograph of the skin burn to warn other parents of the dangers of this salt and ice challenge.]]></description>

      <title>Brown snake swallows carpet python in stunning rare footage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA  Extremely rare footage of a brown snake eating a carpet python has been captured on film … where else, but Down Under?The incident was filmed on Jan. 2 at a suburban house near Brisbane in the state of Queensland. It shows a deadly brown snake taking several leisurely hours to devour his less-fortunate fellow serpent, presumably after a fight to the death. Brown snakes are the world’s second-most venomous land snake and are responsible for about half of all human deaths from snake bites in Australia. The non-poisonous carpet python … Mmm, well, not so much. The incredible scene was discovered by fearless snake-catching duo, Norman and Sally Hill and posted to their Facebook page.It might have taken three hours, but eventually the brown snake finished his meal and was then removed from the house.Usually brown snakes eat frogs, birds, rats and mice but according to the Australian Museum, the species is known to be cannibalistic in captivity and can prey on snakes of a similar size.Which just goes to show that in deadly Australia, even some of the biggest predators can sometimes become the prey.]]></description>

      <title>Look out below! Seagulls in Alaska carrying super-strain of E. coli</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KENAI PENINSULA, ALASKA  A team of scientists studying seagull feces at landfills in Anchorage have found a strain of E. coli bacteria that has proven to be resistant to antibiotics.In a study published in the journal Infection Ecology and Epidemiology last November, at researchers the U.S. Geological Survey explain in detail how the resilient strain of E. coli bacteria has strengthened to the point where human-developed medicines have no answer for it. When antibiotics are ingested, they pass through our bodies and get flushed down the toilet, into the sewage system. However, water treatment plants aren’t designed to treat antibiotic residues, allowing them to make their way into the environment. Bacteria in the environment then meet the antibiotic residues, and over time, they become resistant to them. Animals who hang out in places of high-human activity, like seagulls, then contract the E. coli.The researchers aren’t sure the E. coli found in the seagull fecal matter can be transmitted to humans, but they are certain that humans are the cause of these infections in the birds. In the United States, the CDC reports 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths are caused each year by drug-resistant bacteria.]]></description>

      <title>Five inmates injured at Chicago super-max jail fight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO, ILLINOIS  Five inmates were injured during a massive fight at Illinois's Cook County Jail Friday around 1:30 p.m., in the jail's super-max division.The mayhem began when an inmate standing near the center of the room punched another in the back of the head. Another inmate was then struck, causing his head to bounce off a cement pillar. Out cold, he remained on the floor until someone pulled him away.Nearly 30 men in the general population room were present, but some clearly didn’t want to be involved and stayed close to the walls.  Guards eventually brought the situation under control with taser guns. Several weapons were recovered including two that appear to have been made from inhaler parts. Officials are investigating how the inmates got hold of weapons.Cara Smith, a spokeswoman for the jail, said five inmates were taken to hospital to be treated for their injuries, including stab wounds, but none of the injuries were life-threatening. Four of the five inmates were in jail on murder charges while the fifth person was charged with armed robbery.]]></description>

      <title>SeaWorld announces death of Tilikum, world&#x2019;s most famous orca whale</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ORLANDO  On January 6, the world’s most famous whale passed away.SeaWorld announced that Tilikum the orca whale has finally died due to complications from a bacterial lung infection he’d been fighting.Tilikum’s health had been in decline for a few months, but the suffering he endured lasted for more than three decades. In 1983, then 2-year-old Tilikum was captured off the coast of Iceland, ripped from his family and taken to a marine zoo. A year later, Tilikum was then transferred to Sealand of the Pacific, a former marine park in Canada’s British Columbia. Forced to learn tricks and perform for audiences regularly, it didn’t take long for Tilikum to become aggressive toward humans. In 1991, 20-year-old part-time trainer Keltie Byrne was working with Tilikum and two other whales when she slipped into the pool. As she struggled to get out of the pool, the whales reportedly prevented her from doing so. Tilikum supposedly carried the young girl’s dead body around on his back for the next two hours before staff were able to retrieve her. After Sealand of the Pacific closed down the next year, Tilikum was then transferred to Orlando, sold to SeaWorld for $1 million. There, too, he was kept in a small tank, built to hold only one-ten-thousandth of the water an orca would normally traverse over a day in the wild. Experts say these conditions can lead to psychosis for the whales, and it wasn’t long before Tilikum struck again. In 1999, a 27-year-old drifter named Daniel Dukes had somehow snuck into the park, and dove into a breeding tank with the whale. The next morning, Dukes’ body was found draped across Tilikum’s back, a familiar sight. His swimming trunks were found floating in the pool. The death was reported as a likely drowning, but that wouldn’t explain all the injuries Dukes suffered. His genitals had reportedly been bitten off.Tilikum’s murderous streak culminated in 2010, when SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was pulled down into the pool during a live performance. Brancheau’s death was the focus of the 2013 acclaimed documentary Blackfish, which exposed SeaWorld’s treatment of its orca whales and nearly sunk the company after an extreme public backlash. In response to the film, SeaWorld has since halted its captive breeding program, and announced it would be phasing out theatrical orca shows.In a statement last week, SeaWorld mourned the loss of Tilikum, and noted the “world-class care” provided to him, and that he “lived a long and enriching life while at SeaWorld.”]]></description>

      <title>Speared through the head, this unlucky man miraculously survived</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE BAHAMAS  Alarming photographs are circulating on social media of a man reportedly speared through the head while on a diving excursion off the coast of the Bahamas.Not much is known about this incident just yet, not even the man’s name. Photos of the man in hospital, both before and after the spear-removal surgery, are inciting a collective gasp among users online. Though most would call this an unlucky situation, doctors would probably say he’s the luckiest man alive. Had the spear pierced his head just a few millimeters higher, it would’ve likely proved fatal.Instead, his surgery appears to have gone well, based off a post-surgery photo of the man offering a smile and gesturing with the peace sign.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TAMPA, FLORIDA  After dominating both of their opponents in the College Football Playoff semifinals, Alabama and Clemson are headed down to Tampa in a rematch of last year’s national championship game. The Tigers are out for revenge, although it’ll be an uphill battle against undefeated Alabama.   Clemson star quarterback Deshaun Watson can do it all  including coughing it up  which hopefully he doesn’t. Wayne Gallman will look to tear up the backfield, but so will Watson. The Tigers have a solid receiving crew and definitely plan to get the ball in the hands of Mike Williams as much as possible. The Tide have been rolling all year with true freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts. Bama’s passing is still a work in progress, but who needs to throw when you have an amazing run game. If Bo Scarbrough gets out, Clemson could be done, and he’s Alabama’s third option.    Can Watson and the Tigers bring home their first championship since 1981? Or will Alabama win its second straight national title and its fifth in eight years?]]></description>

Because the animal marked its territory in the house, everyone inside had to get rabies shots, including Morse’s grandsons who were visiting from North Carolina.The attack occurred four miles from where another bobcat attacked two men who were out walking. That animal has not been caught yet, Fox affiliate WTVT reported.Florida’s Department of Health has issued a rabies alert for Venice and North Port. The alert lasts for 60 days.]]></description>

      <title>China is giving its propaganda a facelift to reach out to Chinese millennials</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  As China’s millennials have become more tech-savvy, the Chinese Communist Party has tried to retool its propaganda machine for a new audience.    Xi Jinping has forced propaganda officers to utilize digital media to resist foreign popular culture influences, and to target younger audiences, the New York Times reported.The party has invested millions in animated videos, while Chinese scholars copy TED-style talks to criticize the West. They even have lame “hip hop” groups that suck up to the CCP and warn about America’s efforts to topple the regime. And now even Apple is getting in on the selling out game. At the behest of Beijing, Apple has kicked the New York Times out of China’s Apple Store. Chinese law prohibits the publication of “harmful information”  aka reality  online. Funny how Tim Cook will refuse to unlock an iPhone in the U.S., but turns to putty for the CCP. But hey, who needs freedom of information when you can buy a shiny new iPhone.]]></description>

      <title>Alcohol-sensing wristband lets you know how wasted you are</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>High school principal admits he stole naked photos from students&#x2019; phones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY  The porn-addicted former principal of an Elizabethtown, Kentucky high school is facing child pornography charges after admitting he confiscated students’ cell phones to trade their nude images online.Stephen Kyle Goodlett, 36, was indicted on Wednesday on federal kiddy porn charges after last month pleading not guilty to 63 state offenses, the Associated Press reported. The married father of three was arrested in October last year, then fired from his job after the offenses were discovered.Goodlett admitted to investigators that he is addicted to porn. He said he seized students’ phones and traded their naked photos for dirty images with a porn site based in Russia.The case came to light in September last year when a 20-year-old woman found naked photos of herself online. The sexy snaps were taken when she was aged just 15. The woman went to local cops, who called in federal investigators. The feds then tracked Goodlett down through his IP address.Investigators found at least 60 examples of child porn on the former LaRue County High School principal’s devices.The authorities are appealing for any of Goodlett’s former students who had their phones confiscated to come forward as they build a case against him.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[OCONEE COUNTY, GEORGIA  Motorists had more than just other cars, bikes, and pedestrians to watch out for on the road after a llama was seen running around a town just outside of Athens.On Jan. 4, police responded to calls from citizens of a camel in the streets, but they quickly found out the suspect in question was actually an escaped llama, who’d somehow broken out of its owner’s property and decided to trot along down a busy highway. Police managed to corner the llama behind a dumpster in the back of a restaurant. The restaurant owner also provided a bag of carrots to lure the creature into custody, and its owner arrived with a van shortly afterward to bring the fearless camelid home to safety.During its adventure, the llama quickly rose to fame on social media, spotted by drivers both amused and confused by its presence.]]></description>

It sped past an intersection before hitting a curb and going up an embankment.The white Buick SUV got launched into the air and crashed through the roof of a nearby house, right into the living room.The house was a residential facility for autistic adults, six of whom were home during the crash. With the vehicle blocking the exit, two were trapped in the living room and had to be helped out by witnesses who broke through the house’s front window.One of the witnesses also kept Clodfelter company until officers, firefighters and emergency medical personnel arrived to pull her out of the SUV.

      <title>Black teens charged with hate crime for live streaming torture of disabled white man</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  Criminal charges have been filed against the four teens who streamed their despicable torture of a mentally disabled man on Facebook Live Tuesday afternoon.CBS Chicago reports that Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper, and sisters Brittany and Tanishia Covington, are each facing hate crime charges, as well as felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.The 18-year-old victim was friends with Hill, who picked him up on Saturday from a suburban McDonald’s in what turned out to be a stolen van. They spent the next few days driving around and sleeping in the van, before driving to the Covington sisters’ West Side, Chicago home on Tuesday.There, a “play fight” escalated and the violence began. After being bound and gagged, the victim was beaten, taunted, and tortured for hours. A second video that surfaced on Wednesday shows he was also made to walk on all fours and forced to drink water from a toilet. He only escaped after the perps went to confront a neighbor who complained about the noise.The poor teen was so shaken by his ordeal he was hospitalized, but has since returned home to his family.Authorities sought hate crime charges because of the victim’s mental capacity and the suspects’ racist statements. And though many online blame the Black Lives Matter movement for the incident, no connection has been made by police.]]></description>

      <title>Honda unveils self-balancing motorcycle to keep riders in the saddle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS  Honda has unveiled a well-balanced piece of motorcycle tech designed to help riders stay in the saddle at low speeds.The Riding Assist concept bike has an adjustable front fork that assumes a wider angle to increase stability and its own motor attached to the front wheel, TechCrunch reported.As anyone who’s ever tried to maneuver a big bike out of a parking lot at low speed knows, keeping balance at 2 or 3 miles an hour is one of the trickiest aspects of riding.The bike was revealed earlier this week at tech tradeshow CES 2017 in Las Vegas. Although there’s no plans to bring it to market soon, the concept bike shows how Honda’s investment in robotics can have spin-off benefits for its vehicles.The technology behind the Riding Assist bike was honed in the development of both Honda’s humanoid Asimo robot and UNI-CUB scooter, according to TechCrunch.Personal robots like Asimo are likely still a decade away from being ready to be sold to consumers.However, the legacy technology from the development of Asimo and the UNI-CUB could help bring real improvements to Honda’s vehicles much sooner than that.]]></description>

      <title>Congressman&#x2019;s son drops a dab on House Speaker Paul Ryan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A Congressman’s son was grounded by his dad this week for teaching House Speaker Paul Ryan how to dab.Cal Marshall, 17, is the son of Roger Marshall, the Republican representative for the First District of Kansas.Young Cal caused a bit of confusion at his dad’s swearing-in photo call on Tuesday, when Ryan asked if he was leaning into his elbow to sneeze. But no, like countless sports stars, performers and 12-year-old kids over the past two years or so, Cal was dropping a dab on ’em folks, the New York Times reported.Afterward, Cal wrote on Twitter that he was surprised by the media coverage of his antics. But the House Speaker failed to see the funny side, posting on Twitter that he was still clueless about dabbing. In the end, Ryan got the last laugh. Congressman Marshall posted on Twitter that Cal was now grounded, which should give the teenager time to work on some new dance moves.]]></description>

      <title>What the hell!? Ominous demon photo goes viral on Facebook</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAVEEN, ARIZONA  This photo of what appears to be some sort of winged creature has gone viral, with some saying it’s a demon, while others insist it’s an angel. Richard Christianson from Laveen, Arizona posted the photo on Facebook on Jan. 1. In his post, Christianson asked: “What the hell do you see in this picture for reals ??? Anybody.”The post was shared 80,000 times before Christianson took it down on Wednesday. But many people are skeptical, suggesting the dark shape looming over the sidewalk is likely just a tree or a Photoshop job. However, Facebook user Crissy Love seems convinced of the photo’s authenticity. Love noted that there weren’t any palm trees in Laveen that look like a demon. “I knew Laveen was haunted,” she wrote.

      <title>Megyn Kelly is ditching FOX News for NBC News</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After 12 long years of being fair and balanced at Fox News, anchor Megyn Kelly is leaving to take on a broad new role at NBC News. Kelly will host her own daytime news and talk show, anchor an in-depth Sunday night news show as well as take on a role in NBC’s breaking news coverage, the New York Times reported. The anchor’s move will shake things up in the land of cable news where she had become the second-most watched host after Bill O’Reilly of Fox News. Kelly’s exit also throws a wrench into Fox News’ primetime lineup, and adds to the drama following the Roger Ailes sexual harassment scandal.   NBC is probably hoping that the addition of Kelly will get more conservative viewers to flip to their channel, but will it work?]]></description>

      <title>Put the Q-tips down! Earwax is good for you</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  You know that eargasm you get when you stick a cotton swab in your ear and pull out a piece of wax like candy floss?Well, according to the medical experts, you really should stop doing that.For a long time now doctors have advised against cleaning our ears with cotton swabs. But on Tuesday, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery updated its guidelines to tell us exactly why we should never clean our ears ourselves.Cerumen, also known as earwax, is a natural substance made up of oil, hair and dead skin cells. Doctors say using cotton swabs to clean ears can damage the eardrums and push earwax too deep inside the ear, where it can become clogged.In fact, earwax keeps our ears clean by preventing dirt, dust and bacteria from entering the body.Earwax is removed from the body by the movement of the jaw when people talk and eat, and is washed away when we bathe.So you hear that? It’s time to put those Q-tips down … and if you do have a problem with your ears, go see a doctor.]]></description>

      <title>Female shoppers squirted with semen by nasty pervert in Walmart</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MARIETTA, OHIO  A married man has been busted by the cops for a number of nasty deeds he committed at a Walmart during the final weeks of 2016. The incidents involved the use of a syringe, filled with semen. In early November, a female shopper reported that she felt the presence of a creepy man lingering behind her while she perused the store’s makeup aisle. With her back turned to him, she suddenly felt a sticky, wet substance dripping from her foot and lower back area. The woman ran to the restroom to wash out the goo, and when she walked out, the strange man was standing there, staring at her. The sperm-squirting assailant then took off, but not before the woman was able to get a good look at his truck. When another instance was reported at the same Walmart on December 28, police were able to identify and track down 28-year-old married man Timothy Blake, using surveillance footage and the truck description.After being confronted by police, Blake admitted to unloading a semen-filled syringe on a dozen different women at that location. He claims the disgusting act was something he’d discovered online, and was his way of having sex with his victims. He initially told police he’d used egg yolks, but when they said they had “had the material tested,” he admitted to using semen on at least four separate occasions. Blake is currently free after posting $11,000 bond. He has been charged with two felony obscenity counts, and must wear a GPS monitor as part of his release conditions.]]></description>

      <title>Loyal dog protects injured friend stuck on snowy train tracks for two days</title>
      <description><![CDATA[UZHHOROD  An injured dog that was stranded on snowy train tracks near Uzhhorod in Ukraine was watched over by her loyal friend for two days until help arrived. Local resident Denis Malafeev found the two dogs, named Lucy and Panda, on Dec. 26. To protect Lucy, who was injured and could not move, Panda became defensive when they were approached by the human rescuers. Malafeev said on Facebook that Panda took care of Lucy by curling up next to her, with both of them pressing themselves against the tracks when trains passed over them. Panda reportedly never abandoned Lucy during their two days on the train tracks.The dogs were later taken to a animal protection center, where Lucy received medical attention. Thankfully, according to Malafeev, she only sustained bruises and hematomas. So it’s not clear why the dogs stayed on the tracks.The animal protection center returned the dogs to their owners after tracking them down. In a recent Facebook update, Malafeev noted that not all people would do what Panda did for Lucy.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[THE FRIENDLY SKIES  Anyone who’s been flying the friendly skies this past year has probably noticed that the passenger cabin has been looking more and more like a zoo with the sudden proliferation of service dogs and emotional support animals.

Service animal vests or tags can now be easily purchased online for varying prices, the Detroit Free Press reported.    And with cases of emotional support animals, all a passenger has to do is show a letter from a mental health professional saying that they need the animal for air travel.

      <title>Chelsea Manning to be released early after Obama commutes prison sentence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LEAVENWORTH, KANSAS  Just days before the end of his administration, U.S. President Barack Obama surprisingly granted clemency to one of America’s most controversial whistleblowers.The New York Times reports that in late 2009, Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, was deployed to Iraq by the U.S. Army. As an intelligence analyst, the Army private was allowed access to classified computer networks.Manning copied more than 700,000 documents, videos, war logs and diplomatic cables, in one of the biggest breaches of classified material in American history.The files were sent to WikiLeaks and made public, exposing everything from abuses of detainees to sensitive diplomatic deals and conversations. Among the items leaked was a video showing a U.S. helicopter attack on suspected insurgents in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists.Manning was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act and leaking government information. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison.The 29-year-old had been struggling with gender dysphoria while in the Army. After her sentencing, she came out as transgender and changed her name to Chelsea.She struggled with her mental health in prison and twice attempted suicide while incarcerated in Fort Leavenworth.On Jan. 17, President Obama commuted her sentence from 35 to seven years. She will be released on May 17, 2017.Manning’s road to freedom is in stark contrast to fellow leaker Edward Snowden, who is wanted on similar charges. Snowden also applied for a commuted sentence.White House officials say the two cases are different because Manning acknowledging her wrongdoing and went through the military criminal justice process. Snowden, however, fled to Russia, an adversary that has most recently been implicated in efforts to tamper with the U.S. presidential election.]]></description>

      <title>Jogger plays dead to survive vicious kangaroo attack in Melbourne</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TEMPLESTOWE, AUSTRALIA  A personal trainer in Melbourne had to have emergency surgery after being brutally mauled by a large male kangaroo.The Manningham Leader reports that Debbie Urquhart was jogging through a bush track in Templestowe Saturday morning and didn’t see the towering threat that was coming her way.A fully grown 2-meter-tall male kangaroo suddenly jumped at her and knocked her down. It kicked and clawed at her ferociously, shredding her clothes and ripping through her flesh.The 54-year-old played dead to try and get the roo to stop attacking, and soon the big boy backed off.Urquhart got back up and walked half a kilometer back home while bleeding from her injuries. She was rushed to the hospital by husband Robert and ended up getting more than 35 stitches.A kangaroo expert told the ABC that this particular kangaroo’s show of aggression was rare, as unprovoked attacks rarely occur. And while the harrowing encounter hasn’t slowed Urquhart down, she says she probably won’t be going near the tracks anytime soon.]]></description>

      <title>Swedish ambulances alert drivers to get out of the way via FM radio signals</title>
      <description><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM  Accidents involving ambulances and modern vehicles so well-insulated against noise that drivers can’t hear emergency sirens until it’s too late are on the rise in Sweden.In response, ambulances in Stockholm are testing a new emergency warning system that emits an FM radio signal, according to developers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.The radio signal is picked up by vehicles with a Radio Data System. Drivers’ own stereo systems then alert them to slow down and make space for an approaching ambulance.The system interrupts all audio playback inside vehicles with a voice announcement about the presence of an ambulance nearby. The announcement is accompanied by a text message on the stereo tuner’s display.The system reaches two-thirds of vehicles on Swedish roads, and can also warn of accidents ahead, according to the developers.The developers said the system will enhance accessibility for first responders and improve road safety.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[HIGHLANDS RANCH, COLORADO   Maserati car salesman Brandon Guy Gianopoulos was killed in a suspected high-speed car crash after a video of him joyriding was streamed live to his Facebook account.Gianopoulos worked at Mike Ward Maserati and had access to a slew of high-end Maserati vehicles, reported the Denver Post, citing local law enforcement. On Friday night he took one of the dealership’s vehicles for a spin. That same night, a soundless video was streamed on Facebook Live to Gianopolous’s account.

      <title>Nigerian fighter jet mistakenly bombs refugee camp, killing at least 52 civilians</title>
      <description><![CDATA[RANN, NIGERIA  The Nigerian Air Force killed at least 52 civilians and aid workers, and injured 120 more in an airstrike that was supposed to be targeting Boko Haram on Tuesday.The incident took place at a refugee camp located in the city of Rann, in the far north of Borno state of Nigeria at about 9 a.m. Humanitarian groups Doctors Without Borders and International Committee of the Red Cross were operating at the camp when it was bombed.“In recent weeks Boko Haram has moved base to Kala from Sambisa Forest and obviously a military jet mistook Rann for Kala and bombarded, killing many civilians," Rann resident Abba Abiso told AFP. The Nigerian army said the air force had been given coordinates of the Kala Balge area, a district including Rann, and a fighter jet had apparently targeted Rann instead of nearby Kala city.Doctors Without Borders said it had counted 52 dead and 120 wounded. The International Committee of the Red Cross said 6 Nigerian Red Cross members were killed and 13 were wounded.The Nigerian president said in a statement that the airstrike was a “regrettable operational mistake.” The army was unable to provide an official death toll, but one senior commander described the casualties from the attack as “huge,” AFP reported.]]></description>

      <title>This is what happens when a volcano spits out a pyroclastic flow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PLANET EARTH  The most explosive volcanic eruptions spit out a fast-moving and incredibly destructive mass of material known as a pyroclastic flow.Should you ever find yourself in the path of one, you should run in the opposite direction as quickly as possible, according to the United States Geological Survey.Pyroclastic flows are made up of a basal flow of volcanic ash, lava, rock and gases, which move beneath a cloud of ash. Their temperatures can exceed 1,000 degrees Celsius, and they can move at 700 kilometers per hour.Typically, pyroclastic flows move downslope but they can go uphill when the ratio of gas to ash is higher, according to Forbes. This is known as a pyroclastic surge.These dense pyroclastic surges can even move over water.Pyroclastic flows generally destroy everything in their path including vegetation, buildings and people.There are generally two kinds of pyroclastic flow. The first type forms when an eruption column cools and the ash becomes too dense to maintain an upward thrust.The second type is rarer and occurs when so much pressure builds up inside a volcano that it erupts laterally and boils over.The last known example of this is when Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted in 1980.]]></description>

      <title>Black man eating with white girlfriend harassed for not dating a black woman</title>
      <description><![CDATA[USA  A video of a biracial couple eating at a restaurant has gone viral, as it was filmed by a man who walked up to them and chastised the black man for being with a white woman.Not much is known about the couple, but the man recording mentions them being in a black restaurant. As the couple enjoyed a nice meal, another patron of the establishment took exception to their being together. So, he decided to “interview” them using his smart phone. Once the rude man interrupted their date, he just kept on going, chastising the poor guy for dating a white woman, whom he called “the lowest rung of humanity.”Somehow, the black boyfriend showed restraint and simply just laughed the rude customer off, doing his best to calmly de-escalate the situation. The video has since been posted to World Star, where it’s been viewed more than 800,000 times.]]></description>

      <title>Connecticut councilman arrested for literally grabbing worker by the p*ssy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT  A councilman in Greenwich, Connecticut was arrested last week for sexually assaulting a female public employee on Dec. 8.According to the arrest warrant cited by the Greenwich Daily Voice, Christopher von Keyserling, 71, and the unnamed 57-year-old woman were talking about politics. He reportedly told her: “I love this new world, I no longer have to be politically correct,” and called her a “lazy, bloodsucking union employee.”She claims she responded by saying, “(explicative deleted) you” before walking into her office. When she tried to leave, he allegedly reached from behind and pinched her groin. The employee said she threatened to punch him if he ever did it again, but he allegedly responded with an “evil look” and said nobody would believe her because it would be her word against his.The woman claims she reported him to HR but originally not want to press charges because she feared retribution. She later changed her mind after learning he had committed similar acts in the past.Von Keyserling said the whole thing was “just a joke.” He expressed surprise that the woman took offense, because he thought they had the kind of relationship that allowed him to joke around like that, Greenwich Daily Voice reported. But the police thought otherwise. Von Keyserling was arrested last Wednesday and charged with fourth-degree sexual assault.He posted $2,500 bond and is due to appear in court on Jan. 25.]]></description>

      <title>Leaked emails show Hillary Clinton wanted to ditch Taiwan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  An alleged email by Hillary Clinton shows that the former secretary of state was willing to discuss an op-ed piece in the New York Times that called for Washington to ditch Taiwan in exchange for China writing off U.S. debt. According to the document released by WikiLeaks, back in 2011, Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan sent the New York Times editorial titled “To Save Our Economy, Ditch Taiwan” by Paul V. Kane to Hillary. Clinton replied, “I saw it and thought it was so clever. Let’s discuss.”  Kane suggested the U.S. negotiate to have China write off $1.14 trillion in American debt in exchange for ending U.S. military assistance and arms sales to Taiwan. In Kane’s opinion this would cut American debt, help the economy and keep the U.S. and China from going to war over Taiwan.  It’s clear from reading Kane’s piece that he is clueless about Taiwan, as well as how China’s economy would be affected by such a massive write off.The WikiLeaks emails did not show whether Clinton actually discussed the article.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[PLAYA DEL CARMEN, MEXICO  An attack at 10-day electronic music festival in Mexico killed at least five people when a gunman opened fire outside a popular nightclub just south of Cancun. On January 16 at around 2:30am, shooting erupted at the annual BPM music festival when a man armed with a gun tried to enter the Blue Parrot nightclub in Playa del Carmen. At that moment, gunshots were fired in the immediate vicinity, as the lone gunman reportedly exchanged fire with someone inside the venue. The music festival’s staff intervened to protect club-goers, and they themselves were caught in the crossfire.

Video of the incident captured during the frightening scramble depicts the horror. Among the five confirmed dead by officials are two Canadians, an Italian, and a Colombian, with at least 15 more injured.

      <description><![CDATA[AUSTRALIA  Despite its whaling program having been ruled illegal by the International Court of Justice in 2014, Japan continues to antagonize the global community with its despicable practices. On Jan. 15, conservation Organization Sea Shepherd posted these disturbing photographs of a dead minke whale aboard the Nisshin Maru, the primary vessel of Japan’s whaling fleet. As the Japanese fleet traveled through the Australian Whale Sanctuary in the Southern Ocean, the ships must have caught sight of the whale and killed it. They weren’t as covert as they needed to be, because a Sea Shepherd helicopter spotted the whale’s carcass lying on the flensing deck of the Nisshin Maru.Realizing they were exposed, the crew of the whaler factory ship tried to cover their tracks, spreading a blue tarp over the body of the dead whale. The fleet’s harpoon ships then quickly followed suit, covering their deadly weapons.The discovery of the unlawful whaling comes just a day after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney. This is the first dead whale seen aboard a Japanese ship since the country was ordered to end its Antarctic hunt, when the International Court of Justice concluded that the scientific research being conducted was]]></description>

      <title>Chinese company Tencent faces backlash for simulated oral sex game at party</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SHENZHEN, CHINA  Chinese company Tencent is facing a major PR crisis after video of a sexually suggestive game being played by employees was posted online on Jan. 12. The footage was shot at an annual party hosted by Tencent's instant messaging application department. Two female employees were brought on stage and asked to drop to their knees in front of other male employees, whom were each holding closed water bottles between their legs. Spectators can be heard off camera cheering the girls on while they tried to unscrew the bottle caps with their mouths, reported by China’s Sina news. The video has sparked widespread public backlash, with commenters expressing their shock and disgust at the blatant sexism displayed through the game.Tencent later released a statement apologizing for the incident, adding that employees responsible for the game have been given “demerits” on their employee records. However, it isn’t clear whether this will result in any actual punishment.]]></description>

      <title>Aussie TV host blasts co-host over white outfit in leaked off-air #jacketgate video</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SYDNEY  Two news presenters for Australia’s Nine News got into a tense wardrobe stand-off after one forced the other to cover up.The exchange happened off-air, but was leaked online on Mumbrella, and is now being dubbed jacketgate.The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the now-infamous clip stars Amber Sherlock, who was in between segments with a guest and a fellow reporter when she noticed all three of them were all wearing white outfits.Annoyed, Sherlock began berating reporter Julie Snook for not wearing a jacket despite being told to do so two hours earlier, dismissing her excuses that she was busy and just flat-out forgot.Guest psychologist Sandy Rea tried to diffuse the situation by suggesting she’d cover up with a jacket instead, but Sherlock was adamant that Snook cover up.Eventually, someone did manage to find a black jacket to put on Snook. The trio was soon all smiles as the cameras rolled, with hardly any sign of the passive-aggressive drama that had been front and center just moments before.]]></description>

      <title>Ambulance drone bypasses traffic on the street to get patients help faster</title>
      <description><![CDATA[AUSTIN, TEXAS  A Texas-based design firm has illustrated plans for an ambulance drone that can help transporting patients faster and more efficiently than regular ambulances or helicopters.The concept of ambulance drone was submitted by argodesign to Co.Design’s Body Week, which features innovative technologies mainly concerning health and related subjects.The ambulance drone is modelled after a standard quadcopter, which is roughly the size of a compact car. The drone can follow a GPS location, be remotely controlled by a pilot, or a combination of both. It can travel on autopilot, while a pilot can control the drone remotely in case of difficult takeoffs and landings. One single pilot can also control a whole fleet of ambulance drones remotely.The drone is able to travel above traffic or other obstacles on the ground, so that it can arrive at its location faster than regular ambulances. Given its relatively small size, the drone could land almost anywhere."I wouldn’t be surprised to get emails, to hear lots of the aeronautics companies saying, ‘we are working on something like this,’" Mark Rolston, the founder of argodesign told Co.Design. "It makes perfect sense. We may have underestimated the wingspan challenge for lift, but in a greater scheme of things, that’s a trivial part of the idea."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[FREDERICK, MARYLAND  A social media manager for a Maryland school district was recently fired for being sassy on Twitter  the victim of higher-ups with sticks up their you-know-wheres.The Frederick News Post reports that the incident began after a student sent a tweet to Frederick County Public Schools account, asking for school to be cancelled the next day, but misspelling the word tomorrow as ‘tammarow’.Katie Nash, who manages the school’s Twitter account, replied in jest, asking how the student would learn how to spell the word correctly if school closed.The spectacular burn lit up the Twitterverse, with netizens very amused by the quip.The student didn’t take it personally, and even continued with the harmless banter. Unfortunately, the uptight members of the school board did. They called Nash to a meeting and promptly fired her for what they deemed to be inappropriate tweets.The firing led to a social media uproar, with Twitter users coming to Nash’s defense, and students clamoring to get her back.Nash admitted that she didn’t think she was going to be fired, instead expecting the school to give her counseling or suggestions on how to do her job. Still, she claims she she understands where the school is coming from.]]></description>

      <title>Black PhD student tackled to ground by cops, suspected of stealing HIS OWN car</title>
      <description><![CDATA[EVANSTON, ILLINOIS  Police have released dashcam footage that shows a black PhD student being arrested on suspicion of stealing his own car.The incident took place on Oct. 10, 2015,  when driver Lawrence Crosby was 25 years old and studying for a doctoral degree in civil engineering at Northwestern University.Earlier that night, Crosby aroused the suspicions of a member of the public, who saw him trying to fix some loose molding on his car roof with something that looked like a metal bar, the Chicago Tribune reported.The woman called 911, said she felt bad about racial profiling, but reported a potential case of grand theft auto anyway. She then jumped in her own car and started following Crosby.The student noticed he was being tailed and decided he would drive to the police station to explain the situation before things escalated.But by that point, the cops were already in hot pursuit.During the arrest, Crosby was kneed and struck with open hands as he was swarmed by officers and wrestled to the ground. Crosby proved to the cops that the car was his and explained he’d been trying to fix something on the roof. So when they couldn’t pin anything on him for theft, the police charged Crosby with resisting arrest and disobeying officers.Those charges were thrown out by a judge in March last year. Crosby has filed a civil lawsuit against the city and the arresting officers, alleging false arrest and excessive force.The police however, claim the use of force was justified.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[EADS, TENNESSEE  A Tennessee high schooler has raised thousands of dollars online to pay for her college tuition after claiming that her parents took away her college funds because she is dating a black guy.According to Allie Dowdle’s Gofundme page, she started dating her boyfriend Michael about a year ago. When the Eads, Tennessee student first shared this news to her parents, they did not approve.“My dad did not give me an option:  he told me that I was not allowed to see Michael ever again. Why? Strictly because of skin color.  It wasn't a quiet "no," either. I'll never forget the yelling my parents did, when they expressed how disappointed they were in me, that I could do so much better,” Allie writes on the fundraising site.Allie reported ignored her parents and continued to see Michael secretely. She wrote that she and Michael approached her parents last month, but was again met with fierce opposition. Eventually, their relationship cost her her phone, car and college funds.The goal on Allie’s Gofundme page was set at $10,000, but she received over $24,000 from almost a thousand people in just two days.Do you believe Allie’s claim that her parents simply didn’t want her dating a black guy?

      <title>Video shows terrified dog chained to roof of speeding SUV trailer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[FLAGLER COUNTY, FLORIDA  A videoclip of a dog riding on top of a trailer, as its being pulled by an SUV on the highway, is going viral online, and has animal lovers outraged.On January 11, Brenna Cronin was in a car travelling down the I-95, when she spotted the dog up ahead. The dog was chained to the roof of a trailer being pulled by an SUV going at speeds of over 70 mph. Cronin says as she passed, she noticed the letter “S” branded into the dog’s back right leg. Disgusted, Cronin pulled out her phone, and recorded a clip of the sad scene, which she uploaded to Facebook. She then called the police, and offered the cops a description of the vehicle, and the pet in peril. The next day, Cronin received a photograph from another Facebook user who’d caught sight of what appears to be the same dog, in the exact same predicament.Once the video surfaced, the owner was reached for comment by media. He claims he did nothing wrong, and went as far as to say the dog prefers riding on top of the cage, rather than inside with his other dogs. Animal control from two nearby counties went over the owner’s home to do a wellness check on the animals. In some counties in the area, animals must be transported in secure pet carriers or cages. Violators of this could be subject to a $93 fine, depending on which county the infraction took place.]]></description>

      <title>Florida man sexually abused pit bull for more than three years</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PENSACOLA, FLORIDA  A Florida man was arrested for having sex with his family’s pit bull for years before a roommate finally told the authorities. Bradley Hubbard, 23, moved in with his dad and his dad’s girlfriend in Pensacola three years ago. The family had a pit bull named “Baby Girl.” A family member who lived in the home says she saw Hubbard bringing Baby Girl back to his room. She says she could see the action through a hole in the door. At first she would hear the pit bull whimper and cry out. When asked what was going on, Hubbard would say the dog was in heat. Eventually the dog stopped making noises  probably because she was traumatized, Pensacola News Journal reported. On Dec. 28, Hubbard took the dog from the woman’s room and locked his door. The woman heard noises and “could not take it anymore,” so she called the cops. Hubbard’s father denied that his son was involved in any wrongdoing. But the person who reported the incident said the father had covered for his son before. A local veterinarian examined the dog for signs of rape and found that the dog’s genitals showed signs of sexual abuse. Hubbard is being held at the Escambia County Jail on a $15,000 bond. He faces charges of engaging in sexual conduct with an animal and causing death, pain or suffering to an animal. He is set to appear in court on Feb. 2.There was no word on why the roommate waited so long to report the abuse.]]></description>

      <title>Where did the Trump Russia dossier really come from?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  By now, you’ve all had a chance to read the 35-page Trump Russia dossier, if not, you should. Trump blasted the report as nothing but lies, similar to Nazi propaganda. He also described it by his new catchphrase  ‘fake news’  spread by sick people.  But then why did U.S. intelligence agencies brief President Obama and Trump? During the presidential race, ex-British spy Christopher Steele was hired by Republicans opposed to Trump’s candidacy, and then Democrats, to dig up dirt on Trump.         Steele probably did not have direct contact with the unnamed Kremlin officials who reportedly gave sensitive information on Trump. He most likely subcontracted some of the operation to trusted intermediaries in Moscow, who then reported back to him.     The report was passed onto John McCain, who gave it to the FBI. And thanks to Buzzfeed, we now all have access to it. Is intelligence evidence? No, it’s not. Could the information gathered in the report be wrong? Definitely. Is this all fake news? No, it’s not.]]></description>

      <title>Where did the Trump Russia dossier really come from?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  By now, you’ve all had a chance to read the 35-page Trump Russia dossier, if not, you should. Trump blasted the report as nothing but lies, similar to Nazi propaganda. He also described it by his new catchphrase  ‘fake news’  spread by sick people.  But then why did U.S. intelligence agencies brief President Obama and Trump? During the presidential race, ex-British spy Christopher Steele was hired by Republicans opposed to Trump’s candidacy, and then Democrats, to dig up dirt on Trump.         Steele probably did not have direct contact with the unnamed Kremlin officials who reportedly gave sensitive information on Trump. He most likely subcontracted some of the operation to trusted intermediaries in Moscow, who then reported back to him.     The report was passed onto John McCain, who gave it to the FBI. And thanks to Buzzfeed, we now all have access to it. Is intelligence evidence? No, it’s not. Could the information gathered in the report be wrong? Definitely. Is this all fake news? No, it’s not.]]></description>

      <title>Oklahoma man forced to pay child support for baby he found out isn&#x2019;t his</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TULSA, OKLAHOMA  An Oklahoma man in is getting a raw deal after finding out the child he’s fathered for three years isn’t his. The victim of an unusual state law, the man is also forced to make child support payments.When Thomas’ high school girlfriend told him she was pregnant, he wanted to do right by her, and so the two got married. Five months later, Thomas’ wife gave birth to a baby boy, but the two couldn’t make things work and eventually split. Having suspicions about whether his son was actually his, Thomas decided to take a paternity test – the test came back 0.00%. Shocked at how he could be so misled, he took his case to the courtroom. When a judge ordered that Thomas take another paternity test, the results came back the same. Initially, the courts deemed he was not financially responsible for the child, but the judge later reversed the decision. Under Oklahoma law, paternity must be tested before the child’s second birthday. After that, the presumed father becomes the legal father, and DNA tests are no longer of consequence.Now, Thomas finds himself paying the baby’s mama $500 a month in child support, as well as an additional $15,000 in back support, with interest.]]></description>

      <title>8-ton whale slaughtered outside Chinese office building</title>
      <description><![CDATA[XINYU, CHINA  A huge whale was butchered right outside an office building in China for God knows what reason, and now the stomach-churning video is making rounds on Chinese social media.The Global Times reports that the giant animal was a gift to the director of Risun Solar Energy Technology Corporation in Xinyu, Jiangxi province. It had to be hauled from the coast of Zhejiang to Jiangxi province for nearly $600.It was offloaded right beside the office canteen and prepped for slaughter by workers. In the video, a chef is seen standing in front of the enormous whale while sharpening his knives. Two workers were also captured using a saw to cut the mammal’s tail part.The foul stench attracted the attention of locals, who quickly began filming the 8-ton carcass being horrifically cut up.Authorities claim the meat was going to be used to feed dogs, but earlier reports and conversation in the video indicate that it was going to be given out to employees as a year-end bonus.  The Jiangxi Bureau of Fishery Administration started looking into the incident after the video was posted online on Friday. Apart from two particular species, it’s technically not illegal to transport and use whales, which are second-class nationally protected animals in China. What’s unclear though, is whether the company had the required permits and licenses to do so.]]></description>

      <title>Illiterate Steve Harvey doesn&#x2019;t think anyone would like Asian men</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  When Steve Harvey isn’t learning how to read, he apparently hosts a daytime talk show called the Steve Harvey Show. Last week, Harvey started his show by making fun of some self-help books. One of them was sadly called How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide for Asian Men. Just reading the title caused Harvey to break down in laughter. Harvey then asks his audience, “Excuse me, do you like Asian men?” He answers for them, “No. Thank You.”Then he launched into this bit, “How to Date a Black Woman: A Practical Guide to Asian Men. Same thing. ‘You like Asian men?’ I don’t even like Chinese food. It don’t stay with you no time … I don’t eat what I can’t pronounce.”Interesting that Harvey is joking about pronunciation, considering his moronic Miss Universe debacle last year. In his defense, the words ‘Colombia’ and ‘Philippines’ look practically identical.     Hopefully Harvey will get a nice warm welcome when he heads comes to Asia in two weeks to host the Miss Universe pageant in the Philippines. Maybe he should try out his Asian men jokes again.]]></description>

      <title>Huge tarantula caught on camera eating wild snake for snake for the first time ever</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SERRA DO CAVERÁ, BRAZIL  In October of 2015, a group of researchers conducting work on tarantula diversity stumbled upon a Grammostola quirogai tarantula, feasting on the body of an Almaden ground snake. The team photographed the spine-tingling spectacle and published a report of their findings in the December issue of the journal Herpetology Notes. What happened leading up to the meal is unknown, but the researchers suspect the snake may have slithered past the arachnid’s cozy dark den with plans of calling it home. Little did the 15-inch snake realize, the space already had a tenant. The tarantula was quick to give him notice. Her fangs, which measure almost an inch, would have plunged into the snake, liquefying its insides. Once decomposed, the tarantula then enjoyed its dinner.The incident is believed to be the first known account of of a wild tarantula eating a snake in the wild. The researchers report that previous incidents of tarantulas eating snakes have only been witnessed in controlled settings, where the snake would be introduced to the spider.]]></description>

      <title>Good Samaritan fatally shoots man who ambushed Arizona state trooper</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TONOPAH, ARIZONA  An Arizona state trooper responding to a road accident was ambushed by a man on early Thursday. The man was then shot dead by a good samaritan driving by.According to KPHO, Arizona state trooper Edward Andersson responded to a car accident on I-10 at about 4:30 a.m. and he saw an injured woman who was ejected from a rollover vehicle.Andersson immediately started putting out road flares to block the lanes when a suspect ambushed him. The suspect opened fire at Andersson and fought him to the ground. A passerby saw the fight and stopped to help the trooper. He retrieved a gun from his car and fatally shot the suspect."I don't know that my trooper would be alive today without his assistance," Department of Public Safety Col. Frank Milstead told KPHO.Authorities said initial indications are the suspect who shot the trooper might have been involved in the initial car crash.

      <title>Marijuana relieves chronic pain, but can cause schizophrenia and heart attacks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A landmark report reviewing more than 10,000 scientific studies of marijuana since 1999 has concluded that weed has some medical benefits, but also comes with plenty of health risks.The report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to provide conclusive evidence about the effects of marijuana  something that’s not very easy to come by, according to scientists.Researchers said there is conclusive or substantial evidence that chronic pain, along with nausea caused by chemotherapy, can be relieved by marijuana, according to their report.However, the report warns that using the drug may increase the risk of developing mental health problems, such as schizophrenia.The report says there is evidence that smoking marijuana can trigger heart attacks in patients already diagnosed with heart disease.The report links early marijuana use with substance abuse later in life. It also says using the drug increases the chances of respiratory problems, vehicle accidents, and low birth weight in babies born to mothers who smoke it.Around 22 million Americans used marijuana in the past month, according to a recent survey cited by NPR  despite the fact the federal government considers it a crime.Pot is legal for medical use in more than half of the U.S. states, with eight states allowing citizens to blaze it up just for kicks. The scientists said that a whole lot more research on the drug is required, which would be a lot easier if the federal government removed its regulatory red tape.Seems to us like the more scientific evidence, the better, so that people can make informed choices about the substances they put into their own bodies.]]></description>

McKenzie has since taken out an apprehended violence order against her.The 2011 Miss Virginia USA was already making headlines before she moved to Australia in 2014  but for all the wrong reasons.Her then-roommate accused her of smashing furniture and uttering gay slurs at him and his friends.

      <title>World&#x2019;s largest peatland with vast carbon sink discovered in the Congo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CENTRAL CONGO BASIN  Scientists have recently discovered the world’s largest tropical peatland, which spans between the two Congos.The newly discovered Cuvette Centrale peatland lies in the central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometers, which is an area larger than England. The peatland locks in 30 billion tonnes of carbon, which is the equivalent of three years of the world’s total fossil fuel emissions.Peat is an organic wetland soil formed after dead plant debris. Peatlands act as carbon sinks by removing carbon from the atmosphere through plant growth. If peatlands dry out, such as through drainage for agriculture, it could trigger further decomposition of the peat, thus releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."Peatlands are only a resource in the fight against climate change when left intact, and so maintaining large stores of carbon in undisturbed peatlands should be a priority," Simon Lewis Leeds University ecologist and one of the authors of the study on Cuvette Centrale peatland told Reuters.]]></description>

      <title>Super suit designed with military tech to give grandma and grandpa more strength</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA  A California-based startup has designed a powered suit that can provide extra muscle strength for elderly people and increase their mobility.Superflex’s Aura Powered suit is a smartsuit designed to be worn in direct contact with the body. It contains hexagonal pods that house batteries, control boards and elastic muscle technology.The technology was originally developed at robotics lab SRI International under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant to reduce injuries in soldiers carrying heavy loads. SRI patented a smart material that behaves like human muscle, which expands when exposed to an electric current and contracts when the current is removed.The Aura Powered suit is configured to be aligned with the body’s natural muscular movements, and provides extra power by the mechanical motion of the smart material. Thus, it can provide support for the user when sitting down and add muscle power when getting up.The suit has a tentative release date of mid-2018.]]></description>

      <title>Burglars outwit guard dog with treats before ransacking suburban home</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PEORIA, ARIZONA  A couple of burglars were quick to take advantage of a guard dog who was distracted by a handful of treats.On December 8, the unidentified man and woman pulled up to the house in their Chevy Impala and parked in the driveway. After knocking and realizing no one was home, the man then hopped over the wall and proceeded to the dog door. He didn’t show up empty-handed, carrying some sort of food for the dog.Luring the unsuspecting canine out through the doggy door, the man squeezed his way into the small flap door and proceeded to ransack the home, stealing multiple goods with the greatest of ease.One by one, the thieves carried the furniture to the car, as the dog watched. When they finished packing up the loot into their car, the pooch watched them speed away, leaving him behind in the driveway. Luckily, a neighbour spotted the dog and returned him to his owners. Police are asking for the public’s help to track down the two criminals.]]></description>

      <title>An animated retelling of Boston&#x2019;s Great Molasses Flood of 1919</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BOSTON  It’s been referred to as the Great Molasses Flood, the day a tank filled with more than 2 million gallons of molasses burst, and swept through Boston’s city streets swallowing everything in its path. The exact reason for what caused the tank to blow has yet to be known, but cheap materials, faulty maintenance and weather conditions largely factored into the extent of the damage done. Reports indicate that on Jan. 15, 1919, the weather in Boston was a cool 41 degrees Fahrenheit, an unseasonably warm temperature for that time of year. The open hearth steel iron tank, stationed over at the city’s North End neighborhood, stood 50 feet tall and measured 90 feet in diameter.The tank had been filled 29 times before and had received 2.3 million gallons of molasses from Puerto Rico two day prior. Apparently, basic safety procedures weren’t adhered to. Having leaked many times in the past, the tank was painted brown to hide the leaks. A steep price for the neglect was paid when, on that fateful afternoon, rivets burst along the side of tank. Locals said it sounded like a machine gun firing. Suddenly, the top of the tank blew off, and its circular iron walls ripped apart, pulled in opposite directions. Twenty-six million pounds of warm molasses were unleashed upon the city, moving at a speed of roughly 35 miles per hour. Some reports at the time indicated a 40-foot wave of syrup oozed through the city, crushing buildings and overturning vehicles. The molasses was so powerful, it knocked an elevated rail off its tracks and hurled a truck into the Boston Harbor. Horses, dogs and humans were swept up and scattered through the city. The molasses waist-deep, their attempts to struggle and escape the sticky goo only proved to worsen their plight. The warmer temperature is believed to have caused the molasses to cool faster than it would have in the summer, impeding rescue efforts.The disaster claimed the lives of 21 people and left 150 badly injured. Nearly a century later, the exact cause of the tank’s failures remain unknown, but fermentation, hasty construction and thin, brittle steel walls have been suspected as reasons for its undoing.]]></description>

      <title>Hate crime charge for lady who hounded Mexican family on Facebook Live</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SEATTLE  A crazed white woman, aged 48, has been charged with a hate crime after following and abusing a Mexican family on Facebook Live.In November Seattle resident Sandra Jametski filmed herself ranting for 10 minutes while stalking the immigrant family as they were taking their kids to school. She road-rages about the un-American driving, how she’s surrounded by foreigners and calls out the family for what she dubs their “Spanish privilege.”At the most heated point in the exchange, she threatens to ram the family’s car off the road and get them deported, reported the Seattle Times. The worst part is she also ranted at them in front of the son’s school, all for the world to see. She claims one of their kids caused a car accident last year. According to the cops, that crash was Jametski’s fault.Seattle police charged Jametski with a hate crime and threw her in jail. Her bail was set at $500,000 dollars. If found guilty, Jametski could be looking at a prison sentence of up to five years, a $10,000 fine or both.]]></description>

      <title>Flashing the peace sign could lead to your identity being stolen</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TOKYO  It’s a fashionable way to strike a pose that apparently started in Asia and has gained popularity around the world.But now Japanese scientists are warning people their identities could be stolen simply by flashing the peace sign for a selfie.Researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Informatics say it is possible to steal someone’s fingerprints in a photo taken from up to 3 meters away, CNet reported, citing the Japanese-language Sankei Shimbun.All the potential hacker requires is a digital camera and the fingertips to be well-lit and in focus.The researchers say the peace sign makes is easy for hackers to match fingerprints to faces, posing a security threat to phones, laptops, bank accounts and buildings.They warn it is possible to steal fingerprints from peace sign gestures, waving, and people giving the thumbs up.The researchers have developed a titanium oxide-based coating that can be attached to fingers to hide their prints. The film protects fingerprints from theft but doesn’t stop them from working as security verification. However, it won’t be available commercially for another two years.]]></description>

      <title>Missing 5-year-old&#x2019;s body found hidden inside family&#x2019;s Chinese restaurant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NORTH CANTON, OHIO  A couple of thought-to-be concerned parents in North Canton, Ohio, who reported their 5-year-old daughter missing have turned out to be more concerned with saving their own hides, after police found Ashley Zhao’s body hidden in the family’s Chinese restaurant a day later. The mother, MingMing Chen, 29, has admitted to police that on the morning of Jan. 9, she beat the girl with her fist, repeatedly. The child’s father, Liang Zhao, 34, then came over to tend to Ashley, and noticed a green fluid dripping out of her mouth. He also noticed she’d stopped breathing. He attempted to revive her by performing CPR, but was unsuccessful. That evening, the couple reported Ashley missing, saying she’d gone to the back of the restaurant for a nap, but somehow vanished. When investigators searched for her in the area, it didn’t take long for them to find her body “concealed” in the restaurant, near the freezer.The mother has been charged with murder and felonious assault, and the father with complicity to commit felonious assault and complicity to commit murder. The restaurant, Ang’s Asian Cuisine, is now permanently closed, and has become a makeshift memorial for little Ashley Zhao. Regular customers say she was a very sweet and social child.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[HARBOR SPRINGS, MICHIGAN  The year 2017 started out horribly for one Michigan man, who spent New Year’s Day injured and helpless in the snow. Luckily, it was man’s best friend to the rescue.The Petoskey News Review reports that around 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 31, Bob (the newspaper did not publish his name citing “privacy reasons.”) ran out in his slippers and pajamas to get another log for his fire. Halfway there, he slipped and fell on the ice, breaking his neck, which rendered him paralyzed.Unable to move, he screamed for help. But with the nearest neighbor a quarter mile away, it was his 5-year-old golden retriever Kelsey that ran to his side.The temperature dipped to freezing, but Kelsey stayed by Bob, barking for help and licking his face and hands to keep him warm.The 64-year-old lost consciousness, but Kelsey’s howling eventually got the attention of a neighbor, who finally discovered Bob 20 hours later.He was rushed to the hospital, where a doctor performed emergency surgery to save him. Miraculously, he didn’t have frostbite, and is recovering nicely  a feat he claims he owes to two heroes: his dog, and his doctor.]]></description>

      <title>Massive python suffocates alligator in deadly underwater wrestling match</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BIG CYPRESS, FLORIDA  A journalist riding his bike near near the everglades witnessed an unnatural sight that has been becoming increasingly more common  a Burmese python drowning an alligator.On the morning of Dec. 21, while cycling, journalist Joe Capozzi heard some commotion coming from a swamp up ahead. He hopped off his bike to investigate and spotted a 6-foot alligator, belly up and fighting for its life, as a 15-foot python coiled itself around the gator’s body.Capozzi wasted no time, grabbing his smartphone to record the intense encounter. He recalls that while the gator would pop up from the water every few minutes, the snake had total control over it, tightening its grip and robbing it of air, until it finally stopped moving. Capozzi says the scene looked like an alligator trapped in a stack of tires underwater. After watching for roughly 10 minutes, a clear winner having emerged, Capozzi continued on his bike ride, and wrote about what he saw two weeks later in a piece for The Palm Beach Post. Burmese pythons have invaded Florida’s ecosystem over the past decade, a result of irresponsible exotic pet owners and the destruction of a python breeding facility in 1992 caused by Hurricane Andrew. More than 2,000 snakes have been removed from the area, but the snakes continue to breed at a rapid pace.]]></description>

      <title>Europe&#x2019;s first underwater art museum opens in Spain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LANZAROTE, SPAIN  A museum featuring more than 300 sculptures opened to the public this week  14 meters beneath the sea.The Museo Atlantico is located off the south coast of Lanzarote in Spain’s Canary Islands and is the first of its kind in Europe.The 2,500-square-meter site is best explored by scuba diving around it, but if you don’t want to strap on a wetsuit and oxygen tank, it can also be viewed through a glass-bottom boat.The permanent sculptures are the work of British artist Jason Taylor, the Local reported.All the sculptures have been made with high-density pH-neutral concrete so they don’t damage the marine ecosystem. Taylor hopes to encourage marine life to prosper in the area, which is a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.Some of the works carry a political message, such as a piece depicting migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea. The artist said it was a tribute to migrants who succeeded but also those whose dreams and hopes remain at the bottom of the sea.Taylor spent the past two years living in Lanzarote, creating artworks for the museum, and started dropping sculptures onto the seabed about a year ago.He said he hoped the museum could foster a better understanding of the marine environment and how much we depend on it, according to the Telegraph.]]></description>

      <title>Taiwan scrambles fighter jets as China aircraft carrier enters Taiwan Strait</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAIPEI  Tension between China and Taiwan heightened after China’s aircraft carrier and its fleet of warships entered the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier and warships entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and was sailing along the west side of the median line of the strait after returning from exercises in the South China Sea. In response, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets and navy ships to monitor and control the situation. Taiwan’s defense department estimates the Liaoning will leave Taiwan Strait on Thursday.“I want to emphasize our government has sufficient capability to protect our national security. It's not necessary to overly panic,” Reuters quoted Chang Hsiao-yueh, minister for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council as saying. “On the other hand, any threats would not benefit cross-Strait ties.”In response, China claims the Liaoning’s movements complied with international law.“The Taiwan Strait is an international waterway shared between the mainland and Taiwan. So, it is normal for the Liaoning to go back and forth through the Taiwan Strait in the course of training, and it won't have any impact on cross-Strait relations,” Reuters quoted China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin’s comment at a briefing on Asia-Pacific security.]]></description>

      <title>Japanese macaque monkey caught on camera having sex with deer</title>
      <description><![CDATA[YAKUSHIMA, JAPAN  A monkey was caught on camera humping a deer in the woods of Yakushima Island in southwestern Japan. What’s more, it seems like the action was consensual. Japanese macaques are known to hitch rides on deer in the wild, but this was a different kind of ride. The video, recorded in November of 2015 by scientist Alexandre Bonnefoy, shows a macaque doinking a Sika deer, humping it 15 times in 10 seconds. Afterwards the deer was seen licking its butt.The monkey then went at it with a second deer, chasing away two bystanders so they could have some alone time together. Another monkey tried to get in on the action, but he was thrown from a deer’s back.According to a study by Bonnefoy and his colleagues, the strange behavior may be the result of “mate deprivation,” when monkeys who lack access to females of their own species are more likely to look for love elsewhere in the animal kingdom.]]></description>

The dossier from a former British spy claims Russia has been cultivating Donald Trump for the past five years. It claims Russia asked Trump for intel on oligarchs living in America. They also wanted Trump to play down Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine, which Trump can do once he becomes president next week.In exchange, they would help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton via Wikileaks.Russian intelligence also promised not to use the ‘kompromat’ they compiled on Trump.

      <title>Alzheimer&#x2019;s drug could regrow teeth without the need for fillings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LONDON  A team of British university researchers may soon eradicate the need for dentist fillings.Dentists traditionally use fillings to repair tooth decay and holes in teeth, but these are often permanent, meaning the tooth’s protective minerals never fully regenerate. According to a news release posted on the King’s College London website, scientists from the university have found that Tideglusib, a drug traditionally used to treat Alzheimer’s, can help teeth repair themselves. During testing, biodegradable collagen sponges were given a protective coating and soaked with the drug before being inserted into moles in mice’s teeth, reported the BBC.When the sponge began breaking down, researchers discovered that teeth were able to naturally heal themselves.The team plans to carry out the next phase of testing on rats, reported the Guardian. If that’s successful, they will then apply to experiment on human patients in clinical trials.]]></description>

      <title>Uber driver streams bomb-carrying passenger&#x2019;s bank robbery on Facebook</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MIAMI  You’d think the bizarre string of events that unfolded in Miami on Tuesday was from a movie, but nope, it’s all real.The drama began when a bomb-carrying man in a suit, later identified as 35-year-old Enrique Antonio Gamez, took his Uber driver hostage, reports the Miami Herald. The driver, known on Facebook as Mikebilly So-Focused, livestreamed his kidnapper as the latter was robbing the Navy Federal Credit Union. In the video, Gamez can be seen calmly approaching a bank attendant, likely threatening her with the explosive device. The bank attendant goes up to a teller and soon hands the robber a pink envelope full of cash. Gamez tries to get the attendant to come with him as a hostage, assuring her he plans to surrender before then going on a rant about Russian hacking and World War III.Two more live streams are taken in the car, with the man continuing his long-winded rant against the government. The driver tries to get him to show the bomb, but the suspect instead flashes his loot.The pair eventually end up at Ocean Drive in Miami Beach, where the robber makes like Robin Hood and starts giving the cash to random passers-by.True to his word, Gamez then calls the cops, who eventually arrive and take both him and his Uber driver into custody.Sections of Ocean Drive had to be closed off, and a bomb squad called in to secure the premises. Gamez is now with the feds and facing charges, but the Uber the driver was eventually let go, according to NBC Miami.]]></description>

He then paid for his parking spot at a kiosk and walked toward the garage.Zafar was recorded on camera following Ashcraft to the garage. Ashcraft reportedly deliberately walked to a populated part of the garage, where he thought he had lost Zafar.

      <title>Seeds inside ammunition will sprout and grow plants after bullets are used</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON COUNTY, VIRGINIA  The United States Department of Defense is issuing a call to contractors to develop biodegradable bullets for military training exercises. The U.S. Army runs through thousands upon thousands of ammunition rounds every year. The bullets currently being used take hundreds of years to break down, while also corroding and polluting the planet’s soil and water sources. The DoD’s new proposal would see specialized seeds encased in the bullets, designed to grow plants that eliminate ammunition debris and contaminants. The seeds would begin to sprout long after landing in the ground, and would eventually become a source of food for animals, too. Through the Small Business Innovation Research agency, the Department of Defense is accepting applications until February 8. They are looking for ammunition designs for 40 to 120 mm training rounds that perform on the same level as bullets being used today. Applications will also need to include potential ways the technology provides benefits, in addition to defensive capabilities.]]></description>

      <title>Man robs a GUN STORE and is predictably shot dead by store owners</title>
      <description><![CDATA[MABLETON, GEORGIA  An armed robber was shot dead and his accomplice is on the run after a failed hold-up at a gun store in Georgia.Security camera footage of the fatal Dec. 26 incident was released this week.It shows gun store owner Jimmy Groover, 64, moving faster than green grass through a goose to defend his property and his life.Two unidentified armed men burst into the store in broad daylight, pointed their pistols, and threatened to kill the owner and his assistant if they didn’t get down on the floor, NBC affiliate WXIA reported.But they didn’t count on old Jimmy Groover being armed and ready.In the blink of an eye, the gun store owner fired at the first robber, shooting him dead. The other suspect skedaddled and he’s now wanted by the police.Groover said he felt bad about killing the guy but knew he had little choice after the robbers made threats to kill.Groover’s store has been robbed around 20 times over the years but this is the first time he’s ever shot one of the bandits.Detectives said it was unlikely the grandfather would be charged with any crime because he acted in self-defense.]]></description>

      <title>The presidential state car, Cadillac One, gets an upgrade for President-elect Donald Trump</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  When he becomes president of the United States, Donald Trump will travel in an upgraded version of the Cadillac-branded limousine used by current President Barack Obama.According to Autoweek, the new presidential state car is expected to sport the looks of a Cadillac Escalade sedan. Known as “Cadillac One” or by the Secret Service as “The Beast,” it will use a Kodiak medium-duty truck frame with custom-made body panels.More tank than car, its bodywork is made from hardened steel, aluminum, titanium and ceramics, with windows that can withstand armour-piercing bullets. The interior is completely sealed to shield the president from biochemical attacks. It has heavy armour-plated doors and a reinforced steel plate running underneath the vehicle that protects it from roadside bombs.The presidential limousine has tear gas cannons and a night vision camera installed in front as well as a pump-action shotgun. Extra weapons, an oxygen supply and bottles of the president’s blood type are also on board. The fuel tank is armor-plated and encased in foam to prevent it from exploding. The tires are puncture and shard-resistant with steel rims that allow the car to continue driving even if the tires are destroyed.The new and improved Beast will be revealed on Jan. 20 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States.]]></description>

      <title>Hyperloop One plans full test run within three months in Las Vegas</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS  Hyperloop One announced last week that it plans to execute a full test within the next three months at Apex Industrial Park in Las Vegas, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The test run will cover 500 linear meters, said Nick Earle, the company’s senior vice president of global field operations. “It will levitate, catch the right speed and slow down,” Earle said. “Then what we’ll do, is over the next few months extend that into a few kilometers,” he said. In May 2016, the company successfully tested its levitating electromagnetic motor on an open air sled, reaching speeds of 116 mph, according to Wired. Earle also told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the company is planning to have a full Hyperloop system ready to transport freight by 2020. The hyperloop is based on the idea by Elon Musk of levitating pods that would travel in near-vacuum tubes at speeds of over 700 mph, powered by an electric propulsion system, according to Wired. According to Musk’s calculations, a hyperloop trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles would take only 36 minutes, Wired reported.]]></description>

      <title>85-year-old hero with walking stick rescues two women from burning car</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BURLESON, TEXAS  An elderly man from Texas is being hailed a hero after he rescued two women from the wreckage of a burning vehicle.Lindell Marbut, 85, was minding his own business at home on Sunday, when a speeding car crashed into his driveway and burst into flames, Fox 4 reported.When Lindell’s caretaker Sondra Young ran next door to call 911, the senior citizen searched for the hero inside himself, then went into full-on Superman mode.Lindell usually relies on a cane to get around, but that didn’t stop him from single-handedly pulling the 22-year-old driver out of the car. The valiant senior then dragged a female passenger from the fiery deathtrap with Young’s help and got her safely out of harm’s way.Responding firefighters said things could have turned out a whole lot toastier for the two women if it wasn’t for Lindell’s heroic actions.Speed was a factor in the crash, according to the authorities. Both women sustained internal injuries but are expected to survive.Lindell played down his courageous good deed, and said he’d do it all again if he had to.]]></description>

      <title>German politician proposes government handouts to pay for prostitutes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY  A German politician wants the government to pay for the needy to have sex with prostitutes.The patient would need a doctor to approve the treatment and would claim the “sex prescription” as a medical expense to be reimburse by the local government, according to a proposal by Elisabeth Scharfenberg, care spokeswoman for the German Green Party.Scharfenberg told Germany’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that a similar policy is already in place in the Netherlands. The policy allows those with severe health issues to claim sex with prostitutes as a medical expense, Deutsche Welle reported. Scharfenberg said patients would need a medical certificate showing they can’t achieve sexual satisfaction in other ways. They would also have to prove they can’t afford to pay for sex.But some members of the Green Party worry that niche policy proposals like this one contribute to the perception that the party is not serious. Green parliamentarian and Tübingen mayor Boris Palmer attacked the proposal, saying “well intentioned” ideas like these cause the public to dismiss the Greens as “unworldly oddballs.”Prostitution is legal in Germany, where it does not carry the same stigma as in many other Western countries. Prostitutes in Germany can even visit nursing homes to service elderly residents.]]></description>

      <title>&#x2018;Tree man of Bangladesh&#x2019; gets hands back after 16 operations</title>
      <description><![CDATA[DHAKA, BANGLADESH  It may have taken a year and an insane number of surgeries, but this Bangladeshi man couldn’t be happier to finally have his hands and feet back.CNN reports that Abul Bajander suffers from epidermodysplasia verruciformis, a rare disease that began causing lesions to appear on his skin at age 10. The lesions worsened over time, eventually encompassing both his hands and making it difficult for him to make a living as a rickshaw driver.Bark-like growths had also started sprouting from his hands and feet, making it impossible to do anything except scratch his neck.The 27-year-old has been dubbed “Tree Man” by international media, and is one of only four people in the world to ever be diagnosed with the disease.Doctors in Dhaka offered to treat him free of charge, and moved him and his family to the hospital last February to begin the first of many groundbreaking surgeries.Sixteen operations later, doctors have removed eleven pounds of growth and restored tree man’s hands.He’ll still need a few more surgeries for beautification, but he now can at least eat, write, and hold his 3-year-old daughter on his own.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TAMPA, FLORIDA  Deshaun Watson and the Clemson Tigers stunned Alabama in the College Football Playoff National Championship game, winning 35-31 on Monday night.

Alabama and its tag team of Ryan Anderson and Reuben Foster pressured Watson all game long. But then Watson got hot along with Clemson’s receiving crew. Hunter Renfrow and Williams came up with big catch after big catch, and the Tigers went up 28-24.Jalen Hurts put it on the ground with a huge run, edging the Tide back on top 31-28.

      <title>Video of obese woman towed by  pickup truck is no laughing matter for Kansas City pastor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI  A Kansas City pastor felt the wrath of social media after posting a video of an obese woman in a wheelchair being towed by a pickup truck to Facebook.The video was shared more than 11,000 times over the weekend, but Pastor Lamond Rushing felt the heat after many failed to see the funny side.The whole saga began on Saturday when disabled woman Becky Kittrell’s power wheelchair ran out of battery on the freezing cold streets of Kansas City, Fox 4 reported.Luckily for Becky, a Good Samaritan in a pickup truck stopped and offered to tow her home.That’s where Pastor Rushing comes in. The flabbergasted man of God thought he was seeing a miracle and began filming on his cellphone.Becky doesn’t have Facebook but found out she was a viral sensation when her son saw the video and told her.Becky said that instead of filming her, the pastor could have asked if she needed any help.Temperatures dropped as low as 7 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas City that day and Becky just needed to find some shelter from the cold. After all, wouldn’t offering to help have been the Christian thing to do?Pastor Rushing said he never intended to hurt Becky’s feelings. The preacherman said he’d just never seen anything like it before.However, after reading some ungodly comments about Becky online, the pastor said he understood why people were so upset with him. He apologized for filming the video and later removed it from Facebook.]]></description>

      <title>Flying with firearms? Here&#x2019;s how to transport them in checked baggage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[PENTAGON CITY, VIRGINIA  The suspect who carried out a recent mass shooting at a Florida airport reportedly carried out the attack using a gun that was in his checked luggage.Although laws vary by local and state governments, TSA guidelines do allow passengers to travel with firearms if they are stored properly.Firearms must be unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container. Other firearm parts, including magazines and ammunition for small arms, can be placed in the same container. The key to the container should only be retained by the passenger. The container can be placed inside a suitcase but it can only transported as checked baggage.The passenger should check in at the airline counter and inform the airline representative about the firearm in his or her checked baggage. The representative will then have the passenger sign the weapon’s unloaded declaration slip.The baggage will then be examined by TSA agents, while the passenger should standby until the agent clears the baggage for transportation.Despite the fact that firearms are prohibited in carry-on bags, the TSA found 2,653 firearms in carry-on bags across the U.S. in 2015 alone, with more than 80 percent of those weapons being loaded.]]></description>

      <title>Axe-wielding woman goes on rampage in 7-Eleven, attacking two customers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SYDNEY  Police have arrested a woman after a vicious attack on two customers inside a 7-Eleven with an axe.On January 7, Evie Amati, 24, strolled into the convenience store, carrying an axe, as well as a knife in her back pocket. Meanwhile at the register, customer Sharon Hacker, 43,  was pulling money from her purse, with customer Ben Rimmer, 32, waiting behind her in line with a meat pie. When Amati walked over to Rimmer with the axe in hand, he reportedly thought she was kidding around. Seconds later when he turned away, Amati started swinging. After laying Rimmer out, blood gushing everywhere, Amati turned her attention to Sharon Hacker, and clubbed her in the back of the head with the axe. Her victims on the ground, Amati then casually walked out of the store. It wasn’t long before police caught up to her. Luckily, both customers survived the attack, though Ben Rimmer’s face had been opened up. A witness present said his blood was all over the store of the floor. He remains in hospital with serious head injuries. Sharon Hacker suffered a fractured skull, but she claims her thick dreadlocks may have prevented further injury. Evie Amati has been charged with wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.]]></description>

      <title>Salt and ice challenge leaves severe burn on UK schoolboy&#x2019;s hand</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SWANSEA, UNITED KINGDOM  A high school student in Wales took part in the internet craze known as the “salt and ice challenge,”  and a photograph of his damaged hand is making the rounds on social media.The salt and ice challenge involves placing salt somewhere on the body, and then using an ice cube to press down on the area for as long as possible. Doing this creates a burning sensation in the area, as the salt and the ice combined become significantly colder than the ice on its own, at -18°F (-28°C). Once the participant finally gives up, initially they may feel an immediate numbing sensation in the affected area, meaning they’ve likely experienced nerve damage resulting from second- or third-degree burns, similar to frostbite. The teen’s mother published the photograph of the skin burn to warn other parents of the dangers of this salt and ice challenge.]]></description>

      <title>Brown snake swallows carpet python in stunning rare footage</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA  Extremely rare footage of a brown snake eating a carpet python has been captured on film … where else, but Down Under?The incident was filmed on Jan. 2 at a suburban house near Brisbane in the state of Queensland. It shows a deadly brown snake taking several leisurely hours to devour his less-fortunate fellow serpent, presumably after a fight to the death. Brown snakes are the world’s second-most venomous land snake and are responsible for about half of all human deaths from snake bites in Australia. The non-poisonous carpet python … Mmm, well, not so much. The incredible scene was discovered by fearless snake-catching duo, Norman and Sally Hill and posted to their Facebook page.It might have taken three hours, but eventually the brown snake finished his meal and was then removed from the house.Usually brown snakes eat frogs, birds, rats and mice but according to the Australian Museum, the species is known to be cannibalistic in captivity and can prey on snakes of a similar size.Which just goes to show that in deadly Australia, even some of the biggest predators can sometimes become the prey.]]></description>

      <title>Look out below! Seagulls in Alaska carrying super-strain of E. coli</title>
      <description><![CDATA[KENAI PENINSULA, ALASKA  A team of scientists studying seagull feces at landfills in Anchorage have found a strain of E. coli bacteria that has proven to be resistant to antibiotics.In a study published in the journal Infection Ecology and Epidemiology last November, at researchers the U.S. Geological Survey explain in detail how the resilient strain of E. coli bacteria has strengthened to the point where human-developed medicines have no answer for it. When antibiotics are ingested, they pass through our bodies and get flushed down the toilet, into the sewage system. However, water treatment plants aren’t designed to treat antibiotic residues, allowing them to make their way into the environment. Bacteria in the environment then meet the antibiotic residues, and over time, they become resistant to them. Animals who hang out in places of high-human activity, like seagulls, then contract the E. coli.The researchers aren’t sure the E. coli found in the seagull fecal matter can be transmitted to humans, but they are certain that humans are the cause of these infections in the birds. In the United States, the CDC reports 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths are caused each year by drug-resistant bacteria.]]></description>

      <title>Five inmates injured at Chicago super-max jail fight</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO, ILLINOIS  Five inmates were injured during a massive fight at Illinois's Cook County Jail Friday around 1:30 p.m., in the jail's super-max division.The mayhem began when an inmate standing near the center of the room punched another in the back of the head. Another inmate was then struck, causing his head to bounce off a cement pillar. Out cold, he remained on the floor until someone pulled him away.Nearly 30 men in the general population room were present, but some clearly didn’t want to be involved and stayed close to the walls.  Guards eventually brought the situation under control with taser guns. Several weapons were recovered including two that appear to have been made from inhaler parts. Officials are investigating how the inmates got hold of weapons.Cara Smith, a spokeswoman for the jail, said five inmates were taken to hospital to be treated for their injuries, including stab wounds, but none of the injuries were life-threatening. Four of the five inmates were in jail on murder charges while the fifth person was charged with armed robbery.]]></description>

      <title>SeaWorld announces death of Tilikum, world&#x2019;s most famous orca whale</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ORLANDO  On January 6, the world’s most famous whale passed away.SeaWorld announced that Tilikum the orca whale has finally died due to complications from a bacterial lung infection he’d been fighting.Tilikum’s health had been in decline for a few months, but the suffering he endured lasted for more than three decades. In 1983, then 2-year-old Tilikum was captured off the coast of Iceland, ripped from his family and taken to a marine zoo. A year later, Tilikum was then transferred to Sealand of the Pacific, a former marine park in Canada’s British Columbia. Forced to learn tricks and perform for audiences regularly, it didn’t take long for Tilikum to become aggressive toward humans. In 1991, 20-year-old part-time trainer Keltie Byrne was working with Tilikum and two other whales when she slipped into the pool. As she struggled to get out of the pool, the whales reportedly prevented her from doing so. Tilikum supposedly carried the young girl’s dead body around on his back for the next two hours before staff were able to retrieve her. After Sealand of the Pacific closed down the next year, Tilikum was then transferred to Orlando, sold to SeaWorld for $1 million. There, too, he was kept in a small tank, built to hold only one-ten-thousandth of the water an orca would normally traverse over a day in the wild. Experts say these conditions can lead to psychosis for the whales, and it wasn’t long before Tilikum struck again. In 1999, a 27-year-old drifter named Daniel Dukes had somehow snuck into the park, and dove into a breeding tank with the whale. The next morning, Dukes’ body was found draped across Tilikum’s back, a familiar sight. His swimming trunks were found floating in the pool. The death was reported as a likely drowning, but that wouldn’t explain all the injuries Dukes suffered. His genitals had reportedly been bitten off.Tilikum’s murderous streak culminated in 2010, when SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was pulled down into the pool during a live performance. Brancheau’s death was the focus of the 2013 acclaimed documentary Blackfish, which exposed SeaWorld’s treatment of its orca whales and nearly sunk the company after an extreme public backlash. In response to the film, SeaWorld has since halted its captive breeding program, and announced it would be phasing out theatrical orca shows.In a statement last week, SeaWorld mourned the loss of Tilikum, and noted the “world-class care” provided to him, and that he “lived a long and enriching life while at SeaWorld.”]]></description>

      <title>Speared through the head, this unlucky man miraculously survived</title>
      <description><![CDATA[THE BAHAMAS  Alarming photographs are circulating on social media of a man reportedly speared through the head while on a diving excursion off the coast of the Bahamas.Not much is known about this incident just yet, not even the man’s name. Photos of the man in hospital, both before and after the spear-removal surgery, are inciting a collective gasp among users online. Though most would call this an unlucky situation, doctors would probably say he’s the luckiest man alive. Had the spear pierced his head just a few millimeters higher, it would’ve likely proved fatal.Instead, his surgery appears to have gone well, based off a post-surgery photo of the man offering a smile and gesturing with the peace sign.]]></description>

      <title>New Horizons is just two years away from its Kuiper Belt object flyby</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SPACE  NASA’s New Horizons mission is just two years away from its next target, a small Kuiper Belt object that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.New Horizons is scheduled to fly by 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, making it the most distant object humans have ever explored. 2014 MU69 measures between 25 km to 45 km across. Scientists are not sure how bright the object is. Its albedo reading, the measure of how much light reflects from a surface, may be 0.04 or slightly brighter. By comparison, Pluto has an albedo reading between 0.49 to 0.66, while Mars has a reading of 0.15.New Horizons is currently speeding at a velocity of 14.32 km per second relative to the sun. It is almost halfway between Pluto and its next target, a Kuiper Belt object called 2014 MU69. New Horizons was designed to fly well past Pluto. It carries extra hydrazine fuel for a Kuiper Belt object flyby and its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto.]]></description>

      <title>Alabama and Clemson are all set to for the College Football Playoff National Championship</title>
      <description><![CDATA[TAMPA, FLORIDA  After dominating both of their opponents in the College Football Playoff semifinals, Alabama and Clemson are headed down to Tampa in a rematch of last year’s national championship game. The Tigers are out for revenge, although it’ll be an uphill battle against undefeated Alabama.   Clemson star quarterback Deshaun Watson can do it all  including coughing it up  which hopefully he doesn’t. Wayne Gallman will look to tear up the backfield, but so will Watson. The Tigers have a solid receiving crew and definitely plan to get the ball in the hands of Mike Williams as much as possible. The Tide have been rolling all year with true freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts. Bama’s passing is still a work in progress, but who needs to throw when you have an amazing run game. If Bo Scarbrough gets out, Clemson could be done, and he’s Alabama’s third option.    Can Watson and the Tigers bring home their first championship since 1981? Or will Alabama win its second straight national title and its fifth in eight years?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[NORTH PORT, FLORIDA  A rabid bobcat bit a Fish and Wildlife officer in Venice, Florida.Wildlife officers were called in after the bobcat attacked the family dog and then ran into the house. The cat got into the house when homeowner Karen Morse heard her dog barking outside and opened the door. The dog Sammie, a five-pound Italian greyhound, also suffered five puncture wounds. The bobcat tested positive for rabies. Because the animal marked its territory in the house, everyone inside had to get rabies shots, including Morse’s grandsons who were visiting from North Carolina.The attack occurred four miles from where another bobcat attacked two men who were out walking. That animal has not been caught yet, Fox affiliate WTVT reported.Florida’s Department of Health has issued a rabies alert for Venice and North Port. The alert lasts for 60 days.]]></description>

      <title>China is giving its propaganda a facelift to reach out to Chinese millennials</title>
      <description><![CDATA[BEIJING  As China’s millennials have become more tech-savvy, the Chinese Communist Party has tried to retool its propaganda machine for a new audience.    Xi Jinping has forced propaganda officers to utilize digital media to resist foreign popular culture influences, and to target younger audiences, the New York Times reported.The party has invested millions in animated videos, while Chinese scholars copy TED-style talks to criticize the West. They even have lame “hip hop” groups that suck up to the CCP and warn about America’s efforts to topple the regime. And now even Apple is getting in on the selling out game. At the behest of Beijing, Apple has kicked the New York Times out of China’s Apple Store. Chinese law prohibits the publication of “harmful information”  aka reality  online.

      <title>Alcohol-sensing wristband lets you know how wasted you are</title>
      <description><![CDATA[SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA  Wearables are all the rage these days, and now there’s one that promises to turn most of us into responsible alcoholics.Proof, by Milo Sensors, is a wristband that functions like a fitness tracker, but tracks alcohol content instead of activity and discreetly displays it on your phone.According to Mashable, the wearable reads alcohol molecules in the skin and converts them to an electrical current, using a disposable cartridge that can last for up to 12 hours.It’s capable of predicting how drunk or sober the wearer is, and can send out alerts once a specific blood alcohol level is reached. There’s also an invite-only friends feature that allows the user to keep track of how much alcohol their loved ones have had.Proof is looking at a target price of $100 to $150, and is set to be crowdfunded sometime in 2017.]]></description>

      <title>High school principal admits he stole naked photos from students&#x2019; phones</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY  The porn-addicted former principal of an Elizabethtown, Kentucky high school is facing child pornography charges after admitting he confiscated students’ cell phones to trade their nude images online.Stephen Kyle Goodlett, 36, was indicted on Wednesday on federal kiddy porn charges after last month pleading not guilty to 63 state offenses, the Associated Press reported. The married father of three was arrested in October last year, then fired from his job after the offenses were discovered.Goodlett admitted to investigators that he is addicted to porn. He said he seized students’ phones and traded their naked photos for dirty images with a porn site based in Russia.The case came to light in September last year when a 20-year-old woman found naked photos of herself online. The sexy snaps were taken when she was aged just 15. The woman went to local cops, who called in federal investigators. The feds then tracked Goodlett down through his IP address.Investigators found at least 60 examples of child porn on the former LaRue County High School principal’s devices.The authorities are appealing for any of Goodlett’s former students who had their phones confiscated to come forward as they build a case against him.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[MAIDUGURI, NIGERIA  Nigerian army said on Thursday that they have found a schoolgirl who was kidnapped by Boko Haram insurgents. She was found with a baby in her arms.The girl has been identified as Rakiya Abubakar. She was found wandering in the Sambisa Forest along with a 6-month-old baby.  According to CNN, Abubakar told the soldiers that she was one of the girls kidnapped from Chibok Secondary School in April 2014.Nearly 300 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram insurgents from a boarding school in Chibok in April 2014.In May 2016, one of the girls escaped.

Meanwhile, the Nigeria’s defence department declared on Thursday that Boko Haram has been completely wiped out in the country.“Boko Haram is gone in Nigeria and it has gone for good. There is no Jupiter that can bring Boko Haram; what we are doing is to only sensitise citizens on the need to alert us on fleeing Boko Haram members. On the Chibok girls, our Operation Rescue Finale is still ongoing to rescue the girls,” Brigadier-General Rabe Abubakar, the Director of Defence Information in Nigeria, told the Daily Post.]]></description>

      <title>Llama on the loose! Police respond to calls about llama running around town</title>
      <description><![CDATA[OCONEE COUNTY, GEORGIA  Motorists had more than just other cars, bikes, and pedestrians to watch out for on the road after a llama was seen running around a town just outside of Athens.On Jan. 4, police responded to calls from citizens of a camel in the streets, but they quickly found out the suspect in question was actually an escaped llama, who’d somehow broken out of its owner’s property and decided to trot along down a busy highway. Police managed to corner the llama behind a dumpster in the back of a restaurant. The restaurant owner also provided a bag of carrots to lure the creature into custody, and its owner arrived with a van shortly afterward to bring the fearless camelid home to safety.During its adventure, the llama quickly rose to fame on social media, spotted by drivers both amused and confused by its presence.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[WINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA  Residents of a group home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina got a shocking surprise when an SUV crash-landed in their living room on Friday.The Winston-Salem Journal reports that 84-year-old Janice Harrison Clodfelter was driving when she suddenly passed out behind the wheel from a medical emergency.Her vehicle continued down the road at 70 to 90 miles per hour. It sped past an intersection before hitting a curb and going up an embankment.The white Buick SUV got launched into the air and crashed through the roof of a nearby house, right into the living room.The house was a residential facility for autistic adults, six of whom were home during the crash. With the vehicle blocking the exit, two were trapped in the living room and had to be helped out by witnesses who broke through the house’s front window.One of the witnesses also kept Clodfelter company until officers, firefighters and emergency medical personnel arrived to pull her out of the SUV. She was taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries.Firefighters later removed the car, pulling it back out through the hole in the roof.]]></description>

      <title>Black teens charged with hate crime for live streaming torture of disabled white man</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CHICAGO  Criminal charges have been filed against the four teens who streamed their despicable torture of a mentally disabled man on Facebook Live Tuesday afternoon.CBS Chicago reports that Jordan Hill, Tesfaye Cooper, and sisters Brittany and Tanishia Covington, are each facing hate crime charges, as well as felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.The 18-year-old victim was friends with Hill, who picked him up on Saturday from a suburban McDonald’s in what turned out to be a stolen van. They spent the next few days driving around and sleeping in the van, before driving to the Covington sisters’ West Side, Chicago home on Tuesday.There, a “play fight” escalated and the violence began. After being bound and gagged, the victim was beaten, taunted, and tortured for hours. A second video that surfaced on Wednesday shows he was also made to walk on all fours and forced to drink water from a toilet. He only escaped after the perps went to confront a neighbor who complained about the noise.The poor teen was so shaken by his ordeal he was hospitalized, but has since returned home to his family.Authorities sought hate crime charges because of the victim’s mental capacity and the suspects’ racist statements. And though many online blame the Black Lives Matter movement for the incident, no connection has been made by police.]]></description>

      <title>Honda unveils self-balancing motorcycle to keep riders in the saddle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS  Honda has unveiled a well-balanced piece of motorcycle tech designed to help riders stay in the saddle at low speeds.The Riding Assist concept bike has an adjustable front fork that assumes a wider angle to increase stability and its own motor attached to the front wheel, TechCrunch reported.As anyone who’s ever tried to maneuver a big bike out of a parking lot at low speed knows, keeping balance at 2 or 3 miles an hour is one of the trickiest aspects of riding.The bike was revealed earlier this week at tech tradeshow CES 2017 in Las Vegas. Although there’s no plans to bring it to market soon, the concept bike shows how Honda’s investment in robotics can have spin-off benefits for its vehicles.The technology behind the Riding Assist bike was honed in the development of both Honda’s humanoid Asimo robot and UNI-CUB scooter, according to TechCrunch.Personal robots like Asimo are likely still a decade away from being ready to be sold to consumers.However, the legacy technology from the development of Asimo and the UNI-CUB could help bring real improvements to Honda’s vehicles much sooner than that.]]></description>

      <title>Congressman&#x2019;s son drops a dab on House Speaker Paul Ryan</title>
      <description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON  A Congressman’s son was grounded by his dad this week for teaching House Speaker Paul Ryan how to dab.Cal Marshall, 17, is the son of Roger Marshall, the Republican representative for the First District of Kansas.Young Cal caused a bit of confusion at his dad’s swearing-in photo call on Tuesday, when Ryan asked if he was leaning into his elbow to sneeze. But no, like countless sports stars, performers and 12-year-old kids over the past two years or so, Cal was dropping a dab on ’em folks, the New York Times reported.Afterward, Cal wrote on Twitter that he was surprised by the media coverage of his antics. But the House Speaker failed to see the funny side, posting on Twitter that he was still clueless about dabbing. In the end, Ryan got the last laugh. Congressman Marshall posted on Twitter that Cal was now grounded, which should give the teenager time to work on some new dance moves.]]></description>

      <title>What the hell!? Ominous demon photo goes viral on Facebook</title>
      <description><![CDATA[LAVEEN, ARIZONA  This photo of what appears to be some sort of winged creature has gone viral, with some saying it’s a demon, while others insist it’s an angel. Richard Christianson from Laveen, Arizona posted the photo on Facebook on Jan. 1. In his post, Christianson asked: “What the hell do you see in this picture for reals ??? Anybody.”The post was shared 80,000 times before Christianson took it down on Wednesday. But many people are skeptical, suggesting the dark shape looming over the sidewalk is likely just a tree or a Photoshop job. However, Facebook user Crissy Love seems convinced of the photo’s authenticity. Love noted that there weren’t any palm trees in Laveen that look like a demon. “I knew Laveen was haunted,” she wrote. But what do you think? Is this just a tree shaped like a winged spirit? A Photoshop stunt? Or is it evidence of the supernatural? Let us know in the comments.]]></description>

      <title>Megyn Kelly is ditching FOX News for NBC News</title>
      <description><![CDATA[NEW YORK  After 12 long years of being fair and balanced at Fox News, anchor Megyn Kelly is leaving to take on a broad new role at NBC News. Kelly will host her own daytime news and talk show, anchor an in-depth Sunday night news show as well as take on a role in NBC’s breaking news coverage, the New York Times reported. The anchor’s move will shake things up in the land of cable news where she had become the second-most watched host after Bill O’Reilly of Fox News. Kelly’s exit also throws a wrench into Fox News’ primetime lineup, and adds to the drama following the Roger Ailes sexual harassment scandal.   NBC is probably hoping that the addition of Kelly will get more conservative viewers to flip to their channel, but will it work?]]></description>
