Wildlife officers were called in after the bobcat attacked the family dog and then ran into the house. The cat got into the house when homeowner Karen Morse heard her dog barking outside and opened the door. 

The dog Sammie, a five-pound Italian greyhound, also suffered five puncture wounds. The bobcat tested positive for rabies. Because the animal marked its territory in the house, everyone inside had to get rabies shots, including Morse&#x2019;s grandsons who were visiting from North Carolina.

The attack occurred four miles from where another bobcat attacked two men who were out walking. That animal has not been caught yet, Fox affiliate WTVT reported.

Florida&#x2019;s Department of Health has issued a rabies alert for Venice and North Port. The alert lasts for 60 days.</description><tags>TomoNews,News,Politics,Education,Educational,News &amp; Politics,Bobcat,bobcat attacks human,rabid bobcat attacks officer,bobcat florida attack,wild animal attacks</tags><guid>MCP1_3248825</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2017 00:58:00 -0800</pubDate><duration>117</duration><media:thumbnail url="http://sa-mcp.s3.amazonaws.com/up-image/069/50D/06950D8B101B40B99261A61139BDE110_160x90.jpg"/><media:group><media:content url="http://video-pdu.us.tomonews.net/mcp/us/614/17/01/07/3248825/3248825_1195A876C16F4FD3804DF7EBA01BCE4A_170107_3248825_Video_shows_ferocious_rabid_bobcat_attacks_wildl_2600.mp4" type="video/mp4" bitrate="2600" width="1280" height="720"/><media:content url="https://sa-mcp.s3.amazonaws.com/up-video/B1C/1F9/B1C1F9AAB0C14D66AB3FAD93ABE1977A" type="video/mp4" bitrate="800" width="960" height="540"/></media:group></item><item><title>China is giving its propaganda a facelift to reach out to Chinese millennials</title><description>BEIJING &#x2014; As China&#x2019;s millennials have become more tech-savvy, the Chinese Communist Party has tried to retool its propaganda machine for a new audience.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the number of giraffes in the wild has declined by about 40 percent in the last three decades, the New York Times reported.

Giraffes, the world&#x2019;s tallest land mammal, are mostly found in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa.

In 1985, there were approximately 163,000 giraffes in the wild, but that number now stands at around 97,000, according to the IUCN report.

However, of the nine giraffe subspecies, three are increasing in number and one is stable. The five other subspecies are decreasing in population size.

The biggest threats to giraffes&#x2019; survival are the encroachment of humans, poaching, destruction of their habitat by economic activity such as mining, and war.

The IUCN monitors endangered species on its Red List. The organization now classifies giraffes as vulnerable, meaning the species faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.</description><tags>TomoNews,News,Politics,Education,Educational,News &amp; Politics,Giraffe,giraffes,giraffes in danger,giraffes under threat,giraffes extinction,giraffe in africa,IUCN red list,conservation</tags><guid>MCP1_3227438</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 01:44:00 -0800</pubDate><duration>78</duration><media:thumbnail url="http://sa-mcp.s3.amazonaws.com/up-image/F26/873/F26873656B0C460CBB796937D28BB733_160x90.jpg"/><media:group><media:content url="http://video-pdu.us.tomonews.net/mcp/us/614/16/12/09/3227438/3227438_3C905DBA6AC24FA2A80666DA5E787AE4_161209_3227438_We_used_to_think_giraffes_were_OK__now_they_face_600.mp4" type="video/mp4" bitrate="600" width="640" height="360"/><media:content url="https://sa-mcp.s3.amazonaws.com/up-video/86D/EA8/86DEA82CD5784C7388E692546D6AA5F6" type="video/mp4" bitrate="800" width="960" height="540"/></media:group></item><item><title>Vietnam begins dredging on Ladd Reef in disputed South China Sea</title><description>LADD REEF, SOUTH CHINA SEA &#x2014; Satellite images taken by a U.S. based firm revealed suspected dredging work on Ladd Reef, a coral reef controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea.

Ladd Reef is about 450 km from Vietnam&#x2019;s southeastern coast and is completely submerged at high tide. It has a 42-meter-tall lighthouse, which is operated by a small number of Vietnam soldiers and worker.

Analysts told Reuters that such dredging work could be the precursor to more extensive construction on other reefs, and Ladd Reef might be used to boost access for supply ships and fishing boats. It could also help defend the nearby Spratly Islands, where Vietnam has expanded its airstrip.

Vietnam is one of the many nations that claims the South China Sea as part of its territory. China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also made claims in the region. Vietnam has become China&#x2019;s main rival in the disputed South China Sea. According to Reuters, the mobile rocket launchers installed on several islands controlled by Vietnam are capable of striking China&#x2019;s runway and military installations.</description><tags>TomoNews,News,Politics,Education,Educational,News &amp; Politics,Ladd reef,vietnam,south china sea claims,south china sea dispute,spratly islands dispute vietnam south china sea dredging</tags><guid>MCP1_3227385</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 01:09:00 -0800</pubDate><duration>87</duration><media:thumbnail url="http://sa-mcp.s3.amazonaws.com/up-image/9E5/DC6/9E5DC679DBE64B4BAC265C22D7E5695D_160x90.jpg"/><media:group><media:content url="http://video-pdu.us.tomonews.net/mcp/us/614/16/12/09/3227385/3227385_BFB3DB959220495C80D03D0763CB904B_161209_3227385_Vietnam_begins_dredging_on_Ladd_Reef_in_disputed_600.mp4" type="video/mp4" bitrate="600" width="640" height="360"/><media:content url="https://sa-mcp.s3.amazonaws.com/up-video/BD5/F1B/BD5F1B6625BA4C44ABBF367A9452A2AF" type="video/mp4" bitrate="800" width="960" height="540"/></media:group></item><item><title>The &#x2018;nuclear football&#x2019; &#x2014; the mysterious briefcase that follows the U.S. president</title><description>WASHINGTON  &#x2014; The mysterious &#x201C;nuclear football&#x201D; that contains classified information to allow the U.S. president to order a nuclear attack at anytime and from anywhere in the world is about to be handed over to president-elect Donald Trump.

The &#x201C;nuclear football&#x201D; is formally known as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It contains four things: a folder of instructions for the Emergency Broadcast System; a black book of strike options, another book that lists secure shelters for the president, and a card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. It also allows the president to communicate with the Pentagon from any location.

The briefcase is hand-carried by one of five military aides. In order to qualify for the responsibility, the candidate must pass a special security investigation known as &#x201C;Yankee White.&#x201D; The criteria for the position includes having U.S. citizenship, possessing unquestionable loyalty to the country, and the individual, his or her family or anyone the individual is closely linked with must be absolutely devoid of foreign influence. The officer carrying the &#x2018;football&#x2019; must always be within reach of the president.

If the president decides to deploy nuclear weapons, he must use a special code on the card to verify his identity, which has to be confirmed by the Secretary of Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense no veto power over the president&#x2019;s decision.

The black book contains a menu of nuclear strike options, allowing the president to choose to eliminate all of the country&#x2019;s enemies at once, or to only target individual countries. Once the orders have been verified, the military issues the attack.</description><tags>TomoNews,News,Politics,Education,Educational,News &amp; Politics,Nuclear football,nuclear briefcase,us president nuclear football,trump and nuclear football,pentagon,us president nuclear power</tags><guid>MCP1_3227326</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 00:20:00 -0800</pubDate><duration>108</duration><media:thumbnail url="http://sa-mcp.s3.amazonaws.com/up-image/BD4/A3A/BD4A3AAEE6C8430EA3B251FD953E45BB_160x90.jpg"/><media:group><media:content url="http://video-pdu.us.tomonews.net/mcp/us/614/16/12/09/3227326/3227326_A058811512BC481A95F208BAF67D78F2_161209_3227326_The____nuclear_football________the_mysterious_br_600.mp4" type="video/mp4" bitrate="600" width="640" height="360"/><media:content url="https://sa-mcp.s3.amazonaws.com/up-video/AE6/6ED/AE66ED47079B41B6B5F7DAEE1A1980EE" type="video/mp4" bitrate="800" width="960" height="540"/></media:group></item></channel></rss>
