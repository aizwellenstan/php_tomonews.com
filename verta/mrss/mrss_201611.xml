      <title>Trump and Putin: Donald and Vladimir are brothers from another mother for life</title>
      <description>NEW YORK &#x2014; It&#x2019;s widely known Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin are mutual fans of one another. 


Last week, Putin praised the billionaire real estate mogul for energizing U.S. voters &#x201C;tired of the elites&#x201D; while continuing to deny that Russia is attempting to influence the presidential election, NBC News reported. 


The U.S. Department of Homeland Security accused the Kremlin of hacking the Democratic National Committee email servers earlier this year, according to NBC News. 


Clinton&#x2019;s campaign has blamed the Russians of hacking campaign chairman John Podesta&#x2019;s email account, although Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has denied Russia&#x2019;s involvement in giving him materiel, NBC News reported. 


Trump for his part has thrown praise on Putin time and time again throughout his campaign. 


How will their relationship grow if Trump gets into the White House? Guess we&#x2019;ll all have to wait and see.</description>

      <title>Ex-Thai porn actress finds millionaire hubby after converting to Buddhism</title>
      <description>BANGKOK, THAILAND &#x2014; An ex-adult video star from Thailand gave up her career to follow the path of Buddhism, and she believes that life choice has landed her a millionaire sugar daddy.


The 31-year-old Nong Nat has appeared in many different erotic movies, until she was prosecuted for violating Thailand&#x2019;s anti-pornography laws


Originally a Christian, the ex-actress reportedly decided to convert to Buddhism and began praying constantly.


In 2012, Nong Nat became a devout Buddhist and married the 70-year-old American millionaire architect Harold Jennings Nesland Jr who is old enough to be Nong Nat&#x2019;s father. 


To explain the new life she is having, she told UK&#x2019;s South West News Service &#x201C;prayers and meditation get you a good husband&#x201D;.


And apart from receiving a monthly payment from her husband, Nat also said he splits his money with her 50/50.


With regard to her current life, Nat said she is taking Buddhism very seriously. She said, &#x201C;Buddhism changed my mind a lot, it changed the way I lived my life. I'm a lot happier now.&#x201D;</description>

      <title>Machete attack video: Nutcase rages through New Orleans airport wielding machete</title>
      <description>NEW ORLEANS &#x2014; Newly released surveillance footage shows the moment a psycho pulled a machete and began to attack people at New Orleans international airport last March.


The footage from the March 2015 was obtained by the New Orleans Advocate.


The disturbing incident began around 7:30 p.m. on March 20, with the video showing Richard White calmly walking towards a TSA line holding a paper bag.


He violently sprays the crowd with wasp spray, before pulling out a machete from his waistband and attempting to slash people.


The 63-year-old targeted another TSA agent, spraying him in the face before chasing him with the blade. Another angle of the footage shows him inches away from harming his first, but he was killed by three shots from local cop Heather Sylve.


White died the next day, after refusing treatment due to his beliefs as a Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness, reported the New Orleans Advocate.


Officials found a molotov cocktail, grill lighter, and plastic letter opener in the paper bag White dropped during the attack, and have since ruled the shooting as justified.</description>

      <title>Oral ladybug infestation: vet discovers 40 Asian lady beetles clinging to dog&#x2019;s mouth</title>
      <description>HOISINGTON, KANSAS &#x2014; A dog known for having a passion for biting bugs finally got bit back.


Over the past few weeks, Bailey the dog had been sleeping more than usual. When it came time to eat, her owner noticed she wasn&#x2019;t interested in her food and was skipping meals. The owner became alarmed when she noticed Bailey had begun foaming at the mouth.


Concerned, she took Bailey to the vet, who discovered between 30 and 40 orange ladybugs, or more accurately referred to as Asian lady beetles, hanging off the roof of the dog&#x2019;s mouth.


The Asian lady beetles pack a painful bite, which can cause ulcers on a dog&#x2019;s tongue and mouth if left unchecked. The veterinarian says if found, pet owners can solve the problem by picking them off, one by one. The veterinarian cautions that the beetles should not be squished, as they produce a powerful stench and yellow secretion if crushed.


The Asian lady beetles have made their presence felt across Kansas recently because one of their main food sources, sugarcane aphids, have sprung up in large numbers. Their population swell has led to many dogs in the region being brought in with the same oral affliction.</description>

      <title>Fast food shooting: surveillance cam shows worker shot dead at California Jack in the Box</title>
      <description>EL MONTE, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; Police in the Los Angeles area are on the hunt for the man in this video, who can be seen shooting dead a fast food restaurant employee during a robbery attempt that came up empty.


On the night of October 21, the suspect entered the Jack in the Box in El Monte, California, wearing a blue cap and a Halloween mask. Armed with a handgun, the thief then hopped over the counter and pulled the firearm on two employees working in the back. 25-year-old Juan Manuel Vidal happened to be one of them.


The masked man demanded Vidal hand over the cash available in the restaurant, but there was none to be had. Police say the thug then made a physical attempt to retrieve the money, but when he came up empty, he decided to take Vidal&#x2019;s life instead. 


After pulling the trigger, the gunman wasted no time in making his getaway, hopping the counter and bolting out of the burger joint toward a getaway vehicle parked down the street. The car raced away, and has not yet been tracked down. Meanwhile, Juan Manuel Vidal lay bleeding in the back of the restaurant, suffering a gunshot wound to his upper torso.


The L.A. County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department is asking for the public&#x2019;s help to track down the gunman and his accomplice, as the victim&#x2019;s mother mourns the loss of her son, pleading for someone to help bring her justice. Juan Manuel Vidal had recently graduated as a pharmacy technician, and was engaged to marry his high school sweetheart at the time of his death. 


Anyone with information regarding the incident has been asked to contact police, as the search for Juan Vidal&#x2019;s killer continues.</description>

      <title>Korean-American adoptee Adam Crasper faces deportation after 37 years living in the U.S.</title>
      <description>TACOMA, WASHINGTON &#x2014; Adam Crasper, an adoptee who came to America from South Korea aged 3, is set to be deported back there &#x2014; a place that&#x2019;s like another planet to him.


The 40-year-old father from Washington State came to the U.S. with his older sister in 1979, but, seven years later their first family abandoned them and the siblings were separated by adoption services. 


Those same parents reportedly didn&#x2019;t complete Adam&#x2019;s citizenship papers. In 2000, a law was brought into place that would grant automatic citizenship to all adopted children of American parents aged 18 and younger. But by then Adam was in his 20s and didn&#x2019;t qualify.


After spending time in foster homes, the 12-year-old Adam came into the care of Thomas and Dolly Crasper. Adam was physically abused while in their care. In the early 90s the Craspers were charged with physical child abuse, sexual abuse and rape. Thomas did 90 days in jail, while Dolly reportedly served 3 years&#x2019; probation, the Associated Press reported.


Adam&#x2019;s run-ins with the law began when he broke into the Crasper&#x2019;s home to get his Korean Bible and rubber shoes &#x2014; mementos from Korea. Adam&#x2019;s later criminal activity included assaulting a roommate, and jacking cars. 


Now a husband and father of two daughters, Adam tried to renew his green card earlier this year but that didn&#x2019;t go as planned. Authorities detained him at an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington for 9 months when they discovered his criminal record.


Desperate to get out and see his family, Adam waived an appeal against his deportation, AP reported. And as soon as authorities get his paperwork in order, Adam will be deported to South Korea from the U.S &#x2014; his home of nearly 40 years.</description>

      <title>California National Guard: Pentagon suspends bonus repayments after public outrage</title>
      <description>WASHINGTON &#x2014;  A decade ago, the Pentagon needed soldiers to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, so it decided to entice troops by offering bonuses of $15,000 or more to reenlist. 


In 2010, after reports surfaced of erroneous overpayments, a federal investigation discovered widespread fraud and mismanagement by California National Guard officials, which led to bonuses and student loan payments given to soldiers who did not qualify for them, the Los Angeles Times reported.   


Nearly 10,000 soldiers were ordered to back pay back enlistment bonuses &#x2014; with interest. Those that refused had their wages garnished and were hit with tax liens.


To avoid a public relations disaster, the Pentagon suspended debt collection on Wednesday after criticism from Republicans and Democrats in Congress. 


The announcement does not end the reimbursement process, but postpones collections efforts until the government comes up with a long-term solution, according to the Associated Press.</description>

      <title>Emotional support duck riding on airplane goes viral online</title>
      <description>ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; On Oct. 16, a man flying from Milwaukee to Asheville, North Carolina happened to notice a peculiar-looking passenger waddling onto the plane, and tweeted out a picture that&#x2019;s thrown the internet into a frenzy. 


Affectionately named Daniel Turducken Stinkerbutt by his owner, the duck photographed is legally certified as an emotional support animal. His owner, Carla Fitzgerald, used to drive a horse-drawn carriage, but then a car slammed into her from behind and sent her flying. Four years later she still suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The duck supposedly senses when she&#x2019;s stressed, and nuzzles and cuddles her to reduces her anxiety. Daniel not only flies with Fitzgerald, he also goes to movies and church, always on a leash, and wearing a diaper. 


The only requirements to have a pet certified as an emotional support animal are that the owner is considered emotionally disabled by a licensed mental health professional, and that the animal is manageable in public.


In the U.S., animals are allowed to accompany their owners in the airplane cabin at no extra cost, as long as they are needed for support reasons. Typical domestic animals like cats, dogs, mice, rabbits, birds, rats, small pigs, hedgehogs and ferrets can be certified to fly, but cases of more unusual creatures have also been reported as emotional support animals such as turkeys, turtles, snakes, llamas.</description>

      <title>WhatsApp pics: Mom mad after profile photo &#x2018;turned on&#x2019; creepy Yodel delivery driver</title>
      <description>STAFFORD, UNITED KINGDOM &#x2014;  A British mother of one is pissed after a delivery driver told her that her WhatsApp photo turned him on. 


According to British tabloid the Sun, Rhian Davies ordered some make up last week, but she&#x2019;d had some missed calls from an unknown number, so she contacted it via WhatsApp.


It turns out it was a driver for Yodel, a British delivery service. When he saw Rhian&#x2019;s WhatsApp profile photo, he told her he was &#x201C;turned on&#x201D; by it.


Rhian got mad and creeped out by the guy and decided to report him, but he said she shouldn&#x2019;t be showing cleavage in her WhatsApp profile photo. After that exchange, he tried to call her on Sunday night, so she blocked his number. 


That horned up driver remained nameless throughout their interaction, but his WhatsApp status reportedly read &#x201C;I-LOVE-DAWAT-E-ISLAMI&#x201D; &#x2014; an apparent reference to the Pakistan-based Islamic group.


Yodel didn&#x2019;t reply to Rhian&#x2019;s complaint email about the driver, but said they&#x2019;re now investigating it.</description>

      <title>Aussie actress Caitlin Stasey wants to freely post nude selfies on Instagram</title>
      <description>LOS ANGELES &#x2014; Australian actress Caitlin Stasey wants Instagram to &#x201C;embrace the female form&#x201D; by letting her put up nude selfies.


The Sun reports that the Reign star has been known to share saucy snaps on her account despite the site&#x2019;s no-nudity rules. She&#x2019;s had her racy pics deleted as a result and no doubt earned the wrath of Instagram&#x2019;s bosses.


Stasey is angry and frustrated about the censorship and finds it ridiculous that her photos have been taken down. An advocate of the Free the Nipple campaign, Stasey finds it unfair that topless shots of men are accepted under Instagram&#x2019;s guidelines.  


In a tirade on Twitter, the actress claimed about a dozen photos of her with her nipples exposed have been taken down from her account, including those of her as a kid.


There&#x2019;s talk that her account might get suspended, though it may be something her 996 followers won&#x2019;t stand for.</description>

      <title>Bill Clinton First Gentleman: Bill is going to be an amazing first FGOTUS</title>
      <description>WASHINGTON &#x2014; Back when Bill Clinton was Arkansas governor, he developed quite a taste for Taiwan. 


He visited four times as governor and developed the habit of disappearing every night on his two later trips. Word is he was getting into someone at the Foreign Ministry. 


Reporters from our sister publication Next Magazine were able to verify that the rumors were true, although they never published the story. According to them, Bill would pretend to be sick so that he could cancel all his engagements in order to spend time with the mystery woman. 


Taiwan is looking forward to having Bill back in the White House, even if it is only as First Gentleman. 


As First Gentleman, Bill will have several roles to fill. He&#x2019;ll have to take care of the White House while Hillary is busy running the country. 


Bill will also be in charge of all social and ceremonial functions at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 


The First Dude will need some pet projects and some type of social cause to champion.


As FGOTUS, Bill will also be traveling a lot internationally. Guess that means our foreign relations should improve significantly.</description>

      <title>New Jersey State Trooper pulls drowning deer from swimming pool to safety</title>
      <description>HARMONY TOWNSHIP, NEW JERSEY &#x2014; When it comes to saving a life, be it human or animal, New Jersey State Trooper Dwayne Phillips will do what it takes to come to the rescue.


At 12:39 p.m. on Oct. 21, a worker reportedly caught sight of a deer drowning in a nearby swimming pool. Officer Phillips was called to the residence and found the deer, noticeably exhausted and sinking fast. 


The trooper wasn&#x2019;t professionally trained to handle deer rescues, but when a life was on the line, this good cop sprung into action, pulling the frightened buck to safety. After the deer was able to catch its breath and calm down after the nightmarish fall, it gathered itself and took off back into the woods.


A heroic deed is its own reward, but the New Jersey State Police posted the story to Facebook, commending its Trooper of the Day. The photo has received more than 15,000 likes and 3,100 shares since being published on Oct. 23.</description>

      <title>Mullet boy told to reconsider defamation case against the media for publishing memes</title>
      <description>SYDNEY &#x2014; We had completely forgotten about Australian teen Ziggy Mosslmani, who was ridiculed by the Internet for rocking a mullet at a party last year. And what a mullet is was! But Mosslmani and his Kentucky waterfall are going viral again after the 18-year-old filed lawsuits against several high-profile media organizations for publishing stories commenting on the memes spawned from his hairstyle. 


The news organizations named in the lawsuits &#x2014; the Daily Mail, Sydney&#x2019;s Daily Telegraph and the Australian Radio Network &#x2014; picked up on Mosslmani&#x2019;s fame after a professional photographer published the original photo to Facebook. That photo was the catalyst for a parade of memes, depicting Mosslmani and his Canadian passport on Mt. Rushmore, as the head of a horse, and with people playing &#x201C;pin the tail on the donkey&#x201D; using his mullet as the tail.


Mosslmani&#x2019;s lawsuits claim the news outlets inferred he was both ridiculous and ugly. But the presiding judge has pushed back on the defamation cases. District Court judge Judith Gibson mulled over the evidence and declared that Mosslmani&#x2019;s Texas tailgate &#x201C;generated a great deal of interest on the internet, most of it humorous.&#x201D; She advised Mullet Boy and his lawyers to file an amended statement of claim before the trial proceedings on Nov. 17.</description>

      <title>Good Samaritan: Man wearing Native American headdress disarms shooter on Portland train</title>
      <description>PORTLAND, OREGON &#x2014; A good Samaritan helped disarm a gun-wielding teenager on a Portland light rail train while rocking a Native American headdress.


KGW reports that the teen shooter was on the train around 8:34 p.m. on Tuesday when he was confronted by a man he knew about missing money.


The two got into a heated argument, during which the teen took out a gun. He fired two shots, which luckily didn&#x2019;t hit his intended victim or anyone else.


As the MAX train approached 102nd Avenue station on East Burnside street, Rambo Richardson was waiting on the platform. Richardson, who later said he was out that day to get some weed from Oregon&#x2019;s Best Meds, saw the scuffle inside and decided to help.


When Richardson rushed inside the train, he saw the victim had more or less overpowered the shooter and already had him in a headlock. He quickly took the gun from the shooter&#x2019;s hands and held onto it until police arrived.


Local media quickly declared Richardson a hero, though he points out in several posts on Facebook that he doesn&#x2019;t deserve full credit, as it was a team effort between him and the shooter&#x2019;s intended victim, a man named Miguel.</description>

      <title>Man falls to death: Denver Broncos fan falls 60 feet and dies at Mile High Stadium</title>
      <description>DENVER &#x2014; A 36-year-old father of five was killed this week in a horrorific accident following the Monday night game between the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans.


The accident took place in an enclosed stairwell at the Broncos&#x2019; Mile High Stadium.


According to CBS 4 in Denver, Jason Coy was sitting on the railing of a stadium stairwell at around 9:45 p.m. when he lost his balance and fells backwards. A witness described the accident as &#x201C;pretty gruesome,&#x201D; explaining that Coy hit his head at every level on the way down. 


Coy fell around 60 feet before hitting the ground. He is said to have died from blunt force trauma injuries.


A GoFundMe page has been set up to help Coy&#x2019;s family. He leaves behind his stay-at-home wife and their five young kids.</description>

      <title>Man amputates toes infected with gangrene using pliers because NHS waiting lists</title>
      <description>DEVON, ENGLAND &#x2014; Paul Dibbins, from Devon in England, was desperate to save his leg from the clutches of a deadly infection, so desperate that he decided to take matters into his own hands.


The Torquay Herald Express reports that the diabetic former soldier&#x2019;s toe troubles started in March 2015, when he got frostbite after fixing a car in freezing weather.


His right leg was set to be amputated from the knee down due to complications with his diabetes. But doctors had to tend to another emergency and the surgery was cancelled at the last minute.


Dibbins claims the hospital never called him to reschedule the procedure, so he spent the next nine months treating his own wounds. His efforts paid off, as the foot started healing.


Unfortunately, his toes became infected with gas gangrene, which can be deadly.
Doctors told him the toes had to be removed, but that he had to wait six weeks for an operation.


The former army lance corporal decided to do the amputation himself, and used pliers to cut off bone and tendon to rid himself of the gangrenous appendages. He didn&#x2019;t take any painkillers, and only bit down onto a towel for the pain.


A surgeon who saw what he did on his foot called him crazy, but praised the work and called it &#x201C;textbook.&#x201D;</description>

      <title>Flash mob riot: Rampaging teenagers attack students, cops and horse in Philadelphia</title>
      <description>PHILADELPHIA &#x2014; A crazed flash mob of 200 teenagers went on the rampage in the streets near Philadelphia&#x2019;s Temple University last Friday, attacking anyone unlucky enough to cross its path.


The massive group of teens had descended on an off-campus movie theatre, responding to a social media invite to see a show. 


When the movie sold out, the people who couldn&#x2019;t get in turned violent quickly. At least six students were picked off in the streets and beaten up badly.


When a Temple University patrol officer stepped in to stop a boy from throwing rocks at cars, she was taken to the ground and also attacked. 


Mounted police were then sent in to break up the mob and bring calm to the chaos, only to have a 15-year-old kid run up and punch a police horse in the face.


Victim Christina Lauletta was coming home from a school football game when she was kicked and stomped repeatedly. Luckily, she didn&#x2019;t suffer any broken bones. 


Another student said she was walking with her boyfriend when the mob separated the two and punched her in the face. 


Some 50 juveniles were taken into custody, leading to four arrests on charges of resisting arrest, assault, and robbery.</description>

      <title>3D printed heart on a computer chip could spell the end for drug testing on animals</title>
      <description>CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS &#x2014; Harvard scientists have developed a 3D printed heart on a computer chip, which can be used to study heart conditions without testing medical treatments on animals.


The heart-on-chip is composed of a small piece of flexible polymer with integrated sensors that contains living human heart cells, which can mimic the physiological response of a human heart.


The sensors collect data on the beating of the heart-on-chip, which can be used to study how tissue responds to drugs or toxins.


Scientists from the Wyss Institute at Harvard University believe the technology is a more accurate alternative to testing drugs on animals, and hope it can decrease the number of animals used for testing.


&#x201C;We are pushing the boundaries of three-dimensional printing by developing and integrating multiple functional materials within printed devices,&#x201D; Jennifer Lewis, senior co-author of the study said in a press release.


Other organs, including bones, lungs, the liver, and gut can also be made into organs on a chip. 


However, it is noted that obtaining data from these chips is costly and can only be done using high-speed cameras or microscopy.</description>

      <title>World Series 2016: Cubs and Indians go for the glory in the World Series</title>
      <description>CLEVELAND &#x2014; Fans in Cleveland and Chicago have been waiting an eternity for a chance at the World Series. The Indians haven&#x2019;t won a title since 1948, and the Cubs haven&#x2019;t won since 1908. 


Both clubs have great pitching, although the Cubs have a few more aces up their sleeve. 


Lester and Kluber battled it out in Game 1, with Kluber coming out on top. 


Arrieta is starting Game 2 and Bauer should be okay as long as his pinky stays on.


The Cubs have a power packed lineup with Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo as well as a great supporting cast.


The Indians also bring the pain with Mike Napoli and Carlos Santana, backed up by some equally impressive supporting players. 


Could Cleveland actually bring home another championship this year? Or will the Cubs finally end over a century&#x2019;s worth of disappointment?</description>

      <title>One punch KO: Student knocks out classmate for hitting teacher during classroom fight</title>
      <description>&#x2019;MERICA &#x2014; A 50-second video clip that shows a student knocking out his classmate for hitting their teacher during a fracas has gone viral.


The video, published to Twitter on Oct. 24, shows two students going at it as their teacher intervenes to break things up. Suddenly, one of the students begins swinging wildly at the teacher. When he connects, the tough guy refocuses his energy on his original target. That&#x2019;s when an enforcer steps in.


A fellow student takes exception to his classmate striking a teacher, and makes his point by cracking the troublemaker in the face. He pulls the instigator&#x2019;s opponent off of him, flexes his muscles and yells at him to get his head in check. 


Once the offender has some sense knocked into him, the teacher, shaken up, attempts to return calm to her classroom. It is unknown why the fight started or where it took place, but Twitter user @B1GoingD1 has accumulated more than 45,000 likes and 40,000 retweets.</description>

      <title>Robot sex conference relocates to London after being banned by Malaysian police</title>
      <description>LONDON &#x2014; The second annual Love and Sex with Robots conference was supposed to be held in Iskandar, Malaysia, until the Chief of Police deemed it &#x201C;ridiculous,&#x201D; stating there was &#x201C;nothing scientific about having sex with machines.&#x201D;


Organizers for the conference have rescheduled the event, which will now take place at the University of London. Among the many fascinating topics being discussed at this year&#x2019;s conference are Robot Emotions, Roboethics, Robot Personalities, and Intelligent Electronic Sex Hardware, Clone Robots, and many more. 


The future is full of possibilities when it comes to love, sex, and robots. Some scientists argue that they won&#x2019;t just cater to everyday kink, they&#x2019;ll also be able to reduce the incidence of sex crimes by allowing would-be offenders to take out their fantasies on robots.


There is a field of belief that by 2050, sex with robots may have overtaken sex with humans. 


The Love and Sex with Robots conference is now scheduled to take place December 19-20 at The University of London.</description>

      <title>Teens attack old man who asked them to step off his lawn: girls arrested for assault</title>
      <description>SYRACUSE, NEW YORK &#x2014; Two teens in Syracuse have been arrested for assaulting a 62-year-old man who asked them to get off his lawn.


The girls, age 14 and 15, were among a group of other friends, hanging out on a residential street. The elderly man supposedly noticed them soliciting in his front yard, and decided to let them know they were overstepping on his property.


When he walked outside with his cane to politely ask them to leave, one of the girls slaps him without hesitation. Shortly after, another one hits him in the face and knocks his hat off, as the crowd of girls runs away. The video ends with the elderly man tripping to the ground as he was trying to chase them down the street. 


Detectives working on the case were able to identify the two girls involved in the attack, tracking them down the next day. They face charges of misdemeanor third-degree assault.</description>

      <title>Murder suspect streams getaway video on Facebook Live while on the run from cops</title>
      <description>WELLSTON, OKLAHOMA &#x2014; A man who went on a crime spree in Oklahoma is now being hunted by police after killing two people and shooting two others.


The Oklahoman reports that two officers responding to a disturbance call in Wellston on Sunday were shot by Michael Vance, first with a handgun, and then with an AK-47.


One of the officers managed to shoot Vance in the shoulder, just before he escaped in a stolen police pickup truck.


While on the run, Vance live-streamed a video of himself to Facebook. The footage shows him behind the wheel with blood on his shirt, showing off his firearm. He tells people to &#x201C;stay tuned to the local news&#x201D; if they want to find out what happens next, declaring that &#x201C;this is where it gets interesting.&#x201D;


Police say he drove to a nearby mobile home park and hijacked a second car, shooting at a trailer on his way out and injuring a woman inside. From there, he made his way to his relatives&#x2019; house in Luther, where is believed to have he shot his uncle and stabbed his aunt to death.


Both victims were found with large cuts to the neck, consistent with an attempted beheading. The aunt also had a deep cut around her shoulder, suggesting Vance had tried to cut off her arm.


Authorities believe he then stole the couple&#x2019;s gray Mitsubishi Eclipse and fled in it.


Vance was last seen at a gas station in Sayre, where he shot at a man and attempted to steal his motor home, but failed.


The 38-year-old suspect is still at large as of Monday night, with wanted posters describing him as armed and dangerous. Police also believe he has HIV and is willing to spread it.</description>

      <title>Clown sightings: Clowns banned from Halloween thanks to mass hysteria</title>
      <description>AMERICA &#x2014; Clowns are too scary for Halloween. As clown fears and hysteria grip America, clowns are finding themselves banned from participating in Halloween festivities. 


Stores have pulled clown masks from their shelves. School districts, counties and festival organizers are banning clown costumes. You can&#x2019;t even wear a fake red nose in public without being stopped and harassed in public.


How did America find itself in such a pitiful state? How did America become so afraid? As the saying goes: you can judge a country by the way it treats its clowns.</description>

      <title>Tour bus crash: 13 killed, 31 injured after bus crashes into semi-truck in California</title>
      <description>PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; Several people were killed and dozens more injured in a bus crash in California on Sunday morning.


The Desert Sun reports that a USA Holiday tour bus was returning to Los Angeles from the Red Earth Casino near the Salton Sea early Sunday.


It was 5 a.m., and almost all of the 43 passengers on board were asleep. As the bus drove westbound along Interstate 10, it crashed hard into a semi-truck just near Palm Springs.


The bus plowed about 15 feet into the semi, completely demolished the front of the vehicle. Thirteen people died as a result, including the driver.


Thirty-one others survived the terrifying ordeal. They were rescued from the wreckage and treated for their injuries.


Authorities are investigating the crash and have yet to determine whether it was caused by a mechanical failure, or by the driver falling asleep or suffering an attack.</description>

      <title>IRS scam: College student pays $7,900 to scammers who had her personal information</title>
      <description>HAMDEN, CONNECTICUT &#x2014; A Connecticut college student lost thousands of dollars when she fell for a trap set by thieves posing as the IRS. 


Caissie Davis is a journalism major at Quinnipiac University. Scammers called her using a number that showed up as a local police station. The caller threatened to arrest her if she didn&#x2019;t pay a $2,900 federal student tax, CBS reports.  


That tax does not exist, but Caissie didn&#x2019;t know that. She was terrified and fell for the scam because the caller had all of her personal information. She was told she owed additional fees and was tricked into driving 30 miles to different stores to purchase iTunes and Target gift cards.


All the while, her bank&#x2019;s fraud alert system was sending warnings to her father, who manages her account. He tried desperately to call her but couldn&#x2019;t get through because she was on the phone with the scammers the entire time, making various payments.


In all, Caissie Davis handed over more than $7,900 to the crooks. 


Police said they are unable to identify Caissie&#x2019;s scammers because con artists like these use untraceable payment methods. 


Caissie is telling her story so this won&#x2019;t happen to you.


A spokesperson for the IRS told CBS that the IRS does not call to demand money in a specific form by phone. It does not threaten immediate arrest. And it will never ask for credit card details over the phone.</description>

      <title>Cop saves kid caught on camera: Texas cop performs CPR on boy who stopped breathing</title>
      <description>GRANBURY CITY, TEXAS &#x2014; A Texas cop is being honored this week after he saved the life of a boy who stopped breathing last Wednesday at a KFC parking lot.


Officer Chase Miller was close by when he heard dispatch send out a call for paramedics, so he went to investigate, Texas newspaper the Star-Telegram reported.


Dashcam footage of the incident shows the moment Miller arrives. He is handed the child, named Brayden Geis, by his crying mother. 


The 3-year-old reportedly suffered a seizure due to a high temperature of around 106 degrees Fahrenheit. Brayden stopped breathing and became unresponsive.


The footage shows Miller performing CPR. At one point the officer gets Brayden&#x2019;s dad to help with the process while he retrieves a CPR mask from his car. Miller continued CPR until the boy resumed breathing. 


Brayden was taken to a local hospital where he received treatment and made a full recovery, according to a Tribune Media Wire report on KTLA.com. 


Brayden and his parents this week got to meet and thank Miller at a Granbury City Council meeting, where the officer was presented with a lifesaving award.  


In a funny twist, it turns out Brayden&#x2019;s favorite cartoon character from the television show Paw Patrol, is a dog named Chase. 


So, in a very cool gesture, Miller presented Brayden with a Chase toy. What a guy.</description>

      <title>Public overdose video: Young Ohio mom and boyfriend pass out in car after taking heroin</title>
      <description>TOLEDO, OHIO &#x2014; Shocking new footage has emerged showing the latest victims of America&#x2019;s growing opioid epidemic &#x2014; more and more of whom are overdosing in public.


Ohio mother Haley Kirkendall, 22, and her boyfriend, Taylor Swartzlander, 24, shot up heroin inside their car on Monday, the Toledo Blade reported.


The vehicle was later spotted drifting diagonally across a road in Toledo, moments before it jumped the curb and crashed into a parked car.


Witness Tyler Rieger saw the crash, and thought the driver had suffered an attack or stroke. But upon checking the vehicle, he instead found drug needles, and an unconscious couple who had just overdosed on smack.


Rieger recorded a video of the scene, and shared it on Facebook to warn of the rampant spread of drug addiction in the community. The video has since received more than 290,000 views.


Paramedics who responded to the incident used Narcan to revive the couple. They were taken to the hospital and later released. Both have been charged with drug possession.</description>

      <title>Thailand goes dark: Black is back as country goes into mourning after death of the King</title>
      <description>BANGKOK &#x2014; Things have gone dark in Thailand after the recent death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej last week. 


Thais all over the country have been wearing black, electronic billboards were shut off, and thousands have been crying their eyes out in the streets, Time reported. 


Civil servants have been ordered to wear black for a year, while Thai citizens are urged to for a month. The demand for black clothes is so big, many stores have sold out.


Websites in Thailand have even gone black and white in order to mourn for the King, according to Quartz.


The famed red-light district has been pretty much empty, while shows and entertainment are being toned down. 


As for TV, if you love watching nothing but all King, all day, every day from now until the end of eternity, then head over to Thailand.</description>

      <title>Chain-smoking chimpanzee is North Korean zoo&#x2019;s star attraction</title>
      <description>PYONGYANG, NORTH KOREA &#x2014; A 19-year-old female chimpanzee in North Korea has gained a reputation for a very nasty habit, but it&#x2019;s paying off for her keepers quite handsomely.


Journalists from the Associated Press visited the Central Zoo in Pyongyang on October 19, photographing the smoking ape among many other staged media events put on in the Hermit Kingdom this week.


The chimp, named Azalea, smokes roughly a pack of cigarettes every day. She usually receives them from audience members who came to see her in action. The routine consists of a trainer shouting instructions and making hand gestures at Azalea. She is then thrown a lighter, and she lights the cigarette herself.


Some of the other acts at the zoo include dogs that can do math, and a monkey that can slam dunk a basketball.


In 2014, the great, magical, all-powerful Kim Jong Un ordered an upgrade for the Central Zoo, one of several efforts to erect more stunning, contemporary structures and leisure centers.</description>

      <title>Houston H-Mart abduction: Cameras catch weirdo trying to take baby out of shopping cart</title>
      <description>HOUSTON &#x2014; A weird man tried to abduct a baby at an H-Mart in Houston, Texas earlier this month.


The incident took place on Oct. 15, when mom Florence Monauer was shopping for groceries, while her 14-month-old daughter sat in a shopping cart beside her. 


Surveillance footage shows an unidentified man trying to take the baby girl from the cart while Monauer was not looking.


The baby was sitting in a seat cover strapped to the shopping cart, therefore the man couldn&#x2019;t take her out easily, and Monauer noticed his actions.


Monauer calmly took the baby back, and the man left after tickling the child&#x2019;s tummy.


Houston police are looking at the case as a possible attempted abduction, according to ABC affiliate KTRK. However, the man has not been identified or charged.</description>

      <title>Chinese tourists behaving badly: Chinese couple steal toilet seat from hotel in Japan</title>
      <description>NAGOYA, JAPAN &#x2014; A red-faced Chinese couple apologized this week for stealing an electronic toilet seat from a hotel in Japan.


Travelers identified as Mr. Li and Ms. Chen found the multi-function toilet seat underneath their bed at a hotel in Nagoya on Monday.


In an attempt to keep a lid on the bad press, the sticky-fingered tourists claimed to think the seat was left behind by previous guests, the South China Morning Post reported.
 
The couple from eastern China apologized and sent the toilet seat back when the hotel discovered it was missing and kicked up a stink.


Demand for electronic toilet seats is off the chain in China, and the gadgets have become one of the most popular purchases for Chinese visitors to Japan.</description>

      <title>Female cop holds back from shooting black man on PCP beating her due to fears of backlash</title>
      <description>CHICAGO &#x2014; Chicago police have released body cam footage of an arrest that didn&#x2019;t go smoothly at all, and resulted in serious injuries to a female police officer who was afraid to fire her weapon due to fears of backlash. 


On October 5, 28-year-old Parta Huff was driving and somehow crashed his car into a liquor store. Witnesses say he was out of it. Police report he was high on PCP at the time. Huff wasn&#x2019;t injured in the accident, and decided to just walk away. 


It didn&#x2019;t take long for the cops to catch up to him, and when they did, they tried to put the cuffs on him. When he was resisting arrest, they tried tasing him. As the video shows, Huff didn&#x2019;t respond well to that. 


The female officer that was trying to arrest him eventually gets taken to the ground, and receives several blows to the head. As she was being beaten, she reportedly thought about pulling out her gun, but decided against it fearing she would be criticized for her use of deadly force on a black man.


There were two body cam perspectives released. In the second body cam, as the female cops fellow officers storm in to come to her aid, Huff doesn&#x2019;t release his grip, despite still being tased. After hanging on to her for about five minutes, he finally let go.


The female officer later admitted that she thought she was going to die, but wanted to spare her family and her department from being scrutinized on the national news the next day. She suffered a concussion, bone chips to her shoulder, a neck injury, and had bits of concrete pulled from her face. She is still recovering.</description>

      <title>Man runs over Trump campaign sign then posts video to Facebook and gets arrested</title>
      <description>CAPE CORAL, FLORIDA &#x2014; A man unlikely to vote for Donald Trump decided to let the Internet know how he feels by running over one of his campaign signs. 


The man ran over the sign on October 15. Not only did he drive off the road to knock it down, he also recorded a video of him doing it. He then posted the video to Facebook. 


The Trump supporter whom the sign belonged to did not find the damage very amusing. The sign reportedly has a $275 replacement value, according to police. When the woman saw the video online, she contacted the Cape Coral Police Department.


The man&#x2019;s digital footprint made it amazingly easy for cops to track him down. 36-year-old Manuel Retiz was arrested and now faces charges of Criminal Mischief.</description>

      <title>Chiropractic adjustment gone wrong: Model Katie May&#x2019;s death linked to neck manipulation</title>
      <description>LOS ANGELES &#x2014; An injury incurred during a common chiropractic procedure has been linked to the death of stunning Playboy model and businesswoman Katie May.  


Dubbed the &#x201C;Queen of Snapchat,&#x201D; she died after suffering two strokes in February.


Gossip site TMZ claims to have obtained a copy of her death certificate. Their report states that the Los Angeles County Coroner wrote that May died from an injury sustained during a &#x201C;neck manipulation&#x201D; by a chiropractor. That neck manipulation reportedly tore her left vertebral artery, cutting off blood flow to the brain.


The American Heart Association warns that neck manipulation has been associated with cervical dissection &#x2014; an arterial tear that can result in a stroke.


In the days prior to her death, May had reportedly taken a fall during a Los Angeles photoshoot. The Ohio University graduate complained about neck pain from a pinched nerve she sustained during a photoshoot.


Tweeting about it May wrote: &#x201C;Pinched a nerve in my neck on a Photoshoot and got adjusted this morning.&#x201D;


She&#x2019;d reportedly went to visit a chiropractor twice to try and help with the pain.


According to May&#x2019;s obituary in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, she later began to feel dizzy and experienced numbness in her hands. She called her parents to tell them she was going to pass out.


After going to the hospital May initially seemed alright, but the situation soon turned tragic. The New York Daily News reports that she&#x2019;d suffered two strokes and recovered from the first. The second, however, left her brain dead.


May, a single mother, was 34. Most strokes occur in those 65 and over. She is survived by her 7-year-old daughter Mia.</description>

      <title>Heroes form human chain to rescue man from burning car in Palm Beach, Florida</title>
      <description>PALM BEACH, FLORIDA &#x2014; A crowd of bystanders formed a human chain to rescue a driver from a burning vehicle on Sunday.


The driver was suspended by a seat belt and trapped upside down, with his life hanging in the balance, after he crashed his SUV and went hurtling over a cliff.


Hero bystanders sprung into action to save the driver, with one man bounding down the cliff to release him, NBC affiliate WESH reported.


Police arrived on the scene quickly and joined the passersby to form a human chain, dragging the man to safety. But instead of saying thanks, the guy struggled with the cops, seemingly unaware of how close he came to death.


The driver was taken to the hospital for medical treatment but his condition was unknown.


Some of the officers and bystanders who took part in the rescue mission picked up a few bumps and scrapes, but nothing major, according to police.


It is unknown whether the driver was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or what caused the accident.</description>

      <title>Walking Dead Season 7: Rick and the gang are back, but who did Negan kill?</title>
      <description>New York &#x2014; Your favorite neighborhood zombie apocalypse is finally back with the return of The Walking Dead Season 7. But the question on everyone&#x2019;s mind is: Who the hell did Negan beat to a bloody pulp with Lucille at the end of Season 6?   


When we left Rick and the gang at the end of the last season, Negan was right in the middle of playing a quick game of eenie meenie miney mo. Who was the unlucky winner?


The comic book series has Glenn being taken out by Negan, but we&#x2019;re hoping they can keep the Asian guy around for just a bit longer.


Could it be Maggie? But then what about the baby? 


Michonne, Abraham and Carl most likely don&#x2019;t have anything to worry about &#x2014; yet.    


We&#x2019;re putting our money on Daryl as receiver of Negan&#x2019;s grand slam. Where&#x2019;s a good crossbow when you need it? 


But with AMC announcing a Season 8 this week, looks like the show will be one of the undead for quite some time to come.</description>

      <title>M&amp;M&#x2019;s caramel: New M&amp;M candies filled with gooey caramel to hit shelves in 2017</title>
      <description>MCLEAN, VIRGINIA &#x2014; The candy gods have answered all our prayers, as M&amp;M&#x2019;s unveils a new flavor next year that proves there is still goodness in the world. Chocolatey goodness.


For the first time since the brand was established 75 years ago, the M&amp;M&#x2019;s crew has decided to fill their candies with something soft and gooey for a change, reports CNN Money.


The new M&amp;M&#x2019;s flavor will have a luscious caramel center covered in milk chocolate and encased in the candy&#x2019;s trademark crunchy, colorful shell. 


Unlike pumpkin spice or carrot cake, the new flavor is going to be a permanent item, and the company&#x2019;s gateway to the booming $2.2 billion dollar caramel business.


M&amp;M&#x2019;s have never before been filled with such a soft center, so engineers spent two years perfecting the consistency so that the chocolate would not collapse from being too soft or too sticky. The company also built a new plant in Topeka, Kansas to make the tasty morsels.


The caramel candies are set to hit the shelves by May 2017, according to an M&amp;M&#x2019;s press release.</description>

      <description>GEORGE TOWN, MALAYSIA &#x2014; A 3-year-old is in critical condition after falling from an escalator in Malaysia. 


The unfortunate event occurred around 6:30 p.m. on Sunday at the Bukit Jambul mall in George Town, the capital of the Malaysian state of Penang, Malaysia&#x2019;s Malaysian Digest reported. 


The little girl has been identified Nur Aqilah Amani Zuraimi. The mall&#x2019;s CCTV footage shows that she was riding on her father&#x2019;s shoulders just moments before the accident.

Intensive care staff at the Penang Hospital said the girl suffered a cracked skull and internal bleeding. 


According to Malaysia&#x2019;s News Strait Times, Malaysia&#x2019;s Women, Family and Community Development Minister Rohani Abdul Karim said the father was responsible for the accident.

      <title>Boy, 13, has leg amputated after fight with teacher at school in Columbus, Georgia</title>
      <description>COLUMBUS, GEORGIA &#x2014; A 13-year-old boy is facing life with only one leg following an altercation with a teacher at school.


The boy, identified as Montravious Thomas, was set to go under the knife on Tuesday after a month of treatment failed to save his right leg.


Thomas was enrolled in an alternative school program for kids with behavioral issues at the Edgewood Student Services Center in Columbus, Georgia, when the incident that led to the amputation occurred on September 12.


The boy was reportedly the only student in the class when he decided he wanted to call his mom to pick him up. However, behavioral specialist Bryant Mosley refused to let him go. The teacher then allegedly body-slammed the boy to the floor multiple times.


Lawyers for Thomas said the boy suffered a broken leg, permanent nerve damage, and a damaged knee cap, the Ledger-Enquirer reported.


The teacher then carried the boy to the school bus and sent him home without providing medical aid or telling his family.


Adding insult to injury, Thomas&#x2019;s mother Lawanda lost her temp job because she was spending time at her son&#x2019;s side in the hospital.


Lawyers for the Thomas family plan to file a lawsuit for an amount that&#x2019;s yet to be determined.


Moseley has not been charged with any crime related to the incident. The school has agreed to release more than 50 documents and any available video footage to the boy&#x2019;s legal team.</description>

      <title>Man loses willy after getting it stuck in bottle for 4 days when he used it as a toy</title>
      <description>TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS &#x2014; A 50-year-old man was forced to say goodbye to his manhood after a sexual encounter with a bottle horribly wrong.


The man was reportedly attempting to relieve sexual frustration, as he was absent of the love from a woman, Honduran news site La Prensa reported. He chose to mate with a plastic bottle, but unfortunately, he got stuck. 


It took him four days to finally build up the courage to seek medical help. When he finally did, the doctor told him that as his penis had turned black in color, he would have to have it amputated. He had suffered a condition called necrosis, where the cells in his penis had literally died.


Surgeon Dennis Chirinos managed to perform a delicate operation that would still allow the man to urinate, but said in an interview with HTH Television Digital that it was unlikely the man would ever be able to have sex again.</description>

      <title>Maggots found in KFC meal: Nightmare as mom makes disgusting find in son&#x2019;s fried chicken</title>
      <description>WEST HELENA, ARKANSAS &#x2014; A concerned mother posted a video to YouTube that has since gone viral of her son&#x2019;s KFC fried chicken meal crawling with maggots inside.


The mom claims that on Oct. 2, she took the 5-year-old boy to a KFC in West Helena, Arkansas. Shortly after the meal, the boy began gagging and vomitting, and she rushed him to the hospital for what she thought was a bout of food poisoning.


She must&#x2019;ve held on to the meal, and for good reason. After inspecting it, she noticed little &#x201C;fly eggs&#x201D; inside the meat. By the next day, the eggs had hatched into a full-blown explosion of maggots. 


In response to the mother&#x2019;s claims, KFC released a statement saying it was highly unlikely the contamination happened in their restaurant. The company pointed to the fact a health inspector had come by days earlier and had taken a good look around the location for anything that would be of concern.

KFC also noted that its cooking methods would also make it practically impossible for the eggs to survive the insanely hot temperatures the dead birds are put through.</description>

      <title>Loud love-making: Chinese man gets beaten up by dozens for loud romp in hotel room</title>
      <description>BEIHAI, CHINA &#x2014; CCTV footage has surfaced online showing a furious hotel guest beating up a man in a nearby room for having loud sex in China last Thursday.


According to Chinese news site WXRW123, the attacker, identified by his surname Zhang, was staying at the hotel with his colleagues when they were disturbed by a neighboring couple&#x2019;s lovemaking session.


Unable to sleep and with a business meeting the next day, Zhang decided to have a word with them.


In the CCTV footage, Zhang can be seen knocking on the neighbor&#x2019;s door. Zhang&#x2019;s colleagues join him in the hallway while Zhang and the man, surnamed Lei, exchange words through the door. Zhang kicks the door down, and he and his colleagues rush in.


Lei was beaten and then dragged to the lobby, where the beatdown continued. 


Police arrived and arrested the attackers. Zhang eventually admitted he had overreacted, and had to pay 15,000 yuan (about $2,225) to Lei to settle the dispute.</description>

      <title>Ex-high school basketball coach gets 30 years for molesting female student</title>
      <description>KILN, MISSISSIPPI &#x2014; Leslie Danielle DeWitt was found guilty of coaching a 16-year-old female student on more than just sports, and will soon spend the rest of her life in jail for it.


The Herald Sun reports that the former basketball coach from Hancock High School in Mississippi reportedly lusted after the student since the latter was in middle school, and gave the pupil private basketball lessons.


DeWitt grew close to the student&#x2019;s family over the years. The girl&#x2019;s mother said she often allowed her daughter to sleep over at the house DeWitt shared with her husband and young son. It was during one of these sleepovers that the coach began taking advantage of the student, and allegedly abused her with a sex toy. 


The coach&#x2019;s obsession with her prodigy was apparent, raising concerns from both the girl&#x2019;s friends and school officials, who asked her to cease contact with her pupil. DeWitt later played off the concerns to the student&#x2019;s mother, saying it resulted from &#x201C;internal drama&#x201D; in the basketball program.


It wasn&#x2019;t until years later, when the student was already in college, that she broke down and confessed about the ordeal. Her mother reported the case to the authorities, and DeWitt was put on trial. She was eventually found guilty of two counts of unlawful touching of a child for lustful purposes, and sentenced to 15-years in prison for each count.


The ex-coach will need to serve the entirety of her sentences consecutively, and is not eligible for early release or parole.</description>

      <title>Blonde Oklahoma cheer coach arrested for soothing student&#x2019;s pom-poms with cough drops</title>
      <description>TISHOMINGO, OKLAHOMA &#x2014; A high school cheerleading coach who was arrested and suspended last month for giving some inappropriate extracurricular encouragement to a student is still being paid her teacher&#x2019;s salary.


Investigators say Shelley Duncan, 48, had sexual contact with a 14-year-old boy, even promising to soothe his pom-poms with a cough drop in her mouth, the Daily Caller reported.


In addition to her cheer coach job at Tishomingo High School in Oklahoma, Duncan works as an English teacher at an alternative education high school school in the district. She is also a reserve college police officer and is married to the Tishomingo Public Schools superintendent.


But that didn&#x2019;t stop her from getting sexually involved with the boy, organizing their inappropriate liaisons through Snapchat.


Investigators say Duncan called the boy &#x201C;boo&#x201D; and &#x201C;love&#x201D; and told him &#x201C;U have no idea what u mean to me &#x2026; I&#x2019;m here for the rest of ur life.&#x201D;


She told him it was &#x201C;hot&#x201D; that he loved his mom, before the boy&#x2019;s mother reported the affair to the police.


The boy told the cops about several makeout sessions with Duncan, including kissing her while her daughter slept in the same car.


Duncan&#x2019;s husband Kevin said his wife is eligible to receive her salary despite her suspension, while her criminal case is pending. Reports did not say whether the superintendent had issued his own suspension on his wife for cuckolding him with a kid 34 years her junior.</description>

      <title>Teen goes blind from KCF &amp; Coke: Vitamin A deficiency blinds Australian boy in one eye</title>
      <description>PERTH, AUSTRALIA &#x2014; A teen in Western Australia nearly lost his ability to see thanks to a nutritionally-horrendous diet consisting of only bread, potatoes, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Coke. 


For eight years, 14-year-old Cian Moore supposedly survived on eating potatoes, bread, KFC and Coca-Cola, exclusively. Eventually, he complained to his mother that his eyes had become dry and gritty. He was also having trouble seeing.


His mother took him to see several eye specialists, and eventually they found out Cian&#x2019;s poor diet had led to a severe Vitamin A deficiency. Without Vitamin A, the cells in the eye fail to mature properly, resulting in keratin build-up that manifests as spots on the surface of the eye.


To save his sight, young Cian had to load up on Vitamin A supplements, and eat his vegetables. Now 16, the vision in his right eye has almost completely recovered, but his left eye remains permanently damaged.</description>

      <title>Larnie Thomas arrest: White cops arrest Black man Minnesota for walking on side of street</title>
      <description>EDINA, MINNESOTA &#x2014; Larnie Thomas was walking through a suburban neighborhood in Edina, Minnesota when he was stopped by a plainclothes cop for what appears to be a case of walking while black.


Thomas was walking on the side of the street to avoid construction taking place on the sidewalk. As he was walking, a police squad car pulled up beside him. The police statement alleges Officer Tim Olson tried to get Thomas&#x2019; attention, but couldn&#x2019;t because he was wearing headphones. 


The officer then drove further ahead and blocked the street with his car so Thomas would have to stop, but Thomas just walked around it. Officer Olson claims he followed Thomas on foot to tell him to get out of the lane of traffic, and when he didn&#x2019;t listen, he was grabbed by the jacket.


Video taken of the interaction that followed has gone viral online. The seven-minute clip shows Larnie Thomas removing his own shirt to escape the grip of Officer Olson. The white woman recording the video, Janet Rowles, witnessed the entire incident, and can be heard pleading with the cop to resolve this in another way. She says Larnie Thomas absolutely should not have been stopped.


Once Olson called for backup, another squad car arrived minutes later, and Thomas was arrested. Olson later claimed Thomas smelled of alcohol, and a breathalyzer confirmed there was alcohol in his system. However, his blood-alcohol level has not been reported. Furthermore, the matter of how much alcohol was in his system is not exactly relevant; in Minnesota, public intoxication is not considered a crime. 


Thomas was cited for disorderly conduct and failure to obey a traffic signal. He was detained for 45 minutes before being released.</description>

      <title>Firebomb attack on N. Carolina GOP HQ: Trump blames &#x2018;animals representing Hillary&#x2019;</title>
      <description>HILLSBOROUGH, NORTH CAROLINA &#x2014; Unknown perpetrators burned the Republican Party&#x2019;s North Carolina headquarters to the ground in a diabolical firebomb attack on Saturday night.


An arsonist hurled a bottle of flammable liquid through a window at the GOP headquarters in Orange County, setting the building ablaze, local police said, according to the Charlotte Observer,


North Carolina governor Pat McCrory called the firebombing &#x201C;an attack on democracy,&#x201D; while one GOP official said it was an act of political terrorism.


In addition to the firebomb, graffiti that branded GOP members &#x201C;Nazis&#x201D; and warned them to leave town was daubed on a nearby building.


Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blamed the attack on &#x201C;animals representing Hillary and the Democrats,&#x201D; and tweeted that they did it because they&#x2019;re losing the race to the White House.


GOP volunteers said the attack would backfire because it would make Republicans mad and motivate them to vote.


Hillary Clinton tweeted that the attack was &#x201C;horrific and unacceptable,&#x201D;which makes us here at TomoNews think the Democrat presidential nominee probably wasn&#x2019;t behind it.


So who could have committed such a barbarous act? Well, the fact that this atrocity happened in the Carolinas can only mean one thing.


That&#x2019;s right, North and South Carolina are a hive of creepy clown activity and with Halloween just weeks away, it seems these evil pranksters will stop at nothing in their quest to menace good folks.</description>

      <title>Armed robber shoots 15-yr-old sandwich shop worker in the head in Cleveland Heights</title>
      <description>CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, OHIO &#x2014; A 15-year-old teenager was shot in the head and killed during a robbery last Friday.


Sunny Patel was gunned down when an armed suspect rushed into the Mr. Hero restaurant around 8 p.m. on South Taylor Road in Cleveland Heights, News 5 reported. 


Authorities say the suspect shot the teen once in the head, demanded money and then fled the scene. 


Patel was rushed to University Hospitals where he died around 11 p.m., according to his family. 


Surveillance photos released by officials show the suspect wearing gray sweatpants, a black Nike hoodie, a white bandana over his face and sunglasses. 


Ravi Patel, Patel&#x2019;s father, said Sunny wasn&#x2019;t a worker at the store. He was just helping his aunt and uncle, who own the restaurant, out for the night. 


Patel was only a sophomore at Mayfield Heights High School. 


Police are asking for the public&#x2019;s help in identifying the shooter.</description>

      <title>Asgardia: Russian rocket scientist Igor Ashurbeiyli funding plans for space nation</title>
      <description>SPACE &#x2014; On Oct. 12, the citizens of Earth got one step closer to ditching the planet for a better way of life after a Russian businessman and scientist announced his plan to create humanity&#x2019;s very first space nation, Asgardia.


That is, if you believe Igor Ashurbeyli, chairman of UNESCO's Science of Space committee and founder of the Aerospace International Research Center.


Asgardia is named after Asgard, home of the gods ancient Norse mythology. Asgardia has several philosophical aims, one being to cultivate peace in space, creating a home for humanity free of Earth&#x2019;s conflicts. Another stated purpose of Asgardia is to shield the Earth from space threats, such as asteroids, sun flares and man-made debris. Asgardia will also supposedly be a safe space for scientists to conduct private and unrestricted research, free from the constraint of a land-based country&#x2019;s laws. 


Ashurbeyli and his team would like to offer everyone access to space, regardless of where they come from. All a person has to do is fill out an online application form on the Asgardia website. The form requires only an applicant&#x2019;s name and email, and immediately they become a full-fledged &#x201C;Asgardian.&#x201D; Once at least 100,000 people register to become citizens of Asgardia, Ashurbeyli says it will be eligible to become a member of the United Nations.


So far, the funding of Asgardia is through private, personal financiers. Crowd-sourcing campaigns will also be set up to pursue the project, and early plans are for a satellite to be sent into orbit in October 2017.</description>

      <title>Delta airlines discrimination: Black woman says staff didn&#x2019;t think she was real doctor</title>
      <description>DETROIT &#x2014; A young black female doctor&#x2019;s Facebook post detailing an alleged case of discrimination during a mid-flight medical emergency is setting social media on fire this week.


Tamika Cross claims she was flying to Houston from Detroit via Minneapolis aboard a Delta Airlines flight, when an old man sat two rows in front became &#x201C;unresponsive&#x201D;.
Initially thought by airline staff to be a &#x201C;night terror,&#x201D; the man became unresponsive again and staff asked for help.  


That&#x2019;s when Tamika volunteered to help, but was told by the airline attendant that they required &#x201C;an actual physician.&#x201D; That same Delta attendant reportedly probed her for info, asking for her credentials, about her background and what she was doing in Detroit.


But then a white man claiming to be a doctor volunteered to help, Tamika notes he didn&#x2019;t face the same line of questioning she did.


She was naturally angered, but when the attendant asked for some advice later, Tamika says she still helped them out. Tamika wrote that the airline staff did apologize and tried to offer her free air miles, but she refused.


Delta has responded to the Tamika&#x2019;s claims, saying  discrimination is unacceptable and they&#x2019;re investigating the incident.


Tamika is listed as &#x201C;Tamika Cross, M.D.&#x201D; and as a resident physician on the University of Texas Health Science Center website.</description>

      <title>&#x2018;Stingray Queen&#x2019; Rava Ray dives naked with dangerous marine creatures</title>
      <description>NEW YORK &#x2014; A 27-year-old model is being called the &#x2018;Stingray Queen&#x2019; after sharing stunning photographs of her swimming naked with dangerous marine creatures.


According to Rava Ray&#x2019;s website, she was born in Kentucky and raised in Tahiti. She learnt  to swim with marine creatures in Hawaii.


Ray said she particularly enjoys swimming naked and does not believe it is an animal&#x2019;s first instinct to attack human beings. She shares photos of her swimming with marine animals on Instagram.


Apart from modelling naked with marine creatures, Rava Ray also designs &#x201C;wearable art&#x201D; made of shells and feathers. She is currently studying fashion design in New York.


The most notorious incident involving a stingray took place in 2006. Australian &#x201C;Crocodile Hunter&#x201D; Steve Irwin was swimming behind a stingray when it suddenly stabbed Irwin with its tail, hitting his heart and killing him.</description>

      <title>WikiLeaks dumps a load of Hillary Clinton campaign emails</title>
      <description>WASHINGTON &#x2014; WikiLeaks has recently been dumping thousands of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s campaign, which couldn&#x2019;t come at a worse time for the Dem&#x2019;s presidential candidate. 


The massive trove of emails from campaign chairman John Podesta revealed that Hillary&#x2019;s camp underestimated Bernie Sanders and worried about Joe Biden jumping into the race and Elizabeth Warren endorsing her opponent.  


The emails also show her campaign worked endlessly on managing Clinton&#x2019;s image in the press and had close ties to the Obama administration as well as the higher ups in the Democratic Party who were supposed to remain neutral during her primary battle against Sanders. They also revealed Clinton&#x2019;s close relationships with Wall Street. 


Is the media really in Hillary&#x2019;s corner? Are the WikiLeak dumps a game changer?</description>

      <title>Levi Price&#x2019;s mysterious death: &#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming&#x2019; man Facebook live streams before drowning</title>
      <description>SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA &#x2014; A Facebook Live video by Louisiana man Levi Price is being examined by investigators after the 27-year-old turned up dead shortly after it was streamed online. 


In the video posted on October 11, Price appears to be wandering through a wooded area near a bridge, live streaming for almost two minutes. It&#x2019;s not clear who he&#x2019;s running from, but several commenters on his Facebook wall suspect he was evading police.


Not long after the live stream cut out, a person walking near the bridge called 911 after witnessing a man thrashing about in the water, drowning. Once emergency crews got to the scene, divers were sent in to help. They found Price, floating lifeless, 17 feet below the surface. His body was recovered around 5:15 p.m. The Facebook Live video was streaming at 1:05 p.m.


Levi Price&#x2019;s final remarks during his last moments can only be described as eerie. In a murmered voice, he mentions that he had gone to a motel to visit somebody near a casino, and then says &#x201C;now they&#x2019;re trying to get me, because I was at the casino. I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be there.&#x201D; He then says he didn&#x2019;t do anything wrong, and explains how he was trying to get across the bridge to escape his followers. The video cuts out with him saying &#x201C;They&#x2019;re coming through the woods, now.&#x201D;


A spokesperson for the sheriff&#x2019;s office said that though it appears Price was being followed in the video, there is not yet any evidence to suggest that he was actually being followed.</description>

      <title>Teachers sex: Choir teacher, 25, charged over sex with 16-year-old high school boy</title>
      <description>BOTHELL, WASHINGTON &#x2014; A 25-year-old teacher in Bothell, Washington has been arrested for getting it on with a male student, who was only 16 at the time. 


A choir teacher at Lynnwood High School, Olivia Sondheim engaged in a relationship with a student enrolled in her class that escalated into sexual territory. When the Edmonds School District found out, the Snohomish County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office was alerted. On October 12, police were at Sondheim&#x2019;s door with a search warrant. 


After being placed on leave from her duties, she&#x2019;s since been arrested and is now facing charges of first-degree sexual misconduct with a minor. 


Her crime comes on the heels of a child-sex sting in the same school district reported on September 26, which saw a history teacher and a bus driver arrested for responding to a Craigslist ad set up by detectives posing as a 15-year-old girl online.</description>

      <title>Nude Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt conjoined twin wax statue on eBay going for &#xA3;10,000</title>
      <description>PECKHAM, UNITED KINGDOM &#x2014; Just because Brangelina&#x2019;s calling it quits doesn&#x2019;t mean their iconic union needs to be a thing of the past. A man in South London is selling off a bizarre wax figure of the two to the highest bidder.


This week, eBay seller Barney Marco began auctioning off a one-of-a-kind wax statue of the couple that takes the form of a conjoined twin. The statue is a nude depiction of the two.


The odd masterpiece is crafted from mannequin-grade specialty wax, with glass eyeballs and real human hair. It also stands at only 103 cm tall, about half of life-size. The wax figure is being auctioned off for a minimum of &#xA3;10,000 &#x2013; the seller notes that he will accept no less. The auction ends October 15.


Angelina Jolie filed to separate from Brad Pitt on September 15, 2016, claiming irreconcilable differences. The two actors got together in 2004, married in 2014, and share six kids together.</description>

      <title>Sikh attack in US: Sikh man&#x2019;s hair gets cut during brutal assault in Richmond, California</title>
      <description>RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; Maan Singh Khalsa, a 41-year-old Sikh-American IT worker of Punjabi descent, got the tar beaten out of him by a group of white thugs last month.


A beer can was thrown at his car door by a group of white guys while Singh was driving home in Richmond, California on the night of Sept. 25, according to an open letter to Richmond Police Department from the Sikh Coalition, which is acting on Khalsa&#x2019;s behalf. He tried to question one of them, but the man became aggressive and Khalsa fled.  


Terrified, Khalsa called 911 and told the operator what was going down. However, he soon stopped again at another light, and so did the men from earlier. This time Khalsa had nowhere to run. 


The men knocked his turban off and attacked him repeatedly through the window. To add insult to injury, the wretches severed a fistful of Khalsa&#x2019;s hair.  According to the Sikh Coalition, targeting a Sikh&#x2019;s turban and hair is analogous to targeting a Jew&#x2019;s yarmulke or a Muslim&#x2019;s hijab.


When the light turned green, Khalsa managed to escape, and the 911 operator told him to wait on the cops at a nearby gas station. 


Following the attack, Khalsa received several nasty injuries to his teeth and face. His right pinky is so badly infected, it might need to be amputated. 


The cops last week arrested suspects Chase Little and Dustin Albarado in connection with the incident, but said a third suspect escaped. Little and Albarado were charged with felony assault, but the Sikh Coalition are pushing for them to be charged under California&#x2019;s hate crime laws.</description>

      <title>Father tells son his mom died from heroin overdose, posts video of convo to Facebook</title>
      <description>YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO &#x2014; Sitting across from his 8-year-old son on a sunny day, Ohio man Brenden Bickerstaff-Clark did one of the most heartbreaking things he&#x2019;ll ever have to do as a father &#x2014; tell his boy his mother&#x2019;s dead.


Lacy Wood, the boy&#x2019;s mom, died last month from a heroin overdose city of Warren. She was 29-years-old, reported WFJM-TV.


Brenden didn&#x2019;t tell his son Cameron that their conversation was being filmed, but after getting permission from him to put it online, the footage was posted to Facebook on Tuesday. It&#x2019;s been viewed some 30 million times.


As you&#x2019;d expect, such a powerful father-son moment being shared on social media was both praised and criticized. Brenden said he was &#x201C;iffy&#x201D; about it, but wanted to show the impact drug addiction has on families.</description>

      <title>Hot blonde math teacher from Belarus makes half the world beg to go back to school</title>
      <description>MINSK, BELARUS &#x2014; Viral video of a smoking hot math teacher is giving the internet a stiffy and making us here at TomoNews ask: &#x201C;Where were teachers like this when we were taking AP Calculus?&#x201D;


Stunning blonde Oksana Neveselaya is a math teacher in Minsk, capital of the former Soviet Republic of Belarus.


Video of Oksana was filmed by a student and uploaded to YouTube recently, where it&#x2019;s gotten a golden reception, the Mirror reported.


It&#x2019;s not difficult to see why math might not be the only thing that&#x2019;s hard in her classroom, although anything that motivates kids to go to school surely has to be a good thing.


&#x201C;Oksana love&#x201D; is experiencing exponential growth and her social media accounts have blown up since the video was published.


She&#x2019;s racked up gazillions of new followers, even if most of the guys commenting on her photos seem to be desperadoes declaring undying love. 


We must admit that beauty and brains is an alluring combination and not one that&#x2019;s celebrated much in the superficial times we live in.


Seems like Oksana is currently on holiday in Malaysia, if her Instagram account is anything to go by. Stalker alert!


But for anyone thinking of hopping on the next flight to try and meet the Belarusian beauty, don&#x2019;t get you hopes up. Looks like some lucky guy has already figured out the perfect equation to win her heart.</description>

      <title>Clown craze: Creepy clown caught on tape hitching ride on the back of Detroit bus</title>
      <description>DETROIT, MICHIGAN &#x2014; A video of a creepy clown hitching a ride on the back of a Detroit city bus has gone viral, and the city&#x2019;s transportation department is not amused.


The footage was captured by the dashcam of an unidentified driver, who probably never expect to see a clown clinging to the back of a bus &#x2014; even in Detroit.


The Detroit Department of Transportation has forwarded the video to the police, who are investigating.
The motivation and the identity of the clown remains unclear, according to UPI, one YouTube commenter noted that the costume is similar one seen in a video posted by Instagram prankster @g_dulla_mulla. 


That video ends with the prankster dressed in a clown suit and clinging onto the back of a Detroit city bus. Unfortunately, the video was removed from Instagram on Tuesday morning and the account appears to have been closed.</description>

      <title>Facebook deactivates a mom&#x2019;s account after she posted a tandem breastfeeding photo</title>
      <description>LEBANON, MISSOURI &#x2014; A mother of five has become a celebrity of sorts in the breastfeeding/mom community on Facebook when her account was deactivated because she posted photos of herself breastfeeding two babies at the same time.


Rebecca Wanosik from Lebanon, Missouri, shared two photos of herself breastfeeding her daughter and another baby on Facebook, hoping to empower mothers. In the post she explained that she received a text from a friend asking if she would mind breastfeeding a stranger&#x2019;s baby. The baby&#x2019;s mother, who exclusively breastfed, was having surgery and the baby was refusing the bottle. 


&#x201C;When the baby arrived you could tell she was hungry and refused the bottle,&#x201D; Wanosik wrote. &#x201C;I did what I hope any person would do for my child in a time of despair. I fed a strangers baby.&#x201D;


The photo was featured on Breastfeeding Mama Talks page and garnered tremendous support.


But some critics were concerned that the mothers were being irresponsible, saying that Hep B and HIV could have spread to the child. It isn&#x2019;t known whether Wanosik actually suffers from either one of these disease.


Ultimately, Facebook decided the photo was inappropriate and deactivated Wanosik&#x2019;s account. Her husband came to her defense, and publicized the takedown on Breastfeeding Mama Talks page. 


Wanosik apparently won this battle, as her account was reinstated, and she continues to defend her tandem breastfeeding moment.


Wanosik and her husband have four other children through marriage. Their daughter, one of the babies in the photo, is their first child together.


But this isn&#x2019;t the first time the mom made headlines. Last year, all five of Wanosik&#x2019;s children were taken and placed in foster care after authorities found the youngest, the baby girl, had suffered a broken arm and three fractured ribs. Worried about abuse within the home, all five children were taken away.


A doctor later found that the baby&#x2019;s bones were too brittle due to a vitamin D deficiency. According to the CDC, breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate intake of vitamin D. 


All children were ultimately returned to Wanosik&#x2019;s custody.</description>

      <title>Vietnamese guy snaps private organ during intimate entanglement, gets surgery for injury</title>
      <description>HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM &#x2014;  A 59-year-old Vietnamese man is lucky to have his Johnson in one piece after reportedly snapping it mid-coistus last month.


The guy went to the hospital in Ho Chi Minh City on Sept. 25 after trying out various &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; boinking positions, 


Whatever the Vietnamese buck was doing, it broke his phallus and he had to go to the hospital to get it repaired.


The man&#x2019;s doctor told a local newspaper that such injuries do occur while male sexual organs are standing at attention.


Speaking to TuoiTreNews, the good doctor said, &#x201C;The case of this 59-year-old patient is rare, occurring only once out of a thousand cases of broken penises recorded in medical literature.&#x201D;</description>

      <title>Creepy clowns: Couple of clowns charged with child neglect for leaving kid unattended</title>
      <description>MENASHA, WISCONSIN &#x2014; A Wisconsin couple who left their 4-year-old kid unattended to go creepy clown prankin&#x2019; have been charged with child neglect.


Menasha City Police responded to 911 calls about a pair of clowns causing mischief by the roadside in the early hours of Oct. 7, according to a news release on the department&#x2019;s official Facebook page.


Cops said a 29-year-old man and his 20-year-old male accomplice wore clown costumes and chased after vehicles. A 26-year-old woman was found in a vehicle parked nearby. She and the older clown have a 4-year-old child together.


The kid was left home alone while the pranksters climbed aboard the creepy clown bandwagon. According to cops, the child was left unattended for at least a few hours during the incident.


The kid was taken into care and the parents were booked to appear in court on charges of child neglect.


The 20-year-old man wasn&#x2019;t charged and no charges were made in relation to the creepy clown prankin&#x2019;.</description>

      <description>BARAUT, INDIA &#x2014; A 16-year-old student from India was completely scalped after her hair got caught in a ferris wheel while attempting to take a selfie. 


The horrific accident happened outside of a college in the city of Baraut, located 40 miles north of Delhi.  


It looks as if the teenager was standing close to the ride in order to get a picture, when her hair got stuck in the ferris wheel, the Indian Express reported.  


The ride then ended up ripping off all of the girl&#x2019;s hair, along with her scalp. 


The graphic aftermath was captured on video. It shows a friend talking to the teenager while people around her attempt to get her hair loose, according to the Indian Express.


The girl was eventually freed and taken to a medical facility for treatment, the Indian Express reported.</description>

      <title>Abu Sin: Saudi teen jailed for YouNow video-chatting American vlogger Christina Crockett</title>
      <description>SAUDI ARABIA &#x2014; A teenager from Saudi Arabia has landed himself behind bars for flirting with the forbidden fruit. A series of video chats between the young man and a blonde girl from California have breached Sharia law and the country&#x2019;s internet regulations. 


For weeks, the Arabic-speaking teen known as Abu Sin had been video chatting with 21-year-old Christina Crockett. The two seemed to be having a good time getting to know each other, even though they didn&#x2019;t speak the same language. In the videos, they would frequently tell each other &#x201C;I love you&#x201D; and exchange heart-shaped hand gestures.


Their bond caught the attention of the Internet when the video chats were re-posted to YouTube, but unfortunately for Abu Sin, the police were none too pleased. They arrested him for &#x201C;unethical behaviour&#x201D; claiming the &#x201C;enticing&#x201D; videos made Saudi Arabia look bad in the eyes of the world. 


The 19-year-old was placed in jail for ten days, but has since been released on bond. On October 9, he made a video repenting for his sinful ways, but could still be facing a five-year prison sentence and a fine of $800,000.</description>

      <title>Warriena Wright death: What happened the night she spent with Gable Tostee</title>
      <description>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA &#x2014; It&#x2019;s been over two years since then 26-year-old Warriena Tagpuno Wright fell to her death from the 14th floor of an apartment building in Queensland, Australia. This week, the man accused of causing her fall, Gable Tostee, is in court.


Tostee has pleaded not guilty to the alleged homicide that occurred in August 2014. The now 30-year-old was living in the Avalon Apartments, a high-rise building off the Gold Coast in Surfers Paradise at the time of the incident.


According to investigations conducted by the Queensland Police Service, on Aug. 1, Tostee and Wright, from New Zealand, connected on Tinder. Tostee and Wright, who was on a two-week vacation in the area, decided to meet a week later. The pair bought beer from a local shop then went to Tostee&#x2019;s 14th floor apartment. 


A recording from Tostee&#x2019;s phone gave hints as to what happened that night. It revealed the pair had a fight, during which Tostee accused Wright of being abusive and telling her to stop &#x201C;beating him up&#x201D; and that she is not his &#x201C;kind of girl.&#x201D; He at one point said, &#x201C;You are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony you goddamn psycho little bitch.&#x201D;


A struggle ensues and then Tostee tells Wright that he is kicking her out saying, &#x201C;You have to leave.&#x201D;


Sounds of a door can be heard when Tostee locks Wright out on the balcony. Wright could be heard saying, &#x201C;No,&#x201D; multiple times. Tostee asks her why she tried to hit him with something. Then Wright could be heard begging for Tostee to let her go home. A faint scream can be heard before Tostee says, &#x201C;Sh*t.&#x201D; Afterward, no other recording of Wright could be heard.


Tostee is heard leaving the apartment and calling his father. He tells him, &#x201C;I met up with a girl for a date ... she started getting really aggressive. We had sex in bed and then after that she kept drinking.&#x201D; 


He continues saying, &#x201C;I think she might&#x2019;ve jumped off ... there&#x2019;s like a million cops. I&#x2019;m fucked, I don&#x2019;t know what to do. I didn&#x2019;t cause this, I didn&#x2019;t push her or anything.&#x201D;
When police arrive on the scene, Tostee&#x2019;s apartment is vacant. Tostee was later contacted and interviewed by police, and subsequently arrested. 


During the trial, prosecutors argued that Wright had no choice but to jump in order to escape Tostee, while defense attorneys said that Tostee was in his right to defend himself against the woman.


Of the three hours of audio taken from Tostee&#x2019;s phone, the court heard only one hour. The trail is expected to take place over seven to eight days.</description>

      <title>Creepy clowns: British police warn public as sinister craze spreads across the pond</title>
      <description>LONDON &#x2014; Creepy clowns are giving terrified Brits the spooks, as hundreds of sightings are reported across England, Scotland and Wales.  


With Halloween fast approaching, the creepy clown phenomenon is shaping up to be the most frightful export since Spam to cross the Atlantic.


Just last Sunday, a mother from Manchester reported that she and her two young daughters were menaced by a pair of creepy clowns, the Sun reported.


One of the sinister-looking pranksters jumped on the woman&#x2019;s car and brandished a machete, although the weapon may have been fake. Meanwhile, the clown&#x2019;s partner in creepiness put the willies up the two young girls.


Police forces across the UK have warned the public about the threat from creepy clowns, who appear to have been inspired by a craze that began in the U.S. in late summer.


Although most reports UK police have received are about clowns lurking, or jumping out in front of people more serious complaints have included a knife-wielding clown chasing children in Newcastle, and the robbery of a teenage girl by a clown in Gloucester, according to the Daily Mail.


Meanwhile, an eight-months pregnant woman from Leicester claimed she went into labour prematurely when she was startled by a creepy clown. Thankfully, reports say both mother and baby were doing well.


Dressing up as a clown isn&#x2019;t a criminal offense in the UK, but creepy clowns face a 1,000-pound fine if found guilty of causing alarm and distress, Russia Today reported. And if they&#x2019;re carrying a weapon they could even face jail time.


But with Halloween still a few weeks away, we&#x2019;re guessing that all this clowning around is only just getting started.</description>

      <title>Kidnapped 4-year-old Florida girl found safe in Memphis after frantic five-state search</title>
      <description>MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE &#x2014; A 4-year-old Florida girl was found safe and her kidnapper arrested in Tennessee on Monday after a search that spanned five states, authorities said. 


Rebecca Lewis was discovered in Memphis, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation confirmed over Twitter. 


Authorities say 31-year-old West Wild Hogs, a family friend, kidnapped Rebecca on Saturday morning, Fox 13 reported.  


Amber Alerts for the Lewis were issued in five states: Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee, according to the New York Daily News. 


The pair was spotted at a BP gas station on surveillance cameras in Forsyth, Georgia on Saturday night, then later by a park ranger in Tennessee, according to Fox 13. 


The two were then spotted again in Nashville at 2:28 a.m. on Monday, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told reporters. 


Hogs was pulled over while driving a 2012 gray Nissan with Alabama plates, the New York Daily News reported. 


The 4-year-old was first reported missing when her older sister woke up and couldn&#x2019;t find Rebecca. Hogs had come to the family&#x2019;s home prior to the kidnapping, officials said. 


According to Luther Lewis, the girl&#x2019;s father, Hogs underwent brain surgery several years ago and hadn&#x2019;t been the same since, Fox 13 reported. 


Sheriff Judd described Hogs as a bipolar truck driver who suffers from depression and who was unemployed for at least one to two years, according to Fox 13.</description>

      <title>Vince Staples controversy: Christian mom&#x2019;s rant against explicit rap song goes viral</title>
      <description>NORFSIDE LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; An angry Christian woman&#x2019;s tearful 11-minute-long rant about a rap song has exploded on the internet, with the video racking up more than a million views.  


The unidentified mom of four recorded her tirade after hearing a track called &#x201C;Norf Norf&#x201D; by rapper Vince Staples on the radio. It can be seen in full on the YouTube channel, Twoevils lesser.


The lady cries as she laments that music is not like in her day when wholesome acts such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC topped the charts.


The woman was upset in particular by the song&#x2019;s explicit lyrics, fearing they could have a bad influence on her four young daughters.


The lady wasn&#x2019;t happy about Staples cussing on the track, in which he rhymes that he &#x201C;Ain't never ran from nothin' but the police.&#x201D; Meanwhile, the suggestion by Staples that &#x201C;folks need Porsches and hoes need abortions&#x201D; brought the poor woman to tears.


The Conservative lady said that we need to pray for our youth after hearing Staples&#x2019; line that &#x201C;school was no fun&#x201D; because he couldn&#x2019;t bring his gun. Her reaction was just as negative to Staples spitting about shooting someone five times with an AK-47, thereby ending the homie in question&#x2019;s life.


Staples moved to defuse the situation on Thursday, telling the haters to go easy on the lady.


The rapper told the Independent that he understood the woman&#x2019;s viewpoint and argued that it wasn&#x2019;t right to attack her.


Staples later tweeted that even though the woman appeared emotionally unstable, she had a right to her opinion. So we should all stop asking him about it, OK?!</description>

      <title>Aaron Smith airport toilet: All Black rugby star caught in toilet with hot woman</title>
      <description>CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND &#x2014; Kiwi rugby player Aaron Smith is embroiled in a sex scandal after details emerged of an encounter he had last month with a woman in disabled restroom.


A Kiwi family reportedly saw an attractive woman &#x2014; whom we&#x2019;re guessing was a Kiwi chick &#x2014; entering a bathroom in Christchurch airport, followed shortly after by Smith.
That family told Stuff.co.nz that they heard &#x201C;rhythmic tapping noises&#x201D; coming from the cubicle. 


Reports suggest that the All Blacks scrum-half and his lady friend were probably bonking. And that&#x2019;s not cool, because Smith&#x2019;s actually got a girlfriend. Earlier this week he got on TV and made a tearful apology to her after the story broke.


He was in South Africa this week to play rugby. However, the All Blacks handed him a one-game suspension for his antics and Smith&#x2019;s returning home to handle the situation.</description>

      <title>Teen sexting: Girl, 14, facing sexual exploitation charges for sending sexy pic to boy</title>
      <description>KNOXVILLE, IOWA &#x2014; A 14-year-old girl in Marion County is facing the wrath of a flawed judicial system for sending a couple of seductive selfies to a boy at her school.


Earlier this year the student, referred to as Nancy Doe in court documents, took two photos of herself -- one of her in a sports bra and shorts, and the other also in shorts, with her hair covering her breasts. She sent the pictures to a boy at school using SnapChat, and before long, other students at the school got to see this other side of the young Nancy Doe.


The situation escalated in March, when two male students were caught using the school printers for non-scholastic material. A school official found them with printed copies of photos of male and female students, some of which were nude, with emojis covering their private parts. Nancy Doe&#x2019;s pics were part of that collection, and school officials then contacted Nancy&#x2019;s parents to let them know what her daughter had done. Her parents were told the photos were &#x201C;inappropriate.&#x201D; They confronted her that day, and restricted her phone access, deleting her messaging apps. 


The county attorney tried to have Nancy Doe charged with sexual exploitation of a minor and child pornography, unless she agreed to be part of a diversion program where she admits fault, and is told how she could be forced to register as a sex offender. 30 of Nancy&#x2019;s classmates were threatened with charges of possessing child pornography unless they submitted to participate in the diversion program. 


Her classmates all agreed to the diversion program. Nancy&#x2019;s parents did not, as they don&#x2019;t feel the photos constituted as child pornography. Instead, they are now suing the county prosecutor.</description>

      <title>Police brutality: Dashcam video shows Connecticut cop stomping on cuffed suspect</title>
      <description>HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT &#x2014; Hartford police have released footage showing officers&#x2019; use of excessive force on two suspects, who were caught following a dangerous car chase that involved 31 cops.


Police went after Ricardo Perez and Emilio Diaz after spotting them in a stolen Toyota Camry on the night of June 4, reports the Hartford-Courant. The driver crashed into several vehicles, and led the cops on a long pursuit.


Officers eventually deployed stop sticks to disable the car, and used their cruisers to box the vehicle in.


NBC Connecticut reports that Perez struggled with police. He was tasered by an officer, but when it didn&#x2019;t affect him, he was punched by another in the torso. Diaz was likewise beaten up. In the video, he is seen being kicked and hit at least twice with a baton.


After Diaz was handcuffed and dragged to a nearby tree, dashcam footage shows plainclothes officer Sean Spell approaching him. When the suspect lifts his head off the ground, Spell can be seen violently stomping him on the head.


Police found marijuana and PCP in the car. Diaz himself admitted he was under the influence at the time, but claims he was trying to comply with police, and had no idea the car was stolen.


Both men have pending charges related to the car chase and drug possession. Perez has been charged with reckless driving, engaging police in pursuit, driving without a license, and drug possession. Diaz was charged with interfering with an officer, marijuana possession, and possession with intent to sell. Both men pleaded not guilty.


Meanwhile, an investigation has been opened to look into Spell&#x2019;s actions, as well as how the entire incident came to be.</description>

      <title>Human tail: Indian teen gets 8-inch long vestigial tail chopped off by doctors</title>
      <description>NAGPUR, INDIA &#x2014; A boy in India secretly lived with an 8-inch-long tail growing from his back, which doctors say is the longest ever recorded.


The Times of India reports that the boy&#x2019;s parents knew about the growth, but feared social stigma and kept it hidden. It was only when the fleshy tail became painful that they finally sought a doctor in Nagpur.


Human tails typically result from a compression at the tail end of the back, and grow with age. If unchecked, they can lead to problems in the bladder and lower limbs.


At age 18, the boy&#x2019;s 8-inch-long tail had developed a bone inside it and rendered him unable to sleep or sit properly.


Neurosurgeons successfully removed the tail, finally relieving the boy of his extreme pain and discomfort.


Similar cases of human tails have been reported in India, though the growth tends to be a rare occurrence.


A boy in Punjab was worshipped as the reincarnation of a Hindu monkey god because of the tail protruding from his back. The 14-year-old was born with the tail, along with a clubfoot deformity, and had trouble walking, reports The Daily Mirror.


He opted to have his tail removed last year, despite knowing he&#x2019;d lose his monkey god status.</description>

      <title>German webcam entertainer fights against zoning laws for right to work from home</title>
      <description>AMPFING, GERMANY &#x2014; A German porn star will argue in court this week that stripping in front of a webcam counts as working from home.


Natalie Hot, 24, is defending her right to work as a webcam girl from her house in a the small Bavarian town of Ampfing after neighbors complained that her chosen profession contravenes zoning laws that ban commercial use of a residential property.


Some neighbors complained Hot was too noisy and that their children were teased at school for living near a porn star, the Local reported.


So local authorities slapped Hot with a ban. If she fails to win in court, she&#x2019;ll face a 2,000-euro fine the next time she strips.


Hot claims that her front door was broken by angry neighbors, who have also signed a petition against her.


Local authorities previously ruled that being a webcam girl doesn&#x2019;t qualify as remote work because the spare bedroom used by Hot is an independent commercial unit.


So now it&#x2019;s up to a judge to decide if the bedroom counts as a home office, which would allow Hot to carry on gettin&#x2019; her freak on in front of the camera.</description>

      <title>Joshua Wong barred from Thailand: China begs Thailand to stop HK activist entering</title>
      <description>BANGKOK &#x2014; Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was refused entry into Thailand this week after the country caved into pressure from China. 


Wong was detained at Suvarnabhumi Airport on Tuesday night after Thai officials received a request from the Chinese. 


Wong was scheduled to give a talk on political activism at Chulalongkorn University, according to the Independent. 


China&#x2019;s Foreign Ministry said in a short statement it was aware of the reports and respected Thailand&#x2019;s immigration control, although it didn&#x2019;t say if China had requested Wong be detained. 


After arriving back in Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon, Wong described how he was forced to spend 12 hours inside a cell at the airport, the Guardian reported. 


&#x201C;For almost 12 hours I was detained alone inside a cell,&#x201D; Wong told the press. &#x201C;When I asked what the reason for them detaining me &#x2026; they just said: &#x2018;We will not give you any explanation. You have been blacklisted already.&#x2019;&#x201D; 


The soon to be 20-year-old landed back into Hong Kong around 3:40 p.m. on Wednesday. 


Deputy commander of the Suvarnabhumi immigration office Pruthipong Prayoonsiri told Thailand&#x2019;s the Nation newspaper that China had sent a request for the activist&#x2019;s entry to be denied. 


&#x201C;As a result, the immigration bureau blacklisted him and held him for deportation. When officer informed him, Joshua Wong did not oppose it,&#x201D; Prayoonsiri said.</description>

      <title>Adult video star Tasha Reign fights condom law on California film sets</title>
      <description>LOS ANGELES &#x2014; Several adult film stars in California are campaigning against Proposition 60, a bill that would require all male adult performers to wear condoms on film sets. 


Proposition 60 will be voted on during the November 8 election. In addition to condoms, signs indicating the mandatory use of condoms would also have to be placed on set. erotica producers will also have to pay for the actors&#x2019; STI tests and vaccinations, and they will also have to obtain a license to make their films.


Tasha Reign has been making the rounds at university campuses to tell voters how the bill will impact the actors and the industry as a whole. She&#x2019;s against it because she feels actors shouldn&#x2019;t be forced to put things in their bodies. Tasha says condoms can cause painful and uncomfortable rashes which can lead to health risks like yeast and bacterial infections. 


Tasha Reign worries if the bill is passed, all these changes may push adult film production out of California, which would cost the state millions in losses.</description>

      <title>Autobahn sex: Austria shuts down freeway rest areas with reputation for adult encounters</title>
      <description>LINZ, AUSTRIA &#x2014; Two freeway rest areas, flagged as sex hot spots, have been closed in Austria.


The rest areas on opposite sides of the M&#xFC;hlkreis Autobahn (A7) near Franzosenhausweg in Linz were closed in July after officials at the freeway management company said the restroom areas were frequently vandalized. The Asfinag company cited littering and destruction to partitioning walls between stalls, according to Austrian news website Nachrichten.at.


Police said most of the vandalism occurred at night and that constant repairs made it too expensive to keep the facilities open.


The stops have become popular sexual meeting grounds for both hetero- and homosexual encounters. The rest areas have also been featured on multiple online forums as sex hot spots.</description>

      <title>Elon Musk called out by Vice for not following any women on Twitter</title>
      <description>LOS ANGELES &#x2014; Despite focusing his efforts on revolutionizing transport and colonizing Mars, tech mogul Elon Musk has been called out for not following any female users on his Twitter account.


On Tuesday, Vice&#x2019;s tech website Motherboard revealed that Musk follows 56 accounts, 21 of which are male users, while the rest are brands or publications. In response to Motherboard&#x2019;s tweet publicizing its findings, Musk defended himself by saying he uses Twitter for news and follows as many women as men on Instagram.


Other tech giants should probably have their guard up. 


According to a Guardian analysis of the Twitter accounts of tech&#x2019;s biggest players, the worst offender appears to be Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who follows 267 accounts, including 238 men and 21 women. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella followed the most women, 39 accounts out of a total of 163, which includes 78 men.


Apple CEO Tim Cook follows 51 accounts, including 20 men and four women. Microsoft founder Bill Gates follows 169 accounts, including 57 men and 12 women.


Shortly after the article came out, Elon Musk went ahead and started following Caity Weaver of GQ Magazine.</description>

      <description>OTTAWA, CANADA &#x2014; Video of a massive brawl inside a McDonald&#x2019;s has resurfaced online after someone caught a glimpse of a baby raccoon being taken out during the scrap. 


The brawl took place on Rideau Street in Ottawa back in December 2014, and the video was initially posted to YouTube. 


This week, a GIF of the melee is going viral on social media. It focuses on the moment an old man pulls the raccoon out of his sweater while violent chaos breaks out all around him.

      <title>Wikileaks fails to deliver &#x2018;October Surprise&#x2019;, though Assange says more to come</title>
      <description>BERLIN &#x2014; WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke in a much-anticipated video stream at WikiLeaks 10th anniversary news conference on Tuesday morning, after cancelling a speech from the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London due to fears for personal safety.


And what a tease he was.


The world had been waiting for WikiLeaks&#x2019; so-called &#x201C;October Surprise,&#x201D; which Assange had been hinting was game-changing information that would ruin Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s campaign. However, Assange did not release any new information in his speech &#x2014; other than to promise the release of more information regarding the presidential election every week for the next 10 weeks.


He also denied that he was targeting Clinton with his leaks and said some of his statements had been &#x201C;misconstrued.&#x201D;


Assange added that WikiLeaks will publish documents on war, oil, Google, mass surveillance and U.S. election.


At one point during his speech, Assange said, &#x201C;If we are going to make a major publication about the U.S., we wouldn't do it at 3 a.m.,&#x201D; referring to the time on the U.S. East Coast. No doubt he was anticipating the social media flogging he was about to receive from sleep-deprived Clinton haters who had stayed up late for his not-so-surprising &#x201C;October Surprise.&#x201D; 


Alex Jones of Infowars tweeted that he had been &#x201C;wikirolled.&#x201D;


&#x201C;Julian Assange trolling the world is Hillary&#x2019;s October surprise,&#x201D; Jones said on his show later on Tuesday. &#x201C;He was promising this damning evidence and he doesn&#x2019;t release it now 34 days out and now he&#x2019;s saying he&#x2019;ll release it by the end of the year so that smacks of a sellout ... I think he&#x2019;s probably out of documents.&#x201D;</description>

      <title>Unlikely animal friendships: butterfly lands on baby koala&#x2019;s nose, Internet goes wild</title>
      <description>HELENSBURGH, AUSTRALIA &#x2014; In one of the most unlikely animal friendships seen online, the pairing of a koala joey and a monarch butterfly is melting hearts across the Internet.


The baby koala, Willow, is almost a year old and resides at Symbio Wildlife park in Helensburgh, Australia. During a photoshoot the park was filming for its sustainability initiatives, little Willow caught sight of a beautiful orange butterfly perched on a flower nearby. 


As Willow leaned in for a sniff, the butterfly flew up above her head and landed right on her little nose. Within seconds, the two appeared to be fascinated by one another, enjoying the moment. 


Symbio Wildlife Park is hoping the new friendship caught on video will attract more attention to the work the park is doing to help preserve nature and its amazing creatures. Since being posted to Facebook only two days ago, the video has racked up more than 6 million views. 

Willow is one of seven koalas living at the park located south of Sydney.</description>

      <title>Creepy clowns: Louisiana teens arrested for wearing clown mask amid U.S. clown terror</title>
      <description>RACELAND, LOUISIANA &#x2014; Two high school pranksters were arrested for wearing a clown mask on Tuesday as the clown panic frenzy gripping the nation hit dizzying new levels of hysteria. 


The two 17-year-old students felt the long arm of Louisiana law after they took turns wearing the mask while driving around Central Lafourche High School in Raceland, ABC affiliate KATC reported.  


Students Jordan Boudreaux and Taylor Defelice were charged with breaking a state law that bans the wearing of a mask in public outside of certain holidays.


Probably fearing for their lives, other students reported the pair of jokers for the heinous crime. The two boys were charged with one count each for wearing a mask in public. 


Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig Webre said the cops had already issued a warning that &#x201C;creepy clown&#x201D; activity would not be tolerated, adding that criminal charges would be laid against any jesters who &#x201C;terrorize&#x201D; the community.


Seems like clown hysteria will reach new heights over the coming weeks in the lead up to Halloween. Some costume stores report a 300 percent rise in the sale of clown masks as jokesters ride the wave of creepy clown headlines, Fox 8 reported.


Sure, clowns may look a bit unsettling, but there&#x2019;s nothing to be scared of about a couple of kids wearing a mask.


The ability of so-called creepy clowns to terrorize us is a result of our own willingness to invest in our fears. Maybe it&#x2019;s time for everyone to calm down and see all this clowning around for the harmless joke it really is.</description>

      <title>Deadly police shooting: Bodycam shows Kingman, Arizona cops shooting armed suspect dead</title>
      <description>KINGMAN, ARIZONA &#x2014; A police department in Arizona has released bodycam footage from a deadly encounter that killed one and injured another.


The video was posted on the Kingman Police Department&#x2019;s Facebook page along with a press release.


According to the press release, officers went to a local residence on Thursday to serve a search warrant for a stolen weapon. Inside the house, suspect Jeffrey Clair Cave was alone but armed.


The footage shows police repeatedly banging on the door and eventually pushing it open to reveal Cave standing inside holding a weapon. Police are heard screaming for Cave to drop the gun in his right hand, which was pointed at the floor. Cave doesn&#x2019;t do as they ask and even dares them to shoot him.


After more attempts to get the suspect to stand down, one officer finally fires a Taser. Cave immediately raises his gun in response and shoots it twice before being gunned down by police.


Cave died in the encounter, while one officer, 57-year-old Dennis Gilbert, received a bullet wound to the chest. Cave&#x2019;s other bullet hit another cop, passing through his clothes but luckily not injuring him.


An outside agency, the Bullhead City Police Department, is investigating the shooting.


Officer Gilbert and another officer, 27-year-old Nicholas Schmitz, were the ones who fired at Cave. They have been put on paid administrative leave as part of protocol.</description>

      <title>Pro Call of Duty gamer PHiZZURP tragically killed in Colorado car crash</title>
      <description>AURORA, COLORADO &#x2014; Hours after concluding his final live stream, pro-gamer Phillip Klemenov was gone &#x2014; dead from the same terrible accident that also took the life of his best friend.


The Denver Post reports that the gamer, known online as PHiZZURP, died in an early morning car crash in Aurora, Colorado on Sunday. Klemenov reportedly lost control of the black Infiniti he was driving, which caused the vehicle to flip over and crash into a light pole and several trees.


The sole survivor of the crash was girlfriend Adrianna Lemus, who took to Twitter to recount what happened. According to Lemus, she, Klemenov, and his best friend Marcelo had left a downtown nightclub in the Infiniti, and were minutes away from home when the accident occurred.


Klemenov&#x2019;s best friend Marcelo died at the scene. Lemus, the only conscious passenger, managed to crawl out of the car, and attempted to pull the gamer&#x2019;s unconscious body from the wreckage. He was brought to the hospital in critical condition, and later died.


She claims the gamer had been completely sober, though investigators believe alcohol or drugs may have been a factor in the accident.</description>

      <title>Grizzly bear attack: Bear snaps hiker&#x2019;s arm - he then walks 3 miles to his car</title>
      <description>MADISON VALLEY, MONTANA &#x2014; A grizzly bear attack in Bear Creek almost killed a man. Somehow, he miraculously survived, walked three miles and drove himself nearly 20 more miles to the nearest hospital. 


Todd Orr says he was walking along a hiking trail scouting for elk when he spotted a mother grizzly bear and her two cubs. When the mother charged at Todd, he tried hitting her with bear spray from 25 feet away, but she ran through the mist and took him to the ground. 


He tried to lay as motionless as possible while the bear had her way with him, biting him on the shoulders, arms and backpack. At some point she must&#x2019;ve got bored and left, so Todd tried to get to his car. 


About 10 minutes later, the bear returned for another attack. This time, she bit him so hard on his forearm, it cracked the bone. Surprisingly, after a few more bites, the crazed sow gave pause and walked away. 


Stunned, Todd got up, thanked God and made a video of his account, which he later posted to Facebook. The video has accumulated more than 30 million views in less than two days. After driving himself 17 miles to the hospital, it took them eight hours to stitch Todd back together. Fortunately, he&#x2019;s expected to make a full recovery.</description>

      <title>Chelcie Vera Cookson: personal trainer vows to save homeless man with gym membership</title>
      <description>SYDNEY &#x2014; A persistent personal trainer published a video to Facebook telling the world of how she&#x2019;d planned to change the life of a homeless man. In response, the Internet is flaming her for forcing her &#x201C;goodness&#x201D; on the man and her attempt at humblebragging about it.


In the six-minute video, Chelcie Vera Cookson told the story of how she was leaving her volunteer shift at a homeless food shelter when she noticed the homeless man, Steven, sitting outside. She asked him how he ended up on the streets and what he was doing to get off them. Steven just wanted to be left alone, but Chelcie was determined to figure out how to help this hapless soul. 


After going home to meditate, she realized &#x201C;exercise&#x201D; was what was going to dig him out of the rut of his life. Thrilled with her epiphany, she went looking for Steven to tell him how she was going to turn his life around.


When she did tell Steven, he turned her down five times, saying he was overweight and tired. But the poor guy was no match for the modern day self-anointed saint named Chelcie, who is hellbent on taking Steven to the gym this week. 


The top comment on Chelcie&#x2019;s Facebook wall was by user Jim Paris, who wrote, &#x201C;Looks like a self licking ice cream after her 5 seconds of fame. The gym isn&#x2019;t going to put food in his belly. Is business a bit slow??&#x201D;</description>

      <title>Robot fellatio cafe to open in London</title>
      <description>LONDON &#x2014; Sex industry entrepreneur Bradley Charvet has planned to open a sex robot cafe in Paddington, London, to provide fellatio to customers while enjoying their coffee.


Customers at the Fellatio cafe will choose their robot and coffee from an iPad. Each robot has four different outfits: nurse, police, student and secretary.


A waitress will serve the coffee to the customer while the robot will perform the job on the client&#x2019;s manhood.


Charvet told Breitbart that the robots could be better with their techniques in time as they can be programmed to accommodate the customer&#x2019;s need.


A coffee and a 15-minute fellatio will cost &#xA3;60. Each additional 15 minutes of pleasure will incur a &#xA3;10 surcharge.


Charvet is already launching a fellatio cafe in Switzerland at the end of this year. He will open another one in Manchester if the London one is a success.


&#x201C;The bar is the place to meet people, to extend your network and the way to start the morning. What could be better than meet your friends around a cafe and to enjoy a nice blowjob from a sex robot?&#x201D;</description>

      <title>Tourist bus instantly kills eight-year-old elephant Plai Udom, drags body for 100 feet</title>
      <description>LAMPANG, THAILAND &#x2014; An elephant is dead and a bus driver severly injured after an accident on Oct. 1. 


The 8-year-old elephant, named Plai Udom and believed to be from the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation, had escaped from its jungle enclosure and wandered into the road in the Hang Chat district in Thailand. 


At around 10 p.m., a bus carrying 25 passengers was traveling on the Lampang-Chiang Mai route, driving up Khun Tan hill. Unable to see the pachyderm in the dark until it was too late, the driver could not avoid the animal. 


The bus was traveling at 60 miles per hour. The force of the impact killed the elephant instantly, but its body was dragged 100 feet before the bus came to a complete stop. Bus driver Narit Jittrong, 45, was badly injured and trapped in the driver&#x2019;s seat. 


It took rescuers over an hour to free Jittrong. He was rushed to a nearby hospital. No one else on the bus was injured.


Plai Udom was in the process of being prepared to be released into the Doi Phamuang wildlife sanctuary in Hang Chang.</description>

      <title>Hate crime? White high school student assaulted over possible pro-police comments</title>
      <description>SYLACAUGA, ALABAMA &#x2014; A 17-year-old Sylacauga High School student is recovering in a hospital after authorities say he was beaten up after a homecoming football game last Friday night. 


Sylacauga Police Chief Kelley Johnson said a large group of students gathered in the parking lot of the old Ace Hardware around 10 p.m., WBRC reported.


Johnson said one or more black teens assaulted 17-year-old Brian Ogle. 


When police arrived, they discovered Ogle bleeding from his head. The teen was eventually airlifted to UAB Hospital where he is in critical condition recovering from head injuries, according to WBRC. 


Brandi Allen, the victim&#x2019;s mother, said her son had his skull cracked open in a few places and is bleeding from his brain. 


Police say witnesses said the attack may have stemmed from an argument at the school last week over pro-police comments Ogle posted on his Facebook page. 

Johnson says there may have been a verbal exchange or a social media post about the &#x201C;Black Lives Matter&#x201D; movement, which might have sparked the attack, WBRC reported. 


Authorities have identified and interviewed persons of interest, but no motive has been released and no charges have yet been filed, according to the New York Daily News.</description>

      <title>Crazy Muslim driver: Man used powers to crash into veteran&#x2019;s car in Allah&#x2019;s name</title>
      <description>SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; After a crazy Muslim plowed into his vehicle on a California highway, an Afghanistan war veteran is convinced he was the victim of a terrorist attack.


KPMH reports that Scott Alcala was driving to San Jose to play golf with his father when another vehicle T-boned his car, causing it to fishtail and crash into a barrier. 


Both he and the other car&#x2019;s driver miraculously survived the incident. But what he thought was an accident turned out to be intentional.


In the police report of the incident that Alcala provided to KPMH, Muslim driver Ameer Abbaf Fakhraldin claimed the collision was triggered by Donald Trump&#x2019;s racist treatment of minorities, and by Allah, and &#x201C;other people&#x2019;s lack of faith in him.&#x201D; He told police he was going around 200 miles per hour, and claimed he caused the crash by using his telekinetic powers to control the steering wheel.


An officer at the scene said Fakhraldin was apathetic and didn&#x2019;t seem interested. Alcala described the driver as showing no remorse, adding that he casually went back to his car like it was no big deal.


Alcala said the crash was no different than &#x201C;throwing a bomb in the middle of downtown,&#x201D; but the police have not deemed it a terrorist attack. The FBI is reportedly investigating, though Fakhraldin is not currently in custody.</description>

      <title>U of M now lets students choose personal pronouns, trolling student picks &#x2018;His Majesty&#x2019;</title>
      <description>ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN &#x2014; The University of Michigan has instituted a new initiative to allow students to choose their own personal pronouns. Gender neutral terms like &#x201C;They,&#x201D; &#x201C;Ze,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Zir&#x201D; are expected to be requested, as the institution makes an effort to create an inclusive environment for everyone. 


The new policy also stipulates that if faculty members fail to use each student&#x2019;s preferred pronoun, they may be subject to disciplinary action. A student, Grant Strobl, believes if professors are penalized, the initiative is absurd. Taking advantage of this new policy, Strobl has chosen the pronoun &#x201C;His Majesty.&#x201D; 


Webster&#x2019;s dictionary has yet to include the pronoun &#x201C;Ze&#x201D; as a term in the English language, and so Strobl&#x2019;s stance is if that&#x2019;s the case, students can pretty much choose to go by anything they want.


The university&#x2019;s vice president maintains the new initiative is &#x201C;one of the most basic ways to show your respect for their identity and to cultivate an environment that respects all gender identities.&#x201D;</description>

      <title>Trump tax returns: New York Times breaks story on Trump&#x2019;s $916 million tax write-off</title>
      <description>NEW YORK &#x2014;  Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so big that it would have allowed him to legally not pay federal income taxes for up to 18 years, documents obtained by the New York Times show. 


According to tax experts hired by the New York Times, the massive losses Trump incurred in the early 1990s from three Atlantic City casinos, a failed attempt to get into the airline industry and the purchase of the Plaza Hotel in New York would have let him use the $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an 18-year period. 


Trump declined to comment on the documents, although his campaign did release a statement, the New York Times reported. 


&#x201C;Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,&#x201D; the statement said. &#x201C;That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.&#x201D; 


&#x201C;Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it,&#x201D; the statement continued. 


The problem is that only three pages were mailed to the The Times last month from somewhere in New York City. 


A lawyer representing Trump has contacted The Times arguing that they published illegally obtained documents as Trump has not authorized the disclosure of any of his tax returns, and has threatened legal action.


Trump hopped on Twitter to reiterate the the statement from his campaign, &#x201C;I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes.&#x201D;</description>

      <title>Adorable Thai girls accused of stealing tourist&#x2019;s watch, parents say it&#x2019;s a lie</title>
      <description>CHIANG MAI, THAILAND &#x2014; Two adorable Thai girls were accused of being stealing from tourists in a Reddit post, but the girls and their parents say it was all a lie.


The Reddit post made by a since-deleted user, MedardBoss, was headlined &#x201C;Girlfriend in progress of having her watch stolen,&#x201D; and included an image of two small Thai girls in matching traditional Thai outfits posing with a woman at the Wat Phra That Doi Suthep temple in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Both girls, later identified as Thidaret and Kanlayanee aged 10 and 7, are holding onto the woman&#x2019;s arms. One girl has her fingers around the backside of the woman&#x2019;s wrist watch.


One user asked if the poster had noticed the missing watch during their visit. To which, the poster wrote that they didn&#x2019;t notice until they looked through photos and that the one picture solved the mystery. The poster later wrote that his girlfriend was &#x201C;a bit drunk tbh.&#x201D;


Many users chimed in, saying that the girls&#x2019; actions of touching the woman&#x2019;s arms was actually a skilled pickpocket technique. 


But another user claiming to the unnamed woman in the photo said that the story wasn&#x2019;t true, and the photo was taken from her Facebook page without permission.


Police tracked down the girls&#x2019; parents and questioned them. The parents denounced the allegations and explained that the girls, who visited the temple after school and on weekends, were happy to only take donations for posing in photos.

      <title>Female chess players boycott World Championship in Iran over having to wear hijabs</title>
      <description>ATHENS, GREECE &#x2014; Top female chess players are threatening to boycott the 2017 World Championships after the World Chess Federation (FIDE) announced that the event would be held in Iran, which has in turn stated that women would be required to wear hijabs.


The FIDE said that competitors would face arrest if they did not comply at the upcoming event slated for February 2017 in Tehran, Iran. The organization urged players to respect &#x201C;cultural differences.&#x201D;

Following the announcement, 47-year-old Susan Polgar &#x2014; a former child chess prodigy, Olympic and World champion, and chess coach &#x2014; took to Twitter to bring attention to a blog post she had written, which advocated complying to cultural differences. In many ways, the post urged the wearing of hijabs. 


The tweet caught the attention of Nazi Paikidze, 22, the holder of two FIDE titles, International Master and Woman Grandmaster. Paikidze responded, &#x201C;With all due respect, by wearing a hijab we&#x2019;d be supporting women&#x2019;s oppression,&#x201D; and cited an article from The Independent titled, &#x201C;Iranian woman call on Western tourists to violate hijab to fight against oppression.&#x201D;


Paikidze has made other statements via Twitter. In response to a tweet about the announcement by Nigel Short &#x2014; another chess Grandmaster and commentator, who also disagrees with FIDE&#x2019;s decision &#x2014; Paikidze expressed her regret for having to miss her first Women's World Championship, &#x201C;for many reasons,&#x201D; she wrote attaching an image of a U.S. Passport and International Travel warning about Iran.


On her own Facebook and Instagram pages, she explained, &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s unacceptable to host a WOMEN&#x2019;S World Championship in a place where women do not have basic fundamental rights and are treated as second-class citizens.


&#x201C;For those saying that I don&#x2019;t know anything about Iran: I have received the most support and gratitude from the people of Iran, who are facing this situation every day.&#x201D;


Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, hijabs have been mandatory for women in Iran. The strict law is enforced by the country&#x2019;s &#x201C;morality police.&#x201D; Any woman found not wearing one in public faces arrest, a fine or public admonishment.</description>

      <title>UK woman thrown out off Colossus roller coaster ride because her chest is too large</title>
      <description>SURREY, UNITED KINGDOM &#x2014; Chesty London mother of one Tanya Willis has a 36-L breast size, boobs that are so big, they reportedly got her kicked off a rollercoaster at Thorpe theme park in Surrey. 


According to British tabloid The Mirror, the 22-year-old spent close to 30 British pounds ($35 USD) to ride the park&#x2019;s Colossus roller coaster with her family. However, after queueing for a while and finally getting on the ride, it turned out her chest was too colossal for the safety restraints.


The park told the Mirror that the ride won&#x2019;t start unless the restraints are locked. So when the safety restraints wouldn&#x2019;t snap in place because of Tanya&#x2019;s 36-L chest, she wasn&#x2019;t allowed to ride the roller coaster. 


She told the Mirror that she had to do &#x201C;a walk of shame&#x201D; past everyone else lining up for the ride. The same thing happened at another ride, and she says the park wouldn&#x2019;t give her a refund.</description>

      <title>Duterte killings: Philippines president cozies up to China so he can kill without criticism</title>
      <description>MANILA &#x2014; Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has been criticized internationally by the U.S., U.N., E.U. and activists groups for his war on drugs, which has seen thousands of people killed outside the law. 


One country that hasn&#x2019;t criticized Duterte is China. Not surprisingly, the Chinese have praised Duterte&#x2019;s extra judicial killings, Quartz reported. 


Hua Chunying, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said that China &#x201C;appreciates president Duterte&#x2019;s efforts to crack down on drug crimes and improve social security with the fundamental interests and well-being of his country and people in mind.&#x201D; 


Duterte&#x2019;s incredibly thin skin causes him to lash out when he receives any sort of criticism. He&#x2019;s already on record going off on the Pope, Ban Ki-moon and President Obama. 


But what does Duterte have to say about the Chinese? He said he appreciates that &#x201C;China never criticizes. They help us quietly.&#x201D; 


Unfortunately for Duterte, sucking to the Chinese isn&#x2019;t going to help with the South China Sea. As he and the Philippines will soon learn, all money comes with strings attached.</description>

      <title>Uber driver in Toronto demands passenger give oral sex or flash breasts to pay for ride</title>
      <description>TORONTO &#x2014; A woman is putting Uber on blast after she was aggressively sexually harassed by a driver who tried to strike an indecent proposal.


On October 16, 28-year-old Erika Szabo called for an Uber cab as she was leaving an event downtown. When she got into the car, she realized her phone had just died. Worried her payment wouldn&#x2019;t go through, she informed the driver. He told Szabo that the ride would not get processed, but offered an alternative means of payment &#x2013; perform oral sex, or flash her breasts for him.


Disgusted, she refused, but the driver seemed to think it was no big deal, and kept on pressing for his twisted fantasy to come true. Szabo repeatedly asked for him to let her out of the car, but the man instead offered her a third option: he&#x2019;d pay her for a blowjob.


Eventually, he took her back to her neighborhood, and she got out of the car. Soon after, she plugged in her phone to find out the ride had indeed gone through. She contacted Uber customer service, who called to apologize and refunded her $12.


The man has since been dropped by the ride service as a driver, but Szabo only found out through media reports. She later took to Facebook to warn others of her frighteningly common story, and has filed a sexual assault report with Toronto police.</description>

      <title>Milwaukee riots: Cop who shot Sylville Smith charged with sexual assault</title>
      <description>MILWAUKEE &#x2014; The police officer who sparked citywide riots in Milwaukee when he shot a man dead earlier this year has been charged with sexual assault.


Officer Dominique Heaggan-Brown fatally shot armed suspect Sylville Smith in August, leading to violent unrest. 


On Aug. 14, authorities allege that Brown met one of his victims in a bar. There Brown allegedly &#x201C;bragged about being able to do whatever he wanted without repercussions,&#x201D; reported the Washington Post.


The alleged victim got drunk and said he woke up to Heaggan-Brown having sex with him. According to a criminal complaint posted by CBS 58 Milwaukee, the next morning the Milwaukee cop took the man to the hospital, where the victim told staff about the alleged sexual assault.


Heaggan-Brown later texted police Sergeant Joseph Hall asking for help. He told him the sex was consensual, but acknowledged the man was drunk.


Another victim alleged that he met Brown at a party in a stripclub in July. The two got very drunk, and the last thing the victim remembered was waking up naked beside Brown the following morning.


But it gets worse: The cops allegedly found photos of the man on Brown&#x2019;s phone that showed them and another man having sexual contact. The victim said he didn&#x2019;t consent to those photos.


And it&#x2019;s not just sexual assault Brown is accused of, it&#x2019;s prostitution as well. 


Another man claims that in December the Milwaukee cop offered to pay him for sex in a series of text messages. And another guy told the cops that Brown paid him in July in exchange for sex. He alleged they had sex at least three or four times.


A judge set Brown&#x2019;s bail at $100,000 on Thursday, reported CBS 58 Milwaukee. He&#x2019;s facing several charges, including second-degree sexual assault and prostitution.</description>

      <title>Third Presidential Debate: Trump, Clinton bet big in Sin City while America loses</title>
      <description>LAS VEGAS &#x2014; Bad Hombre Donald Trump said he wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily accept the results of a rigged election should Nasty Woman Hillary Clinton beat him in the presidential election, which is scheduled for November 28.


In last night&#x2019;s final presidential debate, Trump told moderator Chris Wallace that he would decide on the day of the election if whether to accept the result. &#x201C;I will keep you in suspense,&#x201D; he said.


Trump outlined his immigration plan, saying he would first get rid of the bad hombres, followed by the esses and the vatos.


Clinton called Trump a puppet of Russian president Vladimir Putin, because Russian hackers have leaked emails to Julian Assange and Wikileaks. Trump said Clinton was the puppet.  


The winner of the debate was clearly ringmaster Chris Wallace as he successfully kept everyone in check and the mudslinging to a minimum. 


With just days left until the election, who do you think America is going to vote for? Leave your thoughts in the comments.</description>

      <title>Trump dissed: 200 people walk out after Amy Schumer mocks Trump during Tampa comedy show</title>
      <description>TAMPA, FLORIDA &#x2014; Comedian Amy Schumer successfully angered more than 200 people, after she mocked Donald Trump at her Tampa comedy show.


The Tampa Bay Times reports that Schumer&#x2019;s performance at the Amalie Arena on Sunday started out with her standard lineup of raunchy sex stories about herself.


But talk turned political when the comic pulled the Trump card, referencing the Republican candidate&#x2019;s recent remark about grabbing women&#x2019;s privates.


She invited a Trump supporter on stage to defend his choice. The man explained that he was voting Trump because didn&#x2019;t trust Hillary. That didn&#x2019;t sit well with Schumer, and the man was promptly dismissed.


A number of audience members booed, and around 200 walked out as Schumer referred to Donald as an &#x201C;orange, sexual-assaulting, fake-college-starting monster&#x201D; who &#x201C;wanted to finger his daughter.&#x201D;


She directed security to chuck out any hecklers and proceeded to fangirl over Hillary to the rest of the 8,400 people in the audience.


A bunch of netizens took to social media to give Schumer flak about mocking Trump, but the comedian seemed unfazed. She&#x2019;s performing at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, according to the New York Times, where she may or may not dole out more anti-Trump Schumerisms.</description>

      <title>Old lady accidentally drives her SUV into a pond, rescued by three good Samaritans</title>
      <description>ARLINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS &#x2014; Three men sprang into action when a woman accidentally drove her SUV into a pond on Friday afternoon. 


Helen Joyce, 68, was parking her Ford Edge on a roundabout in Arlington, Massachusetts when she jumped curb and drove into a pond, according a report by WCVB Boston.


Fortunately for her, three good Samaritans saw what happened.


Dan Frazier and Kenneth Chapman were cycling nearby and jumped into the water to help. As did Cesar Perozo, who reached the sinking vehicle first and told Joyce to exit through the back door. 


But water rushed in as soon as Perozo opened the back door, causing the SUV to sink further into the water. 


Perozo was unable to find Joyce and feared for the worst. But she miraculous resurfaced, fully conscious. 


Frazier and Chapman pulled Joyce from the water. She was taken to a local hospital, where she was treated for mild hypothermia.
 
Arlington Police Chief Frederick Ryan said Joyce will not face criminal charges, but her ability to drive safely will be reviewed.</description>

      <title>Duterte kowtows in China: Philippines president visits Beijing to kiss some Chinese butt</title>
      <description>MANILA &#x2014; Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to visit China this week, and will meet President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang.


Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed the Oct. 18-21 trip saying the two sides would have a &#x201C;deep exchange of views&#x201D; on how to improve relations, cooperation and regional issues, Reuters reported. 


The visit comes at a time when Manila and Washington&#x2019;s relations are strained after several outbursts from Duterte since taking office in June. 


Accompanying Duterte to Beijing will be around 250 Philippines business executives, according to Reuters. 


&#x201C;China looks forward to increasing mutual trust between the two countries, deepening practical cooperation and continuing the tradition of friendship via the visit of President Duterte,&#x201D; Geng said during a press briefing. 


Duterte has been criticized by many world leaders and organizations, including the U.S., for his deadly war on drugs and support for extrajudicial killings. 


The Philippines president also said that he will probably visit Russia after a trip to Japan later this month, Reuters reported.</description>

      <title>Unknown illness causing hallucinations that spread from woman to other people in Oregon</title>
      <description>NORTH BEND, OREGON &#x2014; An unknown illness appears to have spread from one woman to four other people in Oregon, including two deputies, and caused them to have hallucinations.


According to KVAL News, the incident began at around 3 a.m. on Wednesday, when a 57-year-old caregiver reported someone vandalizing her car outside the home where she works in North Bend.


A deputy responded her report but found nothing. The caregiver called the police again several hours later. The deputies then suspected the woman might be having hallucinations caused by medical issues.


She was taken to a hospital for examination, but medical personnel were unable to find anything unusual, so she was released.


Shortly after she was released, the two deputies who handled the caregiver began having hallucinations and had to be hospitalized. The woman who was cared by the woman and a hospital employee also began exhibiting symptoms of hallucinations and had to be hospitalized.


The Coos Bay Hazmat Team has not yet found the source of the contamination, but they said the illness appears to be passing through human contact.</description>

      <title>Hacked emails show how Clinton campaign uses ties with press to shape the narrative</title>
      <description>WASHINGTON &#x2014; Hacked emails and other documents published over the past week by WikiLeaks and the Intercept show how journalists allowed Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s campaign to shape the narrative in exchange for access to the candidate.


An email obtained by WikiLeaks shows New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich allowing Clinton&#x2019;s staff to edit a story he was writing about her. 


This included removing a reference to Sarah Palin as well as the quote: &#x201C;and gay rights has moved much faster than women's rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon somebody in the future will unpack.&#x201D;


In a hacked Clinton campaign strategy document cited by the Intercept, then-Politico writer Maggie Haberman is referred to as a &#x201C;friendly journalist&#x201D; who had &#x201C;teed up&#x201D; stories for Clinton.


Haberman was discussed in a section titled &#x201C;Placing a Story,&#x201D; a brief but textbook example of how interviews conducted &#x201C;on background&#x201D; are used by to plant ideas in the media without revealing the source or their motivations.


Most of the documents have been released as part of WikiLeaks ongoing drip feed of hacked emails from Clinton&#x2019;s top aides, others were provided by Russian hacker persona Guccifer 2.0.


Obama administration officials claim the emails were stolen by Russian hackers, and many pundits believe they are part of an information war being waged by Moscow to get Donald Trump elected.


Leibovich tweeted yesterday that the New York Times agreed to the arrangement with &#x201C;much reluctance&#x201D; as it &#x201C;provided our only entree to the subject.&#x201D;


Haberman, who is now with the New York Times, declined a request placed 24 hours in advance of publication from the Intercept to comment.</description>

      <title>Samsung Galaxy Note 7: Samsung scraps flagship smartphone because it&#x2019;s so damn hot</title>
      <description>SEOUL &#x2014; Samsung has decided to pull the plug on its Galaxy Note 7 less than two months after its release after failing to solve its battery problem. 


Samsung announced a massive recall of 2.5 million Note 7s at the beginning of September after numerous reports of phones overheating, burning and even exploding, Reuters reported. 


On Tuesday, the tech giant decided to scrap all production of the Note 7, in what could be one of the costliest product safety blunders in tech history, according to Reuters. 


During the Galaxy Note 7&#x2019;s extremely short lifespan, the company received more than 100 reports of devices catching fire, according to Slate. 


The decision to kill production came on the heels of fresh reports of replacement devices catching on fire, which prompted regulators, phone carriers and airlines to issue new warnings, according to Reuters. 


Last week, a Southwest Airlines flight had to be evacuated after one of the replacement handsets began smoking.  


Samsung is now advising anyone with a Note 7 to shut it off immediately and take it back to the store for an exchange or refund. 


Analysts said the death of the Note 7 could cost the company up to $17 billion. Samsung stock took a beating on Tuesday as shares closed down 8 percent, wiping nearly $20 billion of its market value.</description>

      <title>Married science teacher accused of using classroom as her own student relationship lab</title>
      <description>CHICAGO &#x2014; A Chicago teacher has been charged with teaching two students about her body after sending racy messages to them on social media.


According to court documents cited by the Chicago Tribune, June Kendall, a science teacher at Urban Prep Academy, began &#x201C;prepping&#x201D; the two boys after making friends with them on Snapchat.


The messages became more inappropriate until this fall, when she began sending them sexually charged messages and images of her in various states of undress.


Kendall is accused of having sex with one of the boys in September. She is alleged to have had sex with the same student again in an annex of her classroom last Monday, before having sex with the second boy in school later the same day.


Kendall was seen leaving her classroom with the first boy and was reported to school administrators by the person who saw her. The second boy reportedly told a friend about his encounter.


Police found out about the second incident after they launched their investigation.


Kendall faces charges of criminal sexual assault and was ordered held on $100,000 bond. She is due back in court today.</description>

      <title>Second presidential debate: Trump and Hillary go gutter for town hall debate</title>
      <description>ST. LOUIS &#x2014; All eyes were on the second presidential debate at Washington University Sunday night, only days after Trump&#x2019;s now infamous crotch grabbing video was leaked. 


Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton got the night started off by refusing to shake each other hands. 


Moderator Anderson Cooper dove right with a question about the 2005 Trump video in which he spoke of groping women. Trump responded by saying that it was only locker room talk, and then started rambling about ISIS.    


Trump was on the offensive all night. He promised he would prosecute Clinton if elected, and send her to jail over her deleted emails. The billionaire also tried to paint Bill Clinton as a serial abuser of women.       


Meanwhile, Clinton reminded everyone that Muslims had been in America since the days of George Washington. She also said that to succeed in Washington, you needed to be two-faced like that great statesman Abraham Lincoln.


Trump also spend much of the night whining about Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, saying they were unfair moderators.


Who do you think won the second debate? Does it even really matter?</description>

      <title>Donald Trump audio: When you&#x2019;re a TV star, you can GHRITP, Trump say</title>
      <description>WASHINGTON &#x2014; Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump bragged about groping and forcing himself on women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying: &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p***y. You can do anything.&#x201D;


The comments&#x2014;revolting by anyone&#x2019;s standards, in a political season where Trump has re-calibrated standards lower and lower&#x2014;could cost the billionaire businessman his spot at the top of the GOP ticket.


House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to cancel an appearance with Trump in Wisconsin, though he has yet to rescind his support.


Meanwhile, several Republicans denounced Trump and others said he should be replaced. They include Colorado representative Mike Coffman, Utah representative Jason Chaffetz, Utah governor Jon Huntsman, Utah senator Mike Lee and Illinois senator Mark Kirk. 


Trump made the comments after conducting an interview with Access Hollywood host Billy Bush. A recording of a hot microphone conversation was leaked to the Washington Post, which published the video on Friday.


WHAT TRUMP SAID:
You know and I moved on her actually (Nancy O&#x2019;Dell). You know she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her and I failed. I&#x2019;ll admit it. I did try and f*** her, she was married. And I moved on her very heavily in fact I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said: I&#x2019;ll show you where they have some nice furniture. I took her out for furniture. I moved on her like a b***h, but I couldn&#x2019;t get there, and she was married &#x2026; You know I&#x2019;m automatically attracted to beautiful &#x2013; I just start kissing them. It&#x2019;s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don&#x2019;t even wait. And when you&#x2019;re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p***y. You can do anything.</description>

      <title>Special needs child doused with gasoline, set on fire by bully playmates in Texas</title>
      <description>KERRVILLE, TEXAS &#x2014; A 10-year-old special needs child is in a coma and struggling for his life after being severely burned in an extreme bullying incident on Sunday.


Kayden Culp has trouble speaking and hearing and, according to his mother, exhibits autistic behavior that often gets him bullied, reports Fox San Antonio.


On Sunday afternoon, he was with two boys at a vacant lot in Kerrville, Texas, when his playmates took him into a nearby shed. One boy poured gasoline on him. The other set him on fire with a lighter.


The resulting fire burned almost 20 percent of Culp&#x2019;s body, from his ears to his belly button. He had to be rushed to the hospital, where he remains in a coma.


Police on Wednesday arrested one of Culp&#x2019;s attackers and charged him with first-degree arson, according to KSAT.


The other attacker&#x2019;s family may be on the run, with neighbors reportedly witnessing them fleeing their house in the middle of the night.</description>

      <title>Pence wins veep debate: Pence outshines Trump to beat Kaine in VP debate</title>
      <description>FARMVILLE, VIRGINIA &#x2014; Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and Indiana governor Mike Pence met in the first and only vice-presidential debate on Tuesday, with the GOP No 2 handily defeating his opponent.


Pence spoke more like the smooth and measured statesman that his shouty running mate is not. He calmly articulated GOP positions on taxation, the growing debt and national security, offering a credible alternative to the current Republican standard bearer.


Pence was effective running lines of attack that Donald Trump fumbled in the first presidential debate. He hit the Clinton Foundation for its conflicts of interest. He tweaked Hillary Clinton for jeopardizing national security by setting up an authorized e-mail server.


Several times, Tim Kaine resorted to pre-canned lines on Trump&#x2019;s failure to release his tax returns, but never drew blood. 


Kaine was more effective in getting Pence to parse and Trump-splain some of the Donald&#x2019;s wilder comments, such as whether 16 million immigrants would be deported (nonsense, says Pence) or whether Trump had, in fact, understood that Russia invaded Crimea (Pence insists this to be the case).


Vice presidential debates are largely meaningless. They rarely influence the general election.  But we can&#x2019;t help wonder what this contest would look like with Pence at the top of the ticket. Clinton is fortunate she&#x2019;s facing Trump and not Mike Pence.</description>

      <title>Creepy clown hoax: Man arrested after fake Facebook clown warning causes locals to panic</title>
      <description>LIVONIA, NEW YORK &#x2014; A man from Livonia, New York decided to troll his community by getting in on the creepy clown bandwagon, and everyone overreacted.


The Genesee Sun reports that Christopher Cody Hooper posted about a clown sighting on his Facebook page. In the post, Hooper said he spotted a clown on the swings while at Vitale Park one night. He put up a photo he claimed took of the clown, adding that the man ran away as soon as he did. The photo came with a warning not to go to the park alone or at night, and urged netizens to pass on the advice.


In reality, though, the image Hooper put up online was an especially well-photoshopped fake.


Recent &#x2018;sightings&#x2019; across different states have already caused people to be unreasonably afraid of clowns, despite the lack of any credible threat. According to the Livingston County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, Hooper&#x2019;s hoax supposedly caused concern among locals, and sowed public alarm and panic.


Police eventually tracked Hooper down and arrested him for Falsely Reporting an Incident in the 3rd Degree. He may be facing jail time and a $1,000 fine.


Reaction has been mixed on the incident, with some praising the authorities for acting quickly, while others saying Hooper was merely exercising his freedom of speech. 


If America&#x2019;s massive hysteria over clowns proves anything, it&#x2019;s that free speech and due process go flying out the window once people subscribe to fear, however irrational.</description>

      <title>Kim Kardashian hoax? Tons of people think Kim K&#x2019;s Paris robbery was fake or staged</title>
      <description>PARIS &#x2014; Even though French cops say Kim Kardashian was robbed of nearly 10 million euros worth of jewels at gunpoint, many online &#x2014; as you&#x2019;d expect &#x2014; reckon the entire heist was faked or even staged.


People took to the Western world&#x2019;s truth hole, aka Twitter, to give their take on what really went down. A user with the handle @RealHarisKopic tweeted, &#x201C;Plot twist. Kardashian has an insurance policy. Faked heist,&#x201D; while @kccrimefighter says it was a &#x201C;fake PR stunt hoax!&#x201D; 


Another, which we saw in a tweet by @Dblanchard that Heavy.com reported, suggests Russia orchestrated it to distract people from the Donald&#x2019;s really, really bad week. 


Meanwhile, many believe the crime was perpetrated to distract us from the death of Harambe. Wasn&#x2019;t that five months ago?


One more likely scenario being thrown around is that the heist was perpetrated by the Pink Panther gang, a team of notorious European jewel thieves.


Theories aside, questions do remain. Like where&#x2019;s the surveillance footage from the hotel? And just how the heck did these armed robbers know where Kim K was? Give us your take on the story in the comments below.</description>

      <title>NBC Mail Order Family: NBC scraps Filipina mail order bride comedy after backlash</title>
      <description>NEW YORK &#x2014; NBC announced last Friday it was canceling it plans for Mail Order Family only two days after saying it would develop the comedy. 


In response to backlash from the Asian-American community, NBC Entertainment executives decided not to go ahead with the show, according to NBC News. 


&#x201C;We purchased the pitch with the understanding that it would tell the creator&#x2019;s real-life experience of being raised by a strong Filipina stepmother after the loss of her own mother,&#x201D; an NBC spokesperson said in a statement. &#x201C;The writer and producers have taken the sensitivity to the initial concept to heart and have chosen not to move forward with the project at this time.&#x201D; 


Deadline reported last Wednesday that NBC was developing a show loosely based on the life of writer and producer Jackie Clarke about a widowed father who orders a Filipina mail order bride to help raise his two daughters.


When Asians talk about getting more roles in and behind the scenes, this is not what we mean. Thankfully, NBC came to its senses.</description>

      <title>Woman humps dinosaur statue: photos of nasty deed done at Exmouth Dino Trail in England</title>
      <description>EXMOUTH, ENGLAND &#x2014; Photographs of a woman doing unsanitary deeds at a theme park are catching crazy clicks online this week.


The Exmouth Dino Trail in East Devon, England features 17 life-size dinosaurs models, and one of them was violated. The woman must have been really loved the safari trail, and something along the way must have got her going, because before long, she was getting off by getting it on with a statue of a prehistoric suitor. 


Photos were snapped of the affair, and the woman has risen to the top of internet&#x2019;s nasty files. 


Soon after the photographs made the rounds online, photos of a custodian sanitizing the statue were released. Police are still trying to track the woman down.</description>

      <title>NATO v Russia: UK and US to deploy 1700 military staff in NATO force near Russian border</title>
      <description>BRUSSELS &#x2014; The biggest build-up of NATO forces since the Cold War is set to be deployed next year on Russia&#x2019;s European borders.


According to Reuters, American and British military personnel are being sent to join NATO forces in eastern Europe in 2017 after a series of high-profile Russian military maneuvers in the region.


The British Ministry of Defense said in a news release on its website that Royal Air Force Typhoon aircraft will be deployed to Romania for four months in 2017. In addition, around 800 British military personnel will be sent to Estonia. This is said to likely include infantry, tanks, armored fighting vehicles tactical drones.


The U.S. Department of Defense said in a news release that it will send 900 troops to Poland. According to Reuters, another American force made up of tanks will be deployed to maneuver across eastern Europe.


When assembled, the NATO force is expected to consist of 4,000 personnel that will be backed a 40,000-strong rapid reaction force. 


The forces are set to be in place by the summer of 2017.</description>

      <title>Iran &#x2018;suicide drone&#x2019;: Photos released by Iranian navy show maritime surveillance UAV</title>
      <description>IRAN &#x2014; On October 26, Iran&#x2019;s Navy released photographs of a specialized seaplane drone that can reportedly be weaponized for targeted kamikaze missions. 


Iran&#x2019;s new seaplane drone can be armed with missiles and heavy payloads of explosives to launch suicide attacks. If directed, it can collide with any target and destroy it, be it a vessel at sea or an onshore command center.


Fitted with a camera that can be used at night and in "damp sea conditions,&#x201D; the drone can operate for up to four hours straight at a maximum speed of 250 km per hour. The unmanned aircraft can fly as high as 3000 feet in the air, as low as 20 inches above the surface, and can land on water.


The drone is said to have been developed primarily for maritime surveillance, and is not necessarily designed to carry a missile payload.</description>

      <title>Narco-torpedo: Colombian cartels are using high-tech torpedoes to smuggle drugs</title>
      <description>BOGOTA, COLOMBIA &#x2014; The Colombian Navy on Octob. 23 found 73 kg of cocaine submerged and attached to a docked sailboat off Baru island near the coastal city of Cartagena on Oct. 23.
 
Colombian authorities say towing drugs in these so-called &#x201C;narco torpedos&#x201D; is a new trafficking technique favored by the country's drug cartels.


According to InSight Crime, the drugs are loaded onto a torpedo-shaped container, which is attached to the bottom of a boat by a cable. The drug-carrying boat sets off with other boats. One boat acts as a decoy to divert the authorities&#x2019; attention so the other boats, including the one carrying the drugs, can get a away. If the drug-carrying boat is intercepted, it releases the torpedo to avoid detection. The torpedo then releases a buoy that emits a GPS signal, allowing it to be recovered by another boat.


Univision reported that the narco torpedo was developed back in 2000. An earlier version used a radio-transmitter. Other variations include attaching the drug-laden torpedoes to the bottom of freight ships to be retrieved by divers at night after the vessel has docked at port.</description>

      <title>Burial pods that turn bodies into trees are an eco-friendly alternative to coffins</title>
      <description>ROME &#x2014; Two designers in Italy have developed a new way of burying your loved ones that can turn them into trees.


The project is called Capsula Mundi. The body is put into a fetal position in order to fit inside the burial pod, which is made of biodegradable materials, according to the Capsula Mundi website. 


The burial pod is then buried in the soil with a tree seed or a young tree planted directly above. The pods come in smaller sizes that could be used for ashes or even for pets.


The burial pod would decompose naturally and provide nutrients for the tree. Each tree is recorded in a GPS system for identification purposes. More burial pods could turn a cemetery into a forest. Thus, friends and family of the deceased would then visit a forest to pay their respects instead of a cemetery full of headstones.


This type of burial is prohibited by Italian law but is legal in some places in the U.S. and Britain. The designers hope to produce the industrial prototype by next year.</description>

      <title>Trump&#x2019;s US-Mexico border wall would likely cost up to $40 billion, according to MIT</title>
      <description>CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS &#x2014; The MIT Technology Review is questioning Donald Trump&#x2019;s claim that his proposed border wall will cost $12 billion. According to MIT, the cost could be closer to $40 billion.


Trump initially proposed to build a wall along all 2,000 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, but then revised it down to half of the border, with the rest of the border left obstructed by natural barriers such as mountains.


According to the MIT Technology Review, building a wall 50 feet tall with 10 feet extended underground, at a length of 1,000 miles, will require about 9.7 million cubic meters of concrete, which costs about $9 billion. Since Trump has promised the wall will be reinforced with steel, it will need about 2.3 billion kilograms of steel, which adds $4.6 billion to the cost. The addition of labour costs and other expenses brings the estimated cost to between $27 billion and $40 billion.


Bernstein Research previously calculated in July that a wall of 5 ft wide, 1 ft deep and 1,000 miles long would require a total of 7.1 million m3 of concrete at a cost of over $700 million. It would also require around 2.4 million tonnes of cement at a cost of around $240 million. Labor, land acquisition and construction payments would bring the cost for the wall to between $15 billion and $25 billion.


It is not clear who will be paying for the construction as Trump insists that Mexico will pay for it, while Mexico insists that it will not. Trump has also suggested to reporters that he could ransom Mexico into paying by blocking undocumented immigrants from sending money home, the BBC reported.</description>

      <title>Clean air machine: Dutch inventors unveil giant vacuum that sucks smog out of the air</title>
      <description>AMSTERDAM &#x2014; A Dutch tech company has unveiled a giant vacuum cleaner that purifies the air by sucking toxic particles out of the atmosphere.


The machine can filter 100 percent of fine particles and 95 percent of ultra-fine particles in the air, inventors the Envinity Group wrote on the company&#x2019;s website. It can clean about 800,000 cubic meters of air an hour.


Fine particles in the air are caused by emissions from burning fuels and industrial combustion. Fine particles are particles smaller than 10 micrometers and ultra-fine particles are smaller than 0.1 micrometers. 


Governments, businesses, and airports have already expressed an interest in the machine, according to RT.</description>

      <title>Uber self-driving truck hauls 50,000 cans of Budweiser across Colorado with NO driver</title>
      <description>COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO &#x2014; A driverless Uber truck loaded with 50,000 cans of Budweiser beer made a 120-mile journey across Colorado last week in the first commercial shipment by a self-driving truck.


Otto is Uber&#x2019;s self-driving truck subsidiary. Its vehicles can drive autonomously on the highway, leaving the driver free to do other tasks, or relax.


Otto&#x2019;s Volvo trucks are retrofitted with lidar, radar and cameras, which collect data that onboard computers translate into driving directions, Wired reported.


The self-driving trucks maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and only change lanes when necessary. The technology only works on the highway so drivers are still needed to navigate trickier city roads.


Otto believes that in the future self-driving trucks will drive on the interstate, with human drivers handling the last few miles into town.


Trucks haul 70 percent of freight in the U.S., but the industry has a shortfall of 48,000 drivers, which could reach 175,000 within 10 years, Wired reported, citing the American Trucking Association.


Otto hopes that driverless trucks can make up the deficit of drivers, reduce emissions and increase efficiency. It also thinks driverless trucks will make roads safer by reducing human error. There are 400,000 truck crashes in the U.S. each year, which claim 4,000 lives, Wired reported, citing federal statistics.</description>

      <title>Type 055 destroyer: China may launch its largest surface warship in late 2017</title>
      <description>BEIJING &#x2014; China is reportedly getting reach to launch its Type 055 destroyer in 2017, which will be one of the surface warship in Asia since Japanese Tone class heavy cruisers in World World 2.


The Type 055 destroyer is said to be up to 180 meters in length with a displacement capacity of about 12,000 to 14,000 tons.


The destroyer is equipped with electronics support measures mast, which could collect and process enemy electronic activity such as radars, communications and jamming. It is equipped with 112 vertical launch system cells, which can hold a variety of missiles, Sina reported.


According to the New American, the Type 055 destroyer is said to be more powerful than United States&#x2019; stealth Zumwalt-class destroyer, which took four years and a cost of $4.3 billion to build. Chinese media Takung Pao reported that the cost of one Zumwalt-class destroyer could build 13 Type 055 destroyers.</description>

      <title>Microsoft is building underwater data centers inspired by the Halo video game series</title>
      <description>REDMOND, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; Microsoft is researching ways to move power hungry and heat-prone data centers underwater.


Last year, the company sent a server inside a steel hull 30 feet below the Pacific Ocean, off the California coast.


Along with pressurized nitrogen to cool computer chips, the temperature at the ocean floor helped keep the server cool. The experiment ran for 105 days, between August and November of 2015. The hull was named Leona Philpot &#x2014; after a character from the Halo video game series, according to Microsoft Research.


Last year&#x2019;s experiment was powered by a land-based power grid, but Microsoft aims to develop other power sources. The company believes that renewable resources such as tidal energy could power underwater data centers.


Microsoft eventually hopes to develop underwater datacenters with a two decade-lifespan. The data centers would be deployed over five-year periods, with computer hardware replaced at the end of each deployment.


The company is working on the next phase of the research, which it said includes a vessel that is quadruple the size and will hold 20 times as much computer power.</description>

      <title>Selfie drone: Hover Camera Passport takes art of the selfie to dizzying new heights</title>
      <description>BEIJING &#x2014; A Chinese startup has developed a drone equipped with facial recognition technology that takes aerial selfies of its user.


The drone is dubbed the Hover Camera Passport and was developed by Zero Zero Robotics in Beijing. 


The Hover Camera Passport can fly up to 17 mph and climb as high as 16 feet, according to Mashable. The device can be remotely controlled by a smartphone. One battery charge can power up to 10 minutes of flight time.


The camera has face- and body-tracking functions, according to Hover Camera Passport&#x2019;s official website. It can also orbit around the user to take photographs from all angles.


The Hover Camera Passport costs $599, which Mashable reported is much cheaper than other products on the market with similar functions.


The company has labeled the device a &#x201C;flying camera,&#x201D; and has been reluctant to call it a drone, Mashable reported.</description>

      <title>China&#x2019;s social credit system to implement in 2020, hopes to create a country without fraud</title>
      <description>BEIJING &#x2014; In an effort to build a harmonious socialist society without any fraud, China has planned to implement a social credit system that will monitor the behaviour of every Chinese citizen.


The China&#x2019;s social credit system is likely to monitor a person&#x2019;s social media activity, career movement, online purchases, financial and criminal records and translate them into a credit score, according to the BBC and News.com.au.


The person&#x2019;s social network is also crucial to determine his or her credit score, as having friends with low credit score will bring down one&#x2019;s own credit score too.


A person with low credit score may be deemed &#x2018;untrustworthy&#x2019;, and the subsequent sanctions may include difficulties in getting loans, hotel rooms or even denied travelling abroad.


The system is in its pilot phase with eight private companies commissioned to set up their own credit databases. Alibaba&#x2019;s Sesame system is highly popular and is used as a gauge to measure one&#x2019;s honesty on China&#x2019;s biggest dating website Baihe. Other private companies include internet giant Tencent and Qianhai Zhengxin, owned by China&#x2019;s biggest insurance and financial group Ping An Insurance.


The system is expected to cover everyone in China by 2020.</description>

      <title>China blast: 10 killed, 157 injured as explosion rips through town in northwest China</title>
      <description>XINMIN, CHINA &#x2014; A powerful blast tore through China&#x2019;s Shaanxi province on Monday, killing 10 people and injuring scores more.


The explosion originated from a building in the town of Xinmin, which residents said may have had illegally stored explosives hidden inside, Xinhua reported.


A nearby hospital and several other buildings were damaged by the blast, which left behind a 5-meter wide and 4-meter deep crater.


At least 10 people were reported dead, and as many as 157 injured.


China has a poor safety record, with improperly stored industrial explosives causing explosions in the past, most notably in the series of blasts that killed 165 people in Tianjin last year, according to Reuters.</description>

      <title>US elections 2016: with fewer seats to defend, Democrats could regain Senate control</title>
      <description>WASHINGTON &#x2014; There is a good chance the Democrats could take reclaim control of the U.S. Senate in November, thanks to the large number of seats the Republicans are defending.


A key race to watch: Missouri, where former military intelligence officer Jason Kander leads Republican incumbent Roy Blunt in 2 of 3 polls taken in October. Kander is killing it in the Show Me State, thanks to showing off his AR15-assembly-while-blindfolded skills.


Also look to Illinois, where Democratic Representative Tammy Duckworth leads polls by a wide margin. Duckworth, also a military veteran, is challenging incumbent Republican Mark Kirk.


At present, the Democrats have 44 seats. Two independent caucus with the Democrats, giving them 46 seats to the Republicans&#x2019; 54 seats. Thirty-four seats are up for grabs. The Democrats are defending just 10 seats, while the Republicans are defending 19. This leaves the GOP more vulnerable.


The Democrats would need to flip just 5 seats to take control. Four if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency.


Flipping five seats would give the Democrats a 51-seat majority. Some of the more vulnerable states for the Republicans are Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, New Hampshire, Missouri and Pennsylvania, where Democrats are polling strong and challenging Republican incumbents.


With the Democrats in charge, maybe Supreme Court nominees can get a hearing.  But they better act fast. In 2018. the Republicans will defend just eight seats in solid red states. Meanwhile, seats held by 23 Democrats and the two independents will be up for grabs.</description>

      <title>SkunkLock bicycle lock deters bike thieves with noxious, vomit-inducing gas</title>
      <description>SAN FRANCISCO &#x2014; A pair of San Francisco inventors fed up with getting their bicycles stolen have come up with a chemical deterrent to stop bike thieves.


The SkunkLock contains a vomit-inducing gas that is released when it is cut into.


Co-creators Daniel Idzkowski and Yves Perrenout see huge potential for the device because around $350 million worth of bicycles are stolen in the U.S. each year, according to SkunkLock&#x2019;s Indiegogo page.


The U-shaped SkunkLock is made of medium-carbon steel and has a hollow chamber inside that contains one of three different pressurized gases. Some of the gas formulas contain capsaicin, the active component in chili peppers.
 
The formulas are detectable even through gas masks, and ruins any clothing they come into contact with.


The gas smells unpleasant from up to 10 feet away, which could draw unwanted attention to potential bicycle thieves.


The inventors admit the SkunkLock is not foolproof and could probably be picked but say that would take up to 30 minutes because the device has an advanced disc-cylinder tumbler lock, the Guardian reported.


The chemicals in the SkunkLock are legal and compliant with state and national laws. 


Idzkowski and Perrenout set a target of $20,000 on their Indiegogo page, but have already received more than $25,000 in pledges. The first SkunkLocks will be shipped to customers by June next year, according to the Guardian.</description>

      <title>Future transport: Narrow Tilting Vehicle with Non-Tilting Wheels could lean 52 degrees</title>
      <description>RIDGE MANOR, FLORIDA &#x2014; A Florida inventor has designed a three-wheeled vehicle that can tilt 52 degrees.


The vehicle is called Narrow Tilting Vehicle with Non-Tilting Wheels. It is a reverse trike style vehicle with two wheels at the front. According to New Atlas, the vehicle can be manufactured into two, three or four wheel configurations.


The vehicle uses flat car tires rather than curved motorcycle tires, as they do not tilt relative to the road. The cabin is managed by hydraulic actuators that create a cradle mechanism, which allows the cabin to tilt when the road surface angle is changing or a cornering G-force is being applied.


The designer, Frank Knisley, said the cabin can tilt up to 52 degrees, creating a flying sensation without using one&#x2019;s own body as a counterbalance. Knisley is currently looking to team up with other people to produce a prototype of the vehicle.</description>

      <title>Bats vs. Zika mosquitoes: Miami Beach builds bat houses to eradicate virus</title>
      <description>MIAMI &#x2014; Zika virus-carrying mosquitoes in Florida may be in for their own deadly scare. In an effort to combat the spread of the virus, decision-makers in Miami Beach have approved the installation of a few bat houses in city parks to offer bats attractive housing options in mosquito-populated areas.


To combat the spread of Zika virus, small bat houses will be installed in city parks to attract bats looking for a place to roost. Bats prefer warm, narrow spaces that offer shelter from predators and the elements. A good bat house will be built tight to mimic their natural habitats. Mother bats are most attracted to bat houses close to a water source, so they won&#x2019;t have to travel too far from their young. Bat houses should be positioned for maximum sun exposure, placed 15-20 feet in the air to allow the bats enough room to swoop down and fly away.


The bat houses are being implemented because bats are expert mosquito-killers, with the ability to consume as many as 1000 in under an hour. The move is also a nod to environmentalists upset over nearby Miami-Dade county being sprayed with naled, an insecticide used to eradicate the mosquitoes.</description>

      <title>Barnacle windshield blockers might be replacing clunky parking boots</title>
      <description>NEW YORK &#x2014; Philadelphia and Fort Lauderdale are trying out a new alternative to the parking boot. 


Jamming a wheel to force a driver to confront unpaid parking fines may have been the norm for a long time, but clunky parking boots are a hassle to deal with, both for traffic enforcers and car owners. 


Fox News reports that the task could prove easier with a new parking enforcement device called the Barnacle, a lightweight plastic device that immobilizes a car by blocking the driver&#x2019;s line of sight. The Barnacle comes equipped with two commercial-grade suction cups that allow it to latch on to car windshields, and is attached in place using a pump and lock.


Secured by over 750 pounds of force, the Barnacle is virtually impossible to pry off. It&#x2019;s also sensitive to movement, and sounds an alarm when a car is used while it&#x2019;s still attached.


To safely remove it, drivers pay their parking fines over the phone, and are given a code to release the device.


They then have 24 hours to return the Barnacle to the parking authority, or risk being charged with an additional fine.</description>

      <title>Self-driving buses: Singapore announces plan to start testing autonomous buses in 2018</title>
      <description>SINGAPORE &#x2014; Singapore announced on Wednesday that the country will begin testing autonomous buses on the road in 2018.


The trial is a joint effort between the city state&#x2019;s Land Transport Authority and Nanyang Technological University. 


Two existing electric hybrid buses will be equipped with various sensors including lidar, high sensitivity cameras, radar and GPS receivers, according to a news release by the LTA. 


The autonomous system allows the buses to detect obstacles and lanes in order to navigate through traffic.


The test route is about 1km long, between Nanyang Technology University and CleanTech Park in Jurong, in the west of the island. The buses can be recharged at bus stops along their route, which takes about 30 seconds.


Singapore began testing driverless taxis in August.One of the self-driving cars collided with a truck on Tuesday, according to reports. No one was injured in the accident.</description>

      <title>D.B. Cooper mystery: 45 years on, skyjacker who stole $200,000 remains an enigma</title>
      <description>SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  &#x2014; It&#x2019;s almost 45 years since a hijacker known by the pseudonym &#x201C;D.B. Cooper&#x201D; jumped out of plane above America&#x2019;s Pacific Northwest clutching a $200,000 cash ransom.
 
More than four decades later, the crime has never been solved and the FBI stopped actively investigating the case in July.
 
The legend of D.B. Cooper began at the Northwest Orient Airlines flight counter at Portland International Airport on Nov. 24, 1971, when a man identifying himself as &#x201C;Dan Cooper&#x201D; paid cash for a one-way ticket on Flight 305 to Seattle, a mere 30-minute journey.
 
 
On board, Cooper showed a flight attendant an explosive device in his briefcase and demanded $200,000 in cash, four parachutes, and a fuel truck on standby at the airport in Seattle.
 
The plane landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, where a bag filled with cash and parachutes was delivered, and Cooper released all 36 passengers, along with two flight attendants.
 
The plane took off again, bound for Mexico City, scheduled to stop to refuel in Reno, Nevada.
 
As Cooper sat alone in the cabin, crew members in the cockpit noticed a sudden upward tilt in the plane&#x2019;s tail section, which required trimming to get the aircraft back to its flight level. Investigators believe this could be the moment D.B. Cooper made his exit by leaping into the freezing cold air, through the clouds, and to an unknown fate.
  
In all the years that have followed, only two pieces of hard evidence have ever been found. In 1978, a hunter found the fragment of a placard for lowering the back stairs of a Boeing 727 along the flight path of the plane.
 
Two years later, about 20 miles southwest of Ariel, Washington a boy discovered $5,800 in damaged cash from Cooper&#x2019;s haul.
   
The FBI has investigated more than a thousand suspects in the case, but has never been able to identify D.B. Cooper. The bureau officially ended active investigation of the case in July, citing a lack of new information.
 
More than $194,000, the equivalent of more than a million dollars today, has never been recovered.
 
The FBI suspects that D.B. Cooper didn&#x2019;t survive the jump, but their guess about what really happened is as good as yours or mine.</description>

      <title>Amazon patents pocket-sized voice-controlled drone that perches on your shoulder</title>
      <description>ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA  &#x2014; Amazon is working on a pocket-sized drone that could revolutionize police work, help firefighters tackle blazes, and even find your lost car.


The tech giant was granted a U.S. patent on Tuesday for a miniature drone that would be fitted with microphones and a camera, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.


The drone would respond to voice commands, and has several potential functions. It could be used to find a missing child through face recognition, an RFID tag, or barcode on the child&#x2019;s clothing.


Amazon also imagines the pocket-sized drones may help the police catch suspects. It could hover above traffic stops to record interactions between officers and citizens.


Firefighters could also use the drones to identify people trapped in burning buildings, or equip the devices with thermal imaging cameras to locate fire &#x201C;hot spots&#x201D;.


The technology may be used in search and rescue missions, for example, to find a downed airliner.


Civilian uses include finding your car when you forget where you parked, or simply filming cool stuff like a GoPro.</description>

      <title>BMW unveils its motorcycle of the future, the Motorrad Vision Next 100</title>
      <description>SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; BMW revealed its latest concept motorcycle in Santa Monica, California on Oct. 12 as part of celebrations of its 100th birthday.


The Motorrad Vision Next 100 sports a self-balancing feature which BMW says eliminates the need for protective gear &#x2014; including a helmet.


What BMC calls a &#x201C;digital companion&#x201D; offers riding information and guidance to the rider. Should the system detect danger and if no action is taken by the rider, the digital companion will kick in and make the necessary corrective maneuvers.


The digital companion appears as a heads-up display in an augmented reality visor paired with the motorcycle. Data enters the rider&#x2019;s field of view when called upon. If the rider looks straight ahead, no information is displayed.


The concept also includes clothing inspired by muscle cords that actively supports the rider. The clothes are equipped with vibrating elements on the arms and legs that act as indicators should the bike lean too far in one direction.


The Motorrad Vision Next 100 concept design was on display in Los Angeles through Oct. 19.</description>

      <title>Solar powered road panels light up the streets, display signs on the road</title>
      <description>SANDPOINT, IDAHO &#x2014; A startup developing solar-powered road panels has recently finished its first public installation in the City of Sandpoint, Idaho.


The solar road panels, developed by Solar Roadways, are made of tempered glass and contain LED lights. The glass is strong enough to support the weight of semitrailers.


The panels are equipped with microprocessors, which allow them to communicate with each other, a control station, and vehicles. They also have heating elements that can prevent the accumulation of ice and snow on the road&#x2019;s surface.


The solar road panels can generate enough power to light up and provide power for nearby restrooms.


According to New Atlas, the second public installation of the solar road panels will be in Conway Missouri, at a rest stop along Route 66.</description>

      <title>Solar panel windows: coating of quantum dots on windows harvest energy from the sun</title>
      <description>LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO &#x2014; Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico have developed a film of quantum dots that can turn windows into photovoltaic systems.


Quantum dots can be used as semiconductors. According to IEEE Spectrum, they consist of a CdSe inner core, a Cd1&#x2212;xZnxS outer shell and a silica coating that prevents them from oxidation. The quantum dots are spead into a thin sheet that can be placed onto a glass window pane.


When photons from sunlight hit a quantum dot, it sends the electron in the valence band into the conduction band, leaving a hole behind. When the electron recombines with the hole in the valence band, a new photon with lower energy is generated.


This new photon propagates within the glass via internal reflections. Energy is then generated when the propagating photons reach the window frame, where solar cells are stored.


The coating of quantum dots can be used on any window and to turn it into a sunlight harvesters at costs lower than are currently available.


The study was published in Nature Energy on Oct 10.</description>

      <title>Two cave divers die in underwater Florida labyrinth known as &#x2018;Mount Everest of diving&#x2019;</title>
      <description>WEEKI WACHEE, FLORIDA &#x2014; Two divers died exploring an underwater cave system in Florida known to be one of the world&#x2019;s most beautiful, but also most dangerous diving sites.


The bodies of Patrick Peacock, 53, and Chris Rittenmeyer, 38, were found by rescue divers in the Eagle&#x2019;s Nest cave system on Monday, NBC affiliate WFLA reported.


Eagle&#x2019;s Nest is also known as the Lost Sink. Divers access the underwater caves through a pond in the Chassahowitzka Wildlife Refuge.


Among divers, the caves are considered the Mount Everest or Grand Canyon of diving sites for their stunning views and extreme depths. The treacherous tunnels contain around a mile of passages, some of them more than 300 feet deep.


Peacock and Rittenmeyer explored deep into the caves on Sunday, while a third diver, Justin Blakely, stayed nearer the surface.


Blakely raised the alarm when his two friends failed to show up on time at their meeting point.


The two dead divers were found in a complex and dangerous part of the cave system, according to deputies. They are the ninth and tenth divers to die at Eagle&#x2019;s Nest since 1981.


Both men were experienced cave divers and had explored the site before.


Florida man Chester Spivey, whose son and grandson died at Eagle&#x2019;s Nest on Christmas Day 2013, renewed calls for the site to be closed in the wake of Peacock and Rittenmeyer&#x2019;s deaths.</description>

      <title>Yondr case locks up phones during concert to prevent people from recording performances</title>
      <description>SAN FRANCISCO &#x2014; A company called Yondr has created a way of preventing concert-goers from using their phones at performance venues.


Before entering a performance venue, attendees would place their cellphones inside a Yondr case. The attendees would be in possession of the Yondr cases at all time, but would not be able to open them to access their phones while they&#x2019;re located inside the concert venue.


To access their phones, the attendees must step outside the concert venue and unlock the Yondr cases at unlock stations.</description>

      <title>Bali bridge collapse: At least 8 killed, dozens injured as bridge crashes into sea</title>
      <description>DENPASAR, INDONESIA &#x2014; At least eight people died and 30 more were injured when a bridge collapsed near the Indonesian resort island of Bali on Sunday.


The rickety yellow suspension bridge connected the small islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan off Bali&#x2019;s southeast coast.


The bridge was packed with motorbikes and people because of a Hindu ceremony at a nearby temple, BBC News reported.


The overloaded structure shook and collapsed, with some victims falling into the sea.


Although the water was only 2 meters deep, some victims were crushed by debris. 


Earlier reports said nine people were killed, but officials revised the figure. Three children were reportedly among the dead.


It was not immediately clear if anyone was missing.</description>

      <title>Space travel: Can the human body handle the long journey to Mars?</title>
      <description>MARS &#x2014; In a recent opinion article on CNN.com, U.S. President Barack Obama stressed his goal of not only sending humans to Mars, but making it possible for extended stay by 2030.


Obama praised NASA for building the groundwork in American space travel and lauded the private sector, which has grown exponentially in the past few years. He also announced that the government is working with commercial partners to make it possible to travel to and stay on Mars.


But the journey alone won&#x2019;t be an easy one. From what scientists already know about space travel, it can have harmful effects on the human body.


According to James A. Pawelczyk, Ph.D. &#x2014; an physiology and kinesiology researcher, who served as a payload specialist aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1998 &#x2014; one of the dangers of space travel is exposure to radiation.


In a 2005 article written for Penn State&#x2019;s website, Pawelczyk described solar rays passing through metal as something akin to rain passing through chicken wire. Without the protection of Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere, humans are vulnerable to the sun&#x2019;s gamma rays and hot neutrons, which can cause cancer. 


There are two ways to deal with solar radiation during space travel. The first is to create a shield to absorb the radiation and protect the human body.


Pawelczyk noticed on the Russian space station Mir, astronauts slept with their heads near large lead batteries to shield themselves from the rays. Lead is a great absorber of gamma radiation. Another excellent shield is water, according to Pawelczyk, for its high hydrogen concentration. Water in its densest form, ice, provides even more absorption of gamma rays. And the thicker the shield, the better the absorption and protection.
Another alternative to avoiding radiation is to decrease the amount of time spent in space. In other words, finding a quicker form of transportation.


During space travel, humans are also prone to osteoporosis. Astronauts in space have been recorded losing one to two percent of bone mass per month. During a round trip to Mars, which takes about a year, 10 to 25 percent of skeletal mass could be lost. Pawelczyk equates this to being bedridden for about 10 to 15 years.


On Mars, after months and months without gravity, space traveler&#x2019;s bones and muscles may not be able to support their own body weight on Earth. While exercise aboard spacecrafts might help retain muscle and bone mass, astronauts have suffered massive loss.


Space causes other complications as well, including alterations to the circulatory system and the immune system.


Once on Mars, people will battle with lower temperatures. As Mars is farther away from the sun than Earth, the average temperature is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and can vary from minus 195 degrees F near the poles during the winter to as much as 70 degrees F at midday near the equator.


Mars&#x2019; thin and low pressure atmosphere also means little oxygen and very dusty conditions. The atmosphere of Mars is about 100 times thinner than Earth&#x2019;s and is 95percent carbon dioxide. Furthermore, without adequate protection, Mars&#x2019; low pressure atmosphere would cause, skin and organs to rupture within minutes, leading to a quick and painful death.</description>

      <title>Thailand&#x2019;s much-loved king dies, Crown Prince of Darkness prepares to take the throne</title>
      <description>BANGKOK &#x2014; Thailand&#x2019;s revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on Thursday, aged 88, after 70 years on the throne. He was the world&#x2019;s longest-reigning monarch.


The government immediately ordered all flags to fly at half-mast and told citizens to wear black for 30 days, the Guardian reported.


An official mourning period will last for one year, during which big events like music concerts will be postponed. Alcohol sales will be restricted and bars and restaurants will close or shorten their opening hours.


Thailand expects a record 33 million tourists this year, and it remains to be seen how the mourning period will impact the tourist industry. However, Britain&#x2019;s Foreign Office warned in a travel advisory that visitors should behave respectfully when in public areas.
 
King Bhumibol will be succeeded by his only son, the far less popular Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn.


The 64-year-old king-in-waiting is a divisive figure in the country, where he has a reputation for womanizing and engaging in bizarre and sometimes cruel behavior, according to the Guardian.


A video, which is banned in Thailand, shows the crown prince holding a weird birthday party for his pet poodle Foo Foo in 2007. The prince granted Foo Foo, who sadly died last year, the rank of air chief marshal in the Royal Thai Air Force.


More recent photos of the thrice-married prince show him in Germany, where he spends most his time shacked up with a former Thai Airways stewardess. He is wearing a boob tube and covered in tattoos.


Of course you can&#x2019;t say any of this in Thailand, where it&#x2019;s a criminal offense to insult the royal family, subject to 15 years in jail.</description>

      <title>U.S. Navy fires Tomahawk missiles at Yemen after taking fire from Iran-backed Houthis</title>
      <description>SANAA, YEMEN &#x2014; The U.S. Navy fired three missiles at Yemen on Thursday, in Washington&#x2019;s first direct military assault against Iran-backed Houthi forces.


The Pentagon stressed that the strikes were a retaliatory measure, after a U.S. ship in the Red Sea was earlier targeted by missiles from Houthi-controlled territory. 


The USS Nitze destroyer fired three Tomahawk missiles at around 4 a.m., Reuters reported. The strikes were aimed at three coastal radar sites, which had enabled the earlier Houthi missile attacks.


The Pentagon was keen to point out that the radar sites were in remote areas and the chance of civilian casualties was low.


The radar sites were used to launch at least three coastal cruise missiles against the USS Mason on Sunday and Wednesday.


The Houthis are fighting the internationally recognized government of Yemen and currently hold the capital city Sanaa.


They&#x2019;ve denied launching any strikes against U.S. ships and said the allegations were a ruse designed to escalate aggression against the Yemeni people.


The U.S. warned that it would respond to any threat against its Navy or commercial ships in the area.</description>

      <title>Kratom: DEA reverses plan to ban plant after internet outcry</title>
      <description>WASHINGTON &#x2014; The United States Drug Enforcement Administration is reversing its decision to ban the use of kratom after a public outcry.


According to NPR, kratom is derived from a plant in southeast Asia, which is related to coffee plants. It is often purchased in the form of capsule filled with powdered leaf or made into tea.


The drug is said to have been able to help curing addiction to opiates or alcohol and can cure intractable pain. Although the drug is said to be rather mild, it can cause side effects including nausea, sweating, respiratory depression and hallucinations, according to Narconon.


Kratom is legal in Canada and the United Kingdom. It is prohibited in Thailand, Malaysia, Burma and Australia.


The DEA announced in August that it planned to place kratom in schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act, which includes heroin and LSD. It has received numerous oppositions from the public since the announcement.</description>

      <title>East Hartford plane crash: Jordanian student pilot &#x2018;crashed plane deliberately&#x2019;</title>
      <description>EAST HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT &#x2014; Investigators believe a twin-engine plane that crashed on a street in a suburban Connecticut town was deliberately taken down.


The Piper PA-34 Seneca plane tore through power lines before catching fire and plunging into the ground in East Hartford on Tuesday.


Student Feras Freitekh, a Jordanian national, was killed. Flying instructor Arian Prevalla, originally from Albania, survived with serious burns.


Prevalla told investigators the two men had a heated exchange before his student intentionally sent the plane spiralling toward the ground, the New York Times reported.


The plane burst into a fireball just yards from a minivan loaded with passengers, but amazingly there were no further casualties.


The plane crashed near aerospace defense contractor Pratt &amp; Whitney, which local police called &#x201C;critical infrastructure.&#x201D; 


Based on the flying instructor&#x2019;s account, the FBI has taken over the case and federal agents are now trying to establish a motive.


They are investigating whether Freitekh had mental health problems and was trying to commit suicide.


Family members in Jordan said 28-year-old Freitekh dreamed of becoming a pilot and was not at all religious, so religion wasn&#x2019;t an issue, according to the New York Times.</description>

      <title>Police tracked protests using social media monitoring program Geofeedia</title>
      <description>SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; A social media monitoring program that has been boasting its surveillance feature for law enforcement has had its access to social media data limited following a report by the American Civil Liberties Union. 


According to the report, the program, Geofeedia, is being used by police around the country to target minorities without public knowledge. 


Primarily focused on providing data about rallies and protests, Geofeedia has given location-based information to law enforcement who have subscribed to its services. The problem is most of the law enforcement agencies have not told the public about its use of Geofeedia for surveillance, which has led to what the ACLU believes is an &#x201C;utter lack of transparency, accountability and oversight.&#x201D;  


Furthermore, the ACLU believes that the use of Geofeedia has been biased. 


&#x201C;Our records show that Geofeedia&#x2019;s marketing materials, for instance, refer to unions and activist groups as &#x2018;overt threats,&#x2019; and suggest the product can be used in ways that target activists of color,&#x201D; the ACLU of Northern California reported.


The ACLU of Northern California obtained emails between Geofeedia and local authorities, in which the Geofeedia representative wrote in one instance of using the program to monitor the &#x201C;Ferguson situation,&#x201D; and in another instance of &#x201C;stay[ing] ahead of rioters.&#x201D;


The program relies on API provided by social media sites including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Based on information made public by users, the social networks provided feeds that allowed Geofeedia to tap into user&#x2019;s locations and activities.


When a user publishes a public post on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, and provides their location, Geofeedia was able to access those posts and provide its content to its subscribers.


Geofeedia&#x2019;s subscribers can search for social media posts by location by inputting an address or drawing parameters on a map. Subscribers can further narrow their search results by including key terms or phrases.


Neither Facebook nor Instagram has a public policy specifically prohibiting developers from exploiting user data for surveillance purposes. Facebook&#x2019;s platform policy prohibits the selling, transfer and sublicense of its codes, APis or tools. And developers are not permitted to put Facebook data into any search engines or directories without the social network&#x2019;s explicit permission.


Twitter prohibits the sale of user data for surveillance as well as a Developer Policy that bans the use of Twitter data &#x201C;to investigate, track or surveil Twitter users.&#x201D;


Following the release of ACLU&#x2019;s report, Instagram cut off Geofeedia&#x2019;s access to public user posts, and Facebook has cut its access to a topic-based feed of public user posts. Twitter suspended Geofeedia&#x2019;s commercial access to data.</description>

      <title>Solar panel windows: coating of quantum dots on windows harvest energy from the sun</title>
      <description>LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO &#x2014; Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico have developed a film of quantum dots that can turn windows into photovoltaic systems.


Quantum dots can be used as semiconductors. According to IEEE Spectrum, they consist of a CdSe inner core, a Cd1&#x2212;xZnxS outer shell and a silica coating that prevents them from oxidation. The quantum dots are spead into a thin sheet that can be placed onto a glass window pane.


When photons from sunlight hit a quantum dot, it sends the electron in the valence band into the conduction band, leaving a hole behind. When the electron recombines with the hole in the valence band, a new photon with lower energy is generated.


This new photon propagates within the glass via internal reflections. Energy is then generated when the propagating photons reach the window frame, where solar cells are stored.


The coating of quantum dots can be used on any window and to turn it into a sunlight harvesters at costs lower than are currently available.


The study was published in Nature Energy on Oct 10.</description>

      <title>Exploding ISIS drone kills two Kurdish fighters, injures French special forces in Iraq</title>
      <description>MOSUL, IRAQ &#x2014; Two Kurdish fighters were killed and two French paratroops injured this week when a small ISIS-controlled drone exploded after being intercepted. A Kurdish defence spokesperson told Reuters the device has been booby-trapped.


On October 2, in an area north of the ISIS-controlled Iraqi city of Mosul, a small weaponized drone shot down by Kurdish soldiers and a special operations unit from France. The troops brought the drone back to base to examine it. As they were dismantling it, the drone exploded. A small, powerful explosive is believed to have been hidden inside the drone, disguised as a battery.


Two Kurdish soldiers were killed in the blast, and two members of the French special forces were badly injured. It remains unclear whether the bomb was remotely detonated, or was designed as a timed explosive. The drone used was likely a small, commercial commonly used by amateur drone pilots.


The weaponized drone attack is being reported as the first to successfully cause death.</description>

      <title>Project Blue unveiled to capture first picture of habitable exoplanet in Alpha Centauri</title>
      <description>NEW YORK &#x2014; Private investors Mission Centaur and the BoldlyGo Institute have partnered to launch Project Blue, a plan to build a compact space telescope that has aims of capturing an image of a potential Earth-like exoplanet orbiting the closest star system to us in the Milky Way galaxy.


Project Blue&#x2019;s half-meter-wide telescope is expected to be sent into orbit in roughly three years. It&#x2019;s high-contrast imaging is designed to take pictures of our closest neighboring star system, Alpha Centauri. Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light years away from our solar system.


Scientists estimate there is an 85% probability that Alpha Centauri&#x2019;s sun-like stars have an Earth-like planet somewhere in their habitable zones. If a planet orbiting within the habitable zones is detected with an atmosphere that could allow liquid water to exist on its surface, it may appear as a blue dot in the telescope.</description>

      <title>China buildings collapse: at least 22 killed as four buildings collapse in Wenzhou city</title>
      <description>WENZHOU, CHINA &#x2014; Four residential buildings in Chinese city of Wenzhou, mostly occupied by migrant workers, collapsed on Monday and killed at least 22 people.


The collapsed buildings were part of an urban village, which is a term used to refer to the housing facilities of poor quality occupied by migrant workers in cities. The buildings were only supposed to be three storeys high but were illegally constructed to six storeys. According to Beijing News, the building materials were mostly concrete bricks, wooden sticks and boards, without any steel structures.


According to China Daily, continued rainfall in Wenzhou may have contributed to the collapse, as well as the unstable foundation.


A person living opposite to the collapsed buildings told Beijing News that his room shook violently just moments before the crash. He then ran to the window in time to see the structures collapse completely.


The collapsed buildings were located in a neighborhood that local government and property developers have tried to demolish and renew since 2014. Some residents reportedly refused to move, as they were trying to negotiate higher compensation from the local government.</description>

      <title>UK scientists develop gene therapy to treat early stages of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease</title>
      <description>LONDON &#x2014; Researchers from Imperial College London have developed a gene therapy that has successfully prevented the development of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease in mice.


To treat the disease, scientists created a modified a virus using a lentivirus vector in order to target specific cells. This modified virus also contained a gene called PGC1-alpha, which is said to prevent the formation of amyloid-beta peptide, a protein that causes amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaques are commonly found in the brains of those with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, and are said to cause brain cell death.


The modified virus was delivered directly into the brains of mice suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer&#x2019;s.


Lab results showed the mice with the PGC1-alpha gene developed very few amyloid plaques, while the untreated mice had multiple plagues after four months.


The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</description>

      <title>New York&#x2019;s JFK airport tests software designed for a smoother passenger experience</title>
      <description>NEW YORK &#x2014; Software designed to reduce queues and ensure a smooth experience for passengers has gone on trial at Terminal 4 of New York&#x2019;s JFK airport.


The Beontra system pulls information from the Airport Operational Database. 
This includes passenger profiles, flight schedules, and real-time info on data such as adverse weather conditions.


The system uses the data to produce a graph, showing when waiting times will peak at airport bottlenecks, Wired reported.


This information is shared with airlines, immigration, and security officials, so they can deploy enough staff to handle the volume of passengers moving through the airport.


Currently the system displays passenger forecasts for today and the next two days, but can potentially provide forecasts up to 90 days in advance.


The system is used by more than 30 airports in Europe and Asia, and JFK is the first U.S. airport to test it.


Around 20 million passengers pass through JFK&#x2019;s Terminal 4 each year, hopefully with fewer delays from now on.</description>

      <title>Solar power South Africa: George airport runs entirely on energy garnered from the sun</title>
      <description>GEORGE, SOUTH AFRICA &#x2014; The South African city of George is home to Africa&#x2019;s first &#x2014; and world&#x2019;s second &#x2014; fully operational solar powered airport.


George Airport last September became powered entirely by solar energy. According to an AFP article used by France24, this move lowered its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 1000 tonnes. 


The hub runs on energy garnered by some 2,000 solar panels. These power everything from the ATMs, restaurants to the check-in desk and airport control tower.  Excess energy is transferred to nearby homes and other places a local power grid. 


South Africa is already developing two other solar powered airports in the city of Kimberly and town of Upington.</description>

      <title>MIT researchers create 3D-printed viscoelastic robot &#x2018;skin&#x2019;</title>
      <description>CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS &#x2014; Researchers at MIT&#x2019;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have developed a 3D-printed &#x201C;skin&#x201D; for robots that acts as a shock absorber. The skin protects robots and helps make their movements more precise. 


The skin is made of a &#x201C;programmable viscoelastic material&#x201D; (PVM). Unlike purely elastic substances, a viscoelastic substance has an elastic component and a viscous component. Viscoelastics are able to dissipate or dampen energy where elastics cannot.


The team found that by 3D-printing the skin, they are able to manipulate its elasticity by altering the amount of liquid material inside the layers. Printing was also the most affordable method of manipulation.


Researchers tested the skin on their cube robot that moves by bouncing. The team used a solid, a liquid and a flexible rubber-like material called TangoBlack+ to print both the cube and its skins.


They found that the robot with the more elastic skin was able to bounce higher and land with more precision. 


The work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation.</description>

      <title>Hairy wetsuit! MIT develops beaver-inspired wetsuit</title>
      <description>CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS&#x2014; Inspired by hairy semiaquatic mammals like beavers and sea otters, researchers at MIT are developing a new kind of material for wetsuit, fabricated from the pelts of beavers and otters to improve swimmers&#x2019; insulation.


Led by MIT professor Anette Hosoi, the team fabricated fur-like pelts to study how beavers and sea otters stay warm while diving underwater. During the study, the team submerged the pelts in silicone oil to observe the formation of air pockets. 


The result shows that the fabricated pelts with thicker fur that were plunged at higher speeds generally retained a thicker layer of air within their fur.</description>

      <description>NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY &#x2014; Pharma giant Johnson &amp; Johnson is warning diabetic patients that hackers could exploit a security flaw in one of its devices to deliver a lethal dose of insulin.


The Johnson &amp; Johnson OneTouch Ping system delivers insulin through a catheter. The device is sold with a wireless remote control.


The system is vulnerable to hacking because the signal from the remote control to the device is not encrypted, Reuters reported.


Tests by the company confirmed that hackers could order the device to pump insulin from a distance of up to 25 feet.


Johnson &amp; Johnson advised concerned patients not to use the remote control and to program the pump to limit the maximum insulin dose.


In a letter to patients, the company stressed that the threat from hacking was minimal as hackers would require sophisticated equipment and proximity to the pump. It added that no hacking attempts had been reported by the 114,000 patients who use the device in the U.S. and Canada.


Diabetic patients use insulin pumps to control blood sugar levels. Giving a patient too much insulin could cause low blood sugar, which in some cases may prove fatal.</description>

      <title>Fracking vs. microwave extraction: New tech could be the future of oil production</title>
      <description>GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO &#x2014;  Oil industry experts in the United States are developing a technology to beam microwaves into shale rock in order to extract oil.


Oil shale is found in more shallow formations, which contains solid organic material called kerogen. Oil can be extracted from oil shale after subjecting it to high heat.
Peter Kearl, co-founder and Chiech Technology Officer of Qmast, a Colorado-based company pioneering the use of the microwave tech explained the method to Ozy.com: a microwave beam as powerful as 500 household microwave ovens would be used to extract the oil from oil shale. Once the microwave reaches the oil shale, it would heat up the water in the rock and turn them into steam, which would help releasing the oil. The rock would become transparent after the oil and water has been removed, which allows the microwave beam to penetrate further.


According to Ozy.com, a single microwave extraction well could produce about 800,000 barrels of oil. This technology might also produce water while extracting oil with the amount of one barrel of water for every three barrels of oil produced.


The Daily Caller reported that microwave extraction technology would have major environmental advantages but would only be about 20 percent more expensive than conventional methods. 


Qmast is currently planned to deployed in 2017 and is expected to start producing oil by the end of that year, Ozy.com reported.</description>

      <title>Avatar XPRIZE challenge: $22m competition aims to make avatars a reality</title>
      <description>TOKYO &#x2014; The next wave of animatronics is on the horizon. The Avatar XPRIZE challenge, sponsored by Japanese airline All Nippon Airways (ANA), is currently underway and will conclude in 2022 with a &#x201C;no limits&#x201D; Olympic-type competition. 


The challenge asks teams to come up a means to instantaneous and limitless transportation to further expand the reaches of communication. A prize of $22 million will be awarded to the winning team that can develop a system that teleports one&#x2019;s consciousness into a physical avatar body, which will enable people to instantly be in multiple places at once.


Professor Susumu Tachi from the University of Tokyo&#x2019;s Tachi Lab has already demonstrated a workable avatar called the Telesar V, which stands for Telexistence Surrogate Anthropomorphic Robot. The bare-bones avatar was synced to one of Tachi&#x2019;s students and interacted with the professor during a recent demonstration.


Hiroshi Ishiguro from Osaka University&#x2019;s Intelligent Robotics Laboratory also recently presented his robot. The robot, named &#x201C;U,&#x201D; was dressed as a flight attendant and appeared rather lifelike. U was even capable of making facial expressions and smiled during the demonstration.


XPRIZE and ANA hope that the challenge will give birth new ways of traveling, allowing people to not only experience new areas without the time spent on commuting, but to also be able to conduct business, according to the competition&#x2019;s official website.


In 2022, each team&#x2019;s avatar will compete in the Avatar Games, by conducting a series of activities based on different jobs. For example, they will act as a caretaker and push a wheelchair; shake hands as a public speaker, and play tennis against a trained athlete.</description>

      <title>Smart bandage that tells you when to change earns girl, 13, Google Science Fair prize</title>
      <description>BEAVERTON, OREGON &#x2014; A smart bandage that detects moisture levels and signals when it needs to be changed has helped a seventh grade student impress the judges at the Google Science Fair.


Anushka Naiknaware, 13, is a student at Stoller Middle School in Beaverton, Oregon. Her invention finished in the top eight at the competition, according to the event&#x2019;s official website. 


Naiknaware won a $15,000 scholarship and a free trip to Lego headquarters in Denmark, with a year of entrepreneurship mentoring from a Lego executive.


The bandage uses biopolymer chitosan with carbon nanoparticles to reduce bleeding and measure moisture levels in the wound. A battery and bluetooth chip sit on top of the bandage and are covered by a regular bandage adhesive layer.


When the moisture level is high, the electrons inside the bandage experience less resistance; when the bandage dries up, the electrons detect much higher resistance. 


The change in resistance is noted and can be wirelessly transmitted to a mobile device, which then prompts the user to change bandages.</description>

      <title>Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall: Replacement smartphone smokes, forces airplane evacuation</title>
      <description>LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY &#x2014; Smoke coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone forced an airplane evacuation at Louisville International Airport on Wednesday morning.


Passenger Brian Green turned off his Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after he boarded the flight when the device began emitting smoke, Reuters reported. The phone reportedly became so warm that it burned a hole in the plane&#x2019;s carpet. 


The smoking phone prompted the crew to evacuate 75 passengers through the main cabin door. No one was injured during the incident.


Green&#x2019;s wife explained to Reuters that he replaced the original phone two weeks ago following a message from Samsung. 


Last month the company issued a worldwide recall of the devices due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire.</description>

      <title>Panasonic unveils crazy new device that transmits data through human touch</title>
      <description>CHIBA, JAPAN &#x2014; Japanese tech giant Panasonic this week unveiled a prototype device that transmits data via human touch. 


The technology was on display at the Ceatec Japan 2016 electronics show in the city of Chiba, near Tokyo, PC World reported. 


The data is sent through a radio field on human skin. The technology is safe, as the currents don&#x2019;t flow inside the body


For example, a person with a transmitter can send data, such as a color code, to a lamp with a sensor. The lamp can then change its color to match the code.


Panasonic predicts the data transmission system could have more practical uses in the future, such as exchanging contact information via handshake, or unlocking doors by just a touch.


The technology is currently too big for practical use, but Panasonic is confident it can make the device as small as needed, if there is demand for the system.</description>

      <title>Former IndyCar racer, quadriplegic Sam Schmidt gets license to drive semi-autonomous car</title>
      <description>DENVER &#x2014; Late last month, former IndyCar racer Sam Schmidt became the first man in the U.S. to receive a semi-autonomous driver&#x2019;s license. 


Schmidt lost control of his arms and legs during a practice lap in 2000. In September, Nevada Lieutenant Governor Mark Hutchison awarded Schmidt the first restricted license in the country to drive a semi-autonomous car.


One of Schmidt&#x2019;s sponsors, Arrow Electronics, had modified a 2014 Corvette Z06 with technology that will allow him to control the car without the use of his limbs.


The car, aptly nicknamed the Arrow SAM Car &#x2014; SAM as in semi-autonomous motorcar  &#x2014; is equipped with a voice command system, infrared camera system, a breath manipulation system, GPS technology and 4G-LTE connectivity.


Voice commands allow Schmidt to turn the car off and on and change gears.


Infrared cameras mounted on the car&#x2019;s dashboard pick up sensors mounted onto a hat, which Schmidt wears when driving. When Schmidt turns his head, the infrared camera system picks up the motion and translates it into steering. 


To control acceleration and braking, a sip/puff system has been installed. A breathing apparatus allows Schmidt to accelerate the car by blowing air into a tube. To engage the brakes, Schmidt sucks air out of the tube. Pressure sensors send signals to the car. 


GPS technology provides additional guidance assistance. Using sensors on the back of the car, the system will keep the car within 1.5 meters of the edge of the road or track. Schmidt has a virtual envelope of about 10 meters wide within which he can steer.


An overall safety system ensures that signals sent by Schmidt are properly translated into the car&#x2019;s movements.


The car is also linked to an Arrow 4G-LTE gateway that runs Windows 10 Enterprise on an Intel server. The Arrow 4G-LTE collects, streams and stores API-accessible data in Microsoft&#x2019;s Azure cloud service.


The license requires Schmidt to have a passenger inside the vehicle at all times. As a result, Arrow has equipped the car with a pilot control option that allows the passenger to take over driving if necessary. 


Additionally, the license calls for a pilot car to be driven in front of the Arrow SAM Car at all times, acting as a barrier between Schmidt and other drivers on the road. In emergency cases where the pilot driver isn&#x2019;t able to gain control, the Arrow SAM Car could run into the pilot vehicle.


Schmidt was able to attain 152 mph in the car at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May and drove the Pikes Peak International in June.</description>

      <title>Save the bees: Hawaiian yellow-faced bees added to U.S. endangered species list</title>
      <description>HONOLULU &#x2014; The U.S. government has added seven species of Hawaiian bees to the endangered species list, making them the first bee species to be protected under the Endangered Species Act.


The seven endangered species of bees are Hylaeus anthracinus, Hylaeus longiceps, Hylaeus assimulans, Hylaeus facilis, Hylaeus hilaris, Hylaeus kuakea and Hylaeus mana. They live in many habits on the Hawaii islands, including coastlines, wet and dry forests and shrublands.


According to the Xerces Society, the Hawaiian bees are threatened by urbanization, fire, wild animals such as pigs, and invasive ants and plant species.


Bees are disappearing at an alarming rate on the mainland U.S. as well, with 20 to 40 percent of honeybee colonies collapsing every winter, the Science Alert reported.


Bees are vital to human beings as they are one of the world&#x2019;s major pollinators. Without the bees pollinating, about 30 percent of the world&#x2019;s crops and 90 percent of wild plants would die.</description>

      <description>SAN FRANCISCO &#x2014; Yahoo has been secretly scanning millions of its customers&#x2019; emails for U.S. intelligence, according to a Reuters investigation.


Citing ex-employees and another source, Reuters reports that Yahoo was secretly scanning customer emails on orders from the FBI or NSA. The company reportedly tailored a program to search customers&#x2019; emails for set of characters. It&#x2019;s unknown whether Yahoo passed on any information.


Responding to the report, Yahoo told Reuters it was a &#x201C;law-abiding company&#x201D; that complies with U.S. law. Google and Microsoft, two of the world&#x2019;s largest and U.S.-based email providers, separately told the news agency that they hadn&#x2019;t conducted such searches.</description>

      <title>Massive river wave: How China&#x2019;s Qiantang River tidal bore is formed</title>
      <description>HAINING CITY, CHINA &#x2014; Each year during the eighth month of the lunar calendar, China&#x2019;s Qiantang River surges thanks to the gravitational pull of the moon. The wave&#x2019;s power has claimed people who got too close.


Waves have surged up the river as high as 30 feet tall. Throughout the years, many, who attempt to get close to the monstrous wave, have been swept away and even injured. 


Not all rivers experience tidal bores and not all have surges as large as that of the Qiantang river.


Tidal bores form along a coast where a river empties into the ocean or sea.  According to National Geographic, generally tidal bores form in rivers, like the Qiantang River, that are fairly shallow and narrow narrow until it meets the sea, where its estuary, is large and flat and its tidal range, the area between high tide and low tide, is at least 20 feet. The Qiantang River&#x2019;s estuary, the Hangzhou Bay, has the added bonus of being triangular allowing it to act like a funnel, which intensifies the Silver Dragon. 


When the gravitational pull of a full or new moon raises the water level at the river&#x2019;s mouth especially high, it triggers a wave that is funneled upstream. Tidal bores are exceptionally large when the sun crosses the celestial equator, during the equinoxes when the pull is greater. Based on the Qiantang River&#x2019;s location, this could be why the Silver Dragon only arrives once a year.


While most tidal bores can be predicted, the Silver Dragon rolled in on Sept. 18 this year, one day earlier than usual. Due to Typhoon Meranti and Malakas, the tidal bore this year is higher than those of previous years. According to the South China Morning Post, one man was knocked unconscious by the wave and pushed 16 feet before being rescued.</description>

      <title>Ocean Cleanup Foundation says Great Pacific Garbage Patch is worse than we thought</title>
      <description>MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA &#x2014; Initial results from the first aerial survey of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch suggest that ocean pollution is worse than we thought.


The Ocean Cleanup Foundation is conducting a series of aerial surveys over an area of plastic accumulation in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and California, according to a news release on its website.


Flying at low altitude and low speed, the survey uses Lidar technology to analyse the density and frequency of plastic ocean debris.


Recording the presence of debris larger than 0.5 meters by 1.5 meters, the crew found more than 1,000 pieces of plastic during a 2 &#xBD;-hour test flight.


The survey also aims to document discarded fishing nets known as &#x201C;ghost nets&#x201D;, which are difficult to detect and can ensnare marine life.


Researchers from the Great Ocean Cleanup said understanding the scope of the problem would help future efforts to remove trash from the Pacific.</description>

      <title>Hacking the human body: Researchers use human body to send wireless passwords securely</title>
      <description>SEATTLE &#x2014; University of Washington scientists have developed a way to transmit password data using the human body instead of via wireless air transmission.


The researchers used the fingerprint technology to transmit data through the body, reported Engadget. They say this could be used to perform security checks such as authentication for door locks.


According to Engadget, the technique uses trackpads and smartphone fingerprint sensors to send low-frequency electromagnetic transmissions through the body instead of the air. The researchers note that these on-body transmissions could also be used to send password information to wearable technology. 


The findings were presented last month in a paper at the 2016 Association for Computing Machinery&#x2019;s International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing.</description>

      <title>Kim Kardashian robbed at gunpoint in luxury Paris hotel</title>
      <description>PARIS &#x2014; Reality TV star Kim Kardashian was reportedly robbed at gunpoint in her luxury hotel in Paris on Monday morning, resulting in millions of dollars&#x2019; worth of jewelry being stolen from her.


Five masked robbers reportedly dressed in police uniforms entered the H&#xF4;tel de Pourtal&#xE8;s in the Eighth Arrondissement in Paris, where Kim Kardashian was staying. The hotel also known as the &#x201C;no address hotel,&#x201D; which is very popular among celebrities for its privacy.


According to the Wall Street Journal, the robbers first threatened the hotel&#x2019;s doorman, who led two of them upstairs and let them enter Kardashian's room. Kardashian, who was alone at the time, reportedly had a gun held to her head and was tied up and left in the bathroom.


The robbers took a box of jewelry and a ring together worth about 9 million Euros, as well as some cash and mobile phones.


Kardashian left Paris in a private jet after speaking to the local authorities about the robbery. Her husband, rapper Kanye West, abruptly ended a performance in New York after he was informed of the incident.</description>

      <title>Million man mission to mars: How Elon SpaceX will colonize Mars with 1 million people</title>
      <description>THE FINAL FRONTIER &#x2014;  Billionaire inventor Elon Musk this week unveiled perhaps his biggest, most ambitious plan yet &#x2014; colonizing the Red Planet with one million people.


According to a presentation posted on the SpaceX website, the planned &#x201C;Interplanetary Transport System&#x201D;, or I.T.S., would use a spacecraft composed of a 250-foot reuseable rocket and 100-passenger spaceship to transport humans back and forth to Mars.


Musk envisions a thousand-strong Mars colonial fleet of these ships departing en-masse, reported Space.com. He unveiled the plans while speaking to a crowd at the 2016 International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico.


Both parts of the ITS would be made up of carbon fiber, while the rocket would be powered by 42 SpaceX Raptor Engines.


The rocket booster segment of the ITS will transport the spaceship to low Earth orbit.
That same rocket would then return to Earth and launch again with a propellant tank. This tank then connects with the spaceship and refuel the vessel.


The spaceship would use nine Space-X Raptor engines, as well as solar sails, which gather energy from the sun, on the 54.6-million kilometer journey to Mars. After transporting the cargo and passengers, the spaceship would refuel at the planned Martian colony and fly back to Earth.


The current price-person for the journey is priced at US$10 billion, but Musk hopes to get that to below $200,000.</description>

      <title>Synthetic opioid epidemic in U.S. behind spike in drug overdoses</title>
      <description>NEW YORK &#x2014; An opioid epidemic is continuing to grow in the U.S. as extremely potent synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl, flood the market.


Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid affects the brain&#x2019;s limbic system, which controls emotions and feelings. Once consumed, the opioids attach to receptors in the brain to reduce the brain&#x2019;s perception of pain. However, these same receptors also control breathing and the digestive system. When opioids attach to these receptors, breathing is suppressed, eventually leading to respiratory failure.


Chemically manufactured opioids are not only more powerful but are also cheaper to produce than heroin, which has to be made from poppies. Drug dealers mix drugs like fentanyl with heroin to reduce the cost and to make the drug much stronger. Some synthetic opioids are so strong that merely touching or inhaling a very small amount can make someone seriously ill or even kill them.


Fentanyl and heroin have already killed 300 people in the U.S. this year. At this rate, they will kill double the number of people they killed in 2015.


According to the Wall Street Journal, dealers often purchase fentanyl or other synthetic opioids online from suppliers in China. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says China manufacturers most of the world's synthetic opioids.


The drugs are often shipped to traffickers in Mexico, where they are mixed with heroin before being smuggled into the U.S.</description>

      <title>Police shootings: Miami Beach cops replace old shotguns with less lethal beanbag rounds</title>
      <description>MIAMI BEACH &#x2014; Miami Beach cops are ditching their old school shotguns for ones that fire beanbags instead of bullets.


The new 12-gauge shotguns shoot beanbag rounds filled with lead shot and are designed to stop suspects in their tracks, not to kill, the Miami Herald reported.


Each round weighs about 40 grams, the same as a medium-sized egg.


Beanbag shotguns have an ideal range of 20 to 75 feet, which will help cops maintain greater distance from suspects than they can with a Taser. Tasers typically have a range of up to 12 feet. 


Miami Beach cops plan to use the new shotguns in situations where a suspect is emotionally disturbed or dangerous and a threat to himself or others.


The move to replace old shotguns with a less lethal version comes amid several high-profile deaths of suspects killed by police officers.


Although beanbag shotguns are less lethal, they can still cause severe injuries or fatalities, so officers will undergo six weeks of training to learn how to use them.</description>

      <title>New Clinton emails: FBI set to examine newly discovered emails days before US elections</title>
      <description>WASHINGTON &#x2014; With just over a week to go until the U.S. election on Nov. 8, Federal investigators last Friday announced the existence of new emails related to Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s private server.


The New York Times reports that the emails were discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner&#x2019;s illicit messages to an underage girl. 


On Oct. 3, the agency executed a search warrant to examine Weiner&#x2019;s iPhone, iPad and laptop. It was in the laptop &#x2014; which the former Congressman shared with ex-wife and Clinton aide Huma Abedin &#x2014; that agents found the emails.


FBI officials have since obtained a search warrant to review the emails pertaining to the Democratic Presidential candidate and will investigate whether they contained classified information.


It remains unclear how long the review process will take, but it will likely go beyond election day.</description>

      <title>AIDS immunity: Rare South African kids born with HIV but resistant to AIDS</title>
      <description>SOUTH AFRICA &#x2014; Scientists have discovered more than 100 African children who appear to be resistant to the human immunodeficiency virus.


Researchers found 170 HIV-infected children in South Africa who did not develop AIDS despite high levels of the virus in their blood, calling them non-progressors, according to a new study published in Science Translational Medicine.


The children, aged 5 and older, were infected in the womb, and remain healthy even without receiving antiviral treatment.


In most patients, HIV cripples the immune system by infecting CD4 T-cells that respond to the viral threat. Higher activation results in a more widespread infection, often leading to AIDS.


By contrast, low levels of immune activation are seen in non-progressors, whose weak immune systems did not engage the virus.


Their T-cells were found to have low levels of the receptor protein CCR5, on which the HIV virus attaches to enter the cell. Fewer particles get in, resulting in fewer cells dying.


The unique defense method basically renders the virus incapable of infecting target cells. It has previously been seen in monkeys.


A similar immunity is exhibited by a small percentage of adults called elite controllers, but in their case, mounting a strong immune response is the way to beat the virus.</description>

      <title>Floating underwater tunnels: Norway earmarks $25bn for floating submerged tunnel plan</title>
      <description>OSLO, NORWAY &#x2014; The Norwegian Public Roads Administration believes floating underwater tunnels could be the key to shorter driving times in the country.


Norway is home to more than 1,100 fjords, the deep glacial water inlets that divide land masses. Getting over one means taking a ferry, and that can add hours to a car trip.


Because fjords can be up to a mile deep, building a bridge over the waterway or tunnel underneath is not very practical.


But Norwegian engineers think they can build a quicker way. They want to float concrete tunnels up to 100 feet below the ocean&#x2019;s surface. 


This would allow ships to sail unobstructed by bridges. Floating pontoons would hold the concrete tunnels in place. Engineers hope the ambitious $25 billion project will be completed by 2035.</description>

      <title>New Mercedes-Benz cars blast &#x2018;pink noise&#x2019; to protect drivers&#x2019; hearing during accidents</title>
      <description>STUTTGART, GERMANY &#x2014; Mercedes-Benz have installed new technology in its E-Class models that could protect drivers&#x2019; hearing during car crashes. 


Human ears have a natural defense against loud noises called the &#x201C;stapedius reflex&#x201D;. This is triggered when exposed to intense sound levels of around 100 decibels. Upon hearing the sound, the stapedius muscle contracts and pulls the stapes away from the oval window of the cochlea and tenses the eardrum. It&#x2019;s here that it reflects the noise, instead of transmitting it to the inner ear.


According to a post on the official Mercedes-Benz website, the company has installed a special sound chip in its new E-Class cars. This technology generates sound known as pink noise &#x2014;  played at a volume of 80 decibels &#x2014; to prepare the ears before an accident. Since it is a spectrum of frequencies, it doesn&#x2019;t need to be played at a high volume to trigger the stapedius reflex.


When the car detects an imminent accident, it automatically plays pink noise through the sound system. This is is said to protect the ears from the high level of noise that typically accompanies a crash.</description>
